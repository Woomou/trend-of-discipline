TI Expectations about real returns - Are they realistic?
SO JOURNAL OF PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB In this article, the authors provide empirical evidence concerning real returns for stocks and bonds in order to consider their impact on spending rules for large portfolios. Their analysis of the data supports the argument that 5% (or higher) real returns are not sustainable in the long run. Therefore, an endowment fund that is invested in equities, spends 5% a year, and earns the real return on stocks will, in all likelihood, see its market value decline below the beginning value at some point, absent new contributions. The actual record, shown in the article from a probability standpoint, could lead institutional investors in particular to reformulate their expectations about real returns, and may also influence individual investors' expectations about future real returns.

TI New methods of modeling water availability for agriculture under climate

   Cornbelt
ID OCEAN-ATMOSPHERE MODEL
AB This paper reports on new methods of linking climate change scenarios with hydrologic, agricultural an water planning models to study future water availability for agriculture, an essential element of sustainability. The study is based on the integration of models of water supply and demand, and of crop growth and irrigation management. Consistent modeling assumptions, available databases, and scenario simulations are used to capture a range of possible future conditions. The linked models include WATBAL for water supply; CERES, SOYGRO, and CROPWAT for crop and irrigation modeling; and WEAP for water demand forecasting, planning and evaluation. These models are applied to the U.S. Cornbelt using forecasts of climate change, agricultural production, population and GDP growth.
   Results suggest that, at least in the near term, the relative abundance of water for agriculture can be maintained under climate change conditions. However, increased water demands from urban growth, increases in reservoir evaporation and increases in crop consumptive use must be accommodated by timely improvements in crop, irrigation and drainage technology, water management, and institutions. These improvements are likely to require substantial resources and expertise. In the highly irrigated basins of the region, irrigation demand greatly exceeds industrial and municipal demands. When improvements in irrigation efficiency are tested, these basins respond by reducing demand and lessening environmental stress with an improvement in system reliability, effects particularly evident under a high technology scenario. Rainfed lands in the Cornbelt are not forced to invest in irrigation, but there is some concern about increased water-logging during the spring and consequent required increased investment in agricultural drainage. One major water region in the Cornbelt also provides a useful caveat: change will not necessarily be continuous and monotonic. Under one GCM scenario for the 2010s, the region shows a significant decrease in system reliability, while the scenario for the 2020s shows an increase.

DE distillery; organic fertilizer; paddy field; spent wash liquor; Thailand
AB Spent wash liquor (or stillage) from the Excise Department's distillery plant at Ubonratchathani Province, Thailand, has a flow-rate of 550 m(3)/d. About 100 m(3)/d of the liquor are fed to an anaerobic digester by the 'upflow anaerobic sludge blanket' process - the remainder being transferred directly to a large storage lagoon. The digested liquor is then diluted and pumped during the dry season (December to July) to 400 ha of paddy fields; this has resulted in a 2-3 fold increase in rice yield. Also, the liquor serves as an oxygen-depletion aid which inhibits the growth of thrips and eradicates insect pests. In return, the farmers save 66-80 p/m(3) in terms of equivalent chemical fertilizer and insecticides. This direct use of spent wash liquor is a promising trend towards sustainable development in developing countries.

ID SMALL COMMUNITIES; REED BEDS
AB The use of sub-surface flow constructed wetlands planted with Phragmites australis (the common reed) for the treatment of sewage is now widespread in the UK. The strategy for the use of reed-beds by a major UK water utility is reviewed in terms of whether the process (a) is appropriate within the rural environment, (b) offers satisfactory performance, and (c) meets criteria for sustainability. Its use for secondary, tertiary and storm-water treatment is considered. Odour generation has been a concern for secondary treatment reed-beds and has been measured and modelled to identify the required minimum distance to properties to eliminate any possibility of odour nuisance.

   MANAGEMENT

DT Article
DE basement aquifers; groundwater protection; pollution; sustainability
AB Lower Palaeozoic and Precambrian rocks are distributed in Scotland, Northern Ireland, Cumbria, Wales and the Channel Islands, and coincide largely with upland areas. Groundwater flow and storage is mostly shallow and flow paths are short, although there is some limited deeper groundwater circulation. Groundwater quality is variable but often weakly mineralized, reflecting incomplete water-rod; reaction. There are many small groundwater sources used for private supply and a number also for public supply; these offer an important social and economic asset to isolated rural and island communities. Groundwater occurs in four rock types. fractured rock, fractured rock with regolith, massive rock and karstic limestone. Identification of specific groundwater settings within these rock types provides an insight into the prevailing groundwater flow paths. This enables source protection zones to be prescribed according to the hydrogeological setting rather than by detailed data collection and modelling. This method of prescription is applicable universally to basement aquifers and is not limited to those in the UK.

AB Preliminary results from a large-scale testbed of advanced lighting control technologies at the Phillip Burton Federal Building in San Francisco are presented. The first year objective of this project is to determine the sustainable energy savings and cost-effectiveness of different lighting control technologies compared to a portion of the building where only minimal controls are installed. The paper presents the analyzed results from 6 months of tests focused on accurately characterizing the energy savings potential of one type of daylight-linked lighting controls compared to the lighting in similar open-planned areas without dimming controls. After analyzing a half year's data, we determined that the annual energy savings for this type of daylight-linked controls was 41 percent and 30 percent for the outer rows of lights on the south and north sides of the building, respectively The annual energy savings dropped to 22 percent and 16 percent for the second row of lights for the south and north, respectively, and was negligible for the third rows of lights.

DT Article
AB This paper summarizes research that investigated a range of suburban development alternatives from an urban hydrology perspective. increasingly sustainable urban fringe design is characterized in this work by a mix of single family dwellings, semidetached dwellings, townhouses and apartments, a gridiron street pattern, smaller lot sizes, narrower streets, and significant open space. An analysis of a number of design scenarios based on the above characteristics was conducted for a representative urban fringe development application, with the aid of a storm water runoff simulation model (QUALHYMO) and geographical information sytstems software. Geographical information systems played an indispensable role in forming a connecting link between the spatial data and the simulation model, performing such tasks as watershed delineation, hydrologic parameter determination, location of developable areas, and presentation of design scenario applications. The rainfall and runoff model was used to simulate the peak how and total runoff volume of a regional storm under current and future land use conditions. The results show that increasingly sustainable designs with smaller total development areas can effectively reduce peak flows and total runoff volumes when compared with less sustainable designs. The results of this research will be of interest to municipal engineers and local decision makers who are considering the range of possible effects of development proposals on their communities.

AB Multinational corporations are continually seeking sources of competitive advantage. Iii addition to strategic, technological, financial, and organizational capabilities as sources of competitive advantage, this paper argues that ethical capability also can be an important source of sustainable advantage. The paper presents the challenges of ethics in an international context, discusses the resource-based view of competitive advantage, and describes how a multinational company can develop and sustain ethical capability: through the related processes of transformational leadership, organizational learning, and human resource management.

AB Development threats to beautiful and productive agricultural areas occur throughout the world. This case study of one such productive valley reveals its agricultural uniqueness to Mexico and the pressures for its industrialization. Landscape and regional planning and environmental impact assessment tools were applied to suggest compatible and sustainable uses. Five environmental units were selected according to a digital model of the terrain and the overlapping of ecological maps, aerial photos and Landsat images. Descriptions included both natural and transformed physical attributes. Cultural and landscape architecture parameters were added to evaluate the aesthetics of each unit.: Contrasting six potential land-uses (agriculture, agri-industry, tourism-recreation, urban, range management for cattle, and conservation) generated the capacity for sustained land-use, together with an environmental impact assessment. Economic means for directing land-use toward sustainability are to be developed by the local government. Community organization, local political pressure and the tastes of the national government will dictate its future use. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

ID FOREST TEMPORAL DYNAMICS; DISTURBANCE; LANDSCAPE; MODEL
AB Decisions for sustainable forest resources management require a better understanding of forest dynamics as a result of disturbances. Forest fires are one of the major types of natural disturbances in many forest landscapes. Existing fire regime models can be used in evaluating the influence of a fire regime on landscape dynamics, but these models require users to define fire frequency and its size distribution as separate characteristics of a fire regime before running the models. By using a long-term spatial fire regime model, we tested the hypothesis that fire frequency and its size distribution are correlated with each other under natural conditions. Our study demonstrates that the hypothesis can not be rejected and the correlation between fire frequency and its size distribution was robust. Thus, the natural fire size distribution can be estimated when the fire return interval for a given forest landscape is known, if the natural fire size distribution can be approximated by a negative exponential probability distribution. This result simplifies the description of a fire regime from two parameters to one in some existing fire regime models. This simplification is limited to a 'let burn' scenario.

AB A survey of imposer was conducted between the Bay of San Vicente, Concepcion, Chile (36 degrees 50') and the Bay of Renocavi, Puerto Montt, Chile (41 degrees 35'), to determine if imposer is occurring in an area of collection and cultivation of the gastropod, Chorus giganteus, Imposer was recorded in three chilean muricids C.giganteus, Xanthochorus us cassidiformis and Nucella crassilabrum complex. Percentage of imposer in females sampled ranged from 0% to 100%, The degree of expression of imposer was not so severe as to elicit sterility in the individuals surveyed. Incidence of imposer was as high as 47% in areas of harvest of C. giganteus for reproductive and cultivation studies for commercial production of this species. A six percent incidence of imposer was observed in Nucella proximal to the facility for cultivation of C. giganteus. Gastropods of the genus Nucella are used in other countries to monitor incidence of imposer and have demonstrated sensitivity toward tributyltin (TBT), the associated causal agent. Since sex of individuals in muriciculture is determined by the presence or absence of a penis, imposer may lead to erroneous classification of males and females. The incidence and severity of imposer in C. giganteus and related species may have a negative impact on sustainable cultivation and harvest of gastropods in Chile. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Purpose: The aim of the study is to compare data on anaerobic and aerobic energy conversion during exercise of high intensity leading to exhaustion. Several different data sources are used, including data extracted from mathematical analyses of world and Olympic running records, data from laboratory tests, and data based on biochemical information. Methods: Theoretical relationships are derived and comparisons are made of the ratio of aerobic to total energy contributions as functions of time. Results: The ratio is shown to depend not only on the duration of the high-intensity exercise but also in part on a factor lambda, which governs the rate of anaerobic and aerobic energy release. A further important factor is the value of the parameter Q/lambda, which is the ratio of anaerobic capacity to maximum sustainable aerobic power. Values in the range 55 s < Q/lambda < 72 s and 0.030 s(-1) < lambda < 0.042 s(-1) are shown to provide the best correlation of data. The results indicate that the ratio of maximal anaerobic power to maximum aerobic power lies in the range from 2.0 to 2.6. Conclusion: Data extracted from the mathematical models of running are generally more consistent than the body of experimental data. This may indicate that the inherent difficulties of laboratory techniques relating to the measurement of anaerobic energy conversion are giving rise to significant experimental errors.

TI To see or not to see? Midwives' perceptions of reduced antenatal
   attendances for 'low-risk' women
SO MIDWIFERY
LA English
DT Article
ID QUALITATIVE RESEARCH; CARE; SCHEDULES
AB Objective: to explore the views of midwives towards traditional and flexible schedules of antenatal attendance for women at low risk.
   Design: a qualitative approach using focus groups.
   Setting: three NHS Trusts providing maternity care in and around Bristol,
   Sample: 14 midwives who had provided antenatal care to women participating in the Bristol Antenatal Care Study.
   Findings: midwives generally expressed support for a move away from the traditional schedule of antenatal attendances, suggesting that this represented a move towards the acceptance of pregnancy as a normal life event,They recognised that some women would prefer flexible care and the possibility of a reduction in the number of antenatal attendances. However, they suggested that some women would require additional information in order to feel confident in these circumstances. The midwives also recognised that both they and pregnant women have reservations about reducing contact during the antenatal period. Central to these reservations is a concern that women's psychosocial as well as physical needs may go unmet if antenatal contact is reduced.
   Implications for practice: although in principle supporting a move away from the traditional schedule of antenatal attendances, the reservations felt by midwives towards a reduction in antenatal attendances are reflected in their practice. These concerns currently impede any radical move away from the traditional schedule of antenatal check-ups and will need to be addressed by midwifery managers prior to the implementation of a more flexible schedule of antenatal attendances, if any such change is to be sustainable.

TI Sustainability, economics and energy
SO NATIONALOKONOMISK TIDSSKRIFT
LA Danish
DT Article
AB The paper examines the concept of sustainability as defined and applied within resource and environmental economics. There are a number of conflicting interpretations of sustainability which are presented in this paper: They mainly differ in two aspects: One regards the possibility of substituting natural for man-made capital, and the other concerns discounting These differences do to some extent reflect different empirical assumptions, e.g. relating to technological innovation. However there is clearly also a disagreement concerning values and ethical principles involved. It is argued that underlying the economic discussion about substitution is a profound disagreement regarding whether nature only has economic value as a resource or must be valued according to other standards. Underlying the discussion about discounting is an argument concerning principles of intra- and intergenerational distributive justice. The Danish energy policy is used as a paradigm case. The main aim of the paper is to give a comprehensive picture of the ethical assumptions implicitly made by economic sustainability theory.

AB Since Organic vegetable producers in the United States cannot use synthetic pesticides, they must rely on alternative methods for pest management. In an organic vegetable: production system in southwest Florida, summer solarization, compost, summer cover crops, and a resistant cultivar were used to manage Meloidogyne incognita and other plant-parasitic nematodes in a double-crop system with susceptible vegetable crops. Ar the beginning of autumn crops:bf tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) and pepper (Capsicum annuum), population levels of M.. incognita were lowest following summer solarization, intermediate following summer cover crops of browntop miller (Panicum ramosum), 'Iron Clay' cowpea (Vigna unguiculata), or marigold (Tagetes minuta), and greatest following compost alone or a control (summer weeds). Most treatment differences did not persist into a spring vegetable crop. The exception was a treatment with 'Sanibel' tomato, from which no nl. incognita were recovered even at the end of the spring crop. In this case, the integration of a summer cowpea cover crop and a resistant cultivar was successful in managing M. incognita and improving yield of tomato in rotation with pepper.

AB Mixed farming systems have potential agronomic, environmental and socio-economic advantages over specialized farming systems. This paper attempts to quantify these advantages for the Dutch province Flevoland. A mixed farming system at regional lever is characterized by intensive co-operation between two or more specialized farms, each producing crop or animal products. To test the hypothesis that such a mixed farming system might improve sustainability of agriculture in Flevoland, nutrient balances, labour requirements and labour income were quantified for a specialized arable farm, a specialized dairy farm and both combined into a mixed farming system, exchanging land, labour and machinery. Scope for reduced biocide use in the mixed farming system was assessed in a qualitative way. In the mixed farming system labour income per ha was 25% higher. Seventy percent of this increase could be explained through higher yields per ha of the profitable crops ware potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) and sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.). The remaining 30% resulted from lower costs, mainly through a better utilization of available labour. Differences between the combined nutrient balance of both specialized farms and that of the mixed farming system were small. Indications of reduced biocide use in the mixed farming system could not be found. It was concluded that in a mixed farming system it is possible to realize a higher income without increasing environmental pollution. Key factor is the ratio between animal and arable production, determining the extent to which crop rotations can be widened and the relative amounts of slurry that can be applied to grassland.

AB Two adjacent studies of sheep-grazed mixed-species pasture, on a Pukaki/Tekapo high country soil, have been on-going since 1982. One compared 30 combinations of 5 increasing growth regimes (0-500 kg ha(-1) yr-(1) superphosphate +irrigation) x 3 stocking rates x 2 stocking methods; the other compared 27 combinations of P and S fertiliser (0-100 kg ha(-1) yr(-1)). Summer shoot concentrations of P, S, N, and other macro- and micro-nutrients in Lupinus polyphyllus, Trifolium ambiguum, 2: hybridum, 2: repens, T. pratense, Hieracium pilosella, Festuca rubra, and Dactylis glomerata are reported for the PxS study. Dactylis glomerata was notable for its large change in shoot P and S concentration with changes in P and S soil levels, whereas Lupinus polyphyllus and Festuca rubra showed low variation in S shoot concentration, and Hieracium pilosella low variation in shoot P concentration, under varying fertilisers rates and combinations. Species tended to have their highest shoot S concentration where they made their major contribution in mixed swards. Herbage Se, I, and Na levels were low to deficient for sheep nutrition.

AB This paper presents the first Hungarian data on doubled haploid maize plants recovered from mechanically isolated microspores. The androgenic response and plant regenerating capacity of the three-way cross maize genotype (PH TC) were tested under simplified isolation and culture conditions. Six sustainable and regenerable cultures were produced. Four microspore lines were fertile and set seeds. The hybrid (MH SC) of two such pure lines showed significant heterosis in terms of F-1 plant viability, fertility rate and productivity. The viability of the MH SC microspores was higher (29.7%) than that of PH TC (18.64%) in the early cultural stage. The cultural test of three media revealed the advantage of the, modified protoplast culture medium (mN6M) over ppN6M/89 (Morocz et al. 1990) and mYP (Gaillard et al. 1991) in the early phase of culture.

TI Environmental impacts of technological change in Bangladesh agriculture:
   farmers' perceptions and empirical evidence
SO OUTLOOK ON AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
AB Concern about the environmental impacts of technological change in agriculture, and studies exploring farmers' perceptions of this issue are nascent. This paper provides an insight into the environmental impacts of modern agricultural technology, as perceived by Bangladeshi farmers. This is supported by material evidence such as soil fertility, and analyses of fertilizer and pesticide use, foodgrain production and fish catches. Farmers are well aware of the adverse environmental impacts of modern agricultural technology, although their awareness remains confined within the daily experience of their local environment, and is limited to matters such as soil fertility, fish catches and health effects. Farmers' perceptions of impacts such as toxicity in water and soils, are weak. Raising farmers' awareness of these tangible and intangible environmental impacts of modern agricultural technology is urgently needed for the development of sustainable agriculture.

AB Winter abundances of earthworms were monitored in five permanent pastures in South Australia for nine years. The earthworm communities in these five pastures were dominated by exotic Lumbricidae, mostly Aporrectodea species, but indigenous Megascolecidae, e.g. Gemascolex species, were also common at some sites. Earthworm abundance and biomass varied markedly between sites, years and species, with different temporal patterns observed for some species at separate sites. Dominance hierarchies varied in time within communities. Major changes in earthworm abundance were associated with a particularly wet year. Aggregation indices also varied between species. Implications from the data for modelling the influence of earthworms on soil properties and pasture production and for the use of earthworms as indicators of agricultural sustainability are discussed. The study was supplemented with data from two extensive regional surveys of earthworm communities in South Australia(113 sites) and western Victoria (163 sites).

AB Allolobophora chlorotica and Aporrectodea longa were inoculated into a clay landfill site cap at Calvert, Buckinghamshire during the Spring of 1992,. Monitoring of these animals, their offspring and natural colonists of the site using a variety of methods, has occurred since then. Both inoculated species have established sustainable populations, with an index of cast-counting showing that A. longa numbers have at least doubled. The spread of this species has been steady, but slow through the compacted day cap, with worms moving up to 10 m from points of inoculation after 5 years (mean value 2.3 m). From digging and hand-sorting of samples, A. chlorotica has been shown to move comparable distances and earthworm densities overall are now at least 110 m(-2). Numbers of A. chlorotica were significantly (p < 0.05) higher in areas where both species were inoculated, compared to areas where they were inoculated in isolation. Other species found on site include Eiseniella tetraedra and Lumbricus rubellus. Although the inoculated earthworm populations appear to be expanding and flourishing, physical soil conditions have not changed significantly over the study period. The rate of amelioration of this type of material would appear to be extremely slow and introduction of earthworms can only partially meet this requirement.

AB Many commercial practices for vermiculture have been developed. The conversion rate of organic material through the worms is directly inline with the number of worms in the system. Beds and continuous flow systems are widely used commercially in many countries. In South Africa both systems are used with varying results and for different applications. A difference in the population reproductive capacity of beds and containers (flow-through) have been noticed and were studied. In this study both systems were fed with the same organic material before the experimental period and during the experimental period. Eighty-four clitellate individuals from each system (bed - and a container systems) were used in the study. The hatchlings were counted and removed over a 90 day period. The experiment was conducted outdoors in commercial conditions. The earthworms from the bed system reproduced at normal levels, Anisopary was observed as follows: 38 % hypoparous and 62 % hyperparous.
   The earthworms from the containers hardly kept the population number stable. Anisopary was observed as follows; 91 % hypoparous and 9 hyperparous. Hypopary worms (male functioning) were dominant in the container population. This was probably due to population stress in the containers. This factor may influence the life span of container populations and vermicompost production in the long run. The conversion rate of organic material was not affected during the study period. The question arises whether such populations can be sustainable for long periods or should be supplemented to keep up conversion rates in commercial projects.

AB This paper describes the work of a multidisciplinary, inter-agency team, comprising officers from a recently formed unitary authority and a region of the Environment Agency, to promote the more widespread use of sustainable approaches to tackling drainage problems arising from surface water runoff. Interest in this topical subject is gathering pace nationally and the environmentally positive aspects of this alternative approach are highlighted, The paper provides a brief technical overview of the subject, including the various techniques available. The unitary authority in question is an area subject to considerable development pressure and the paper describes the initiatives taken to pursue changes in planning policy and practices to facilitate the more widespread introduction of the sustainable drainage initiative. The role of elected members at various stages in the process is described. Selected case studies of actual schemes are presented briefly, to help illustrate the range of potential applications.

AB The valleys of Neath and Port Talbot have borne the effect of several of the most serious polluting discharges from abandoned coal mines in Britain. This type of pollution is occurring elsewhere across the coalfields of Britain following the colliery closures of recent years and is the source of contamination for hundreds of miles of river and other watercourses, including water otherwise intended for industrial and household abstraction. This paper explains the cause of minewater contamination and uses as examples the River Pelenna Minewater Project and the Ynysarwed Minewater Project to demonstrate the proactive, coordinating role that the local authority can take in resolving such problems sustainably in the interests of the local community, the wider environment and the economy. The different characters of the two discharges and their immediate environs have raised significantly different civil engineering design, finance and construction challenges in marrying together the demands of environmental science, process flow engineering, land availability, topography, ground conditions, access, aesthetics and seasonal working within the context of local planning authority and Environment Agency constraints.

AB Physical geographers in New Zealand have a tradition of applied research in a variety of contexts, including environmental management as well as soil, vegetation and landform systems conservation. In recent years this work has been given new impetus (with the promise of even greater involvement) as a result of economic restructuring at the national level, restructuring of government departments and agencies dealing with environmental and resource management and conservation, the introduction of new statutes relating to environmental and resource management, and major changes in the funding and management of science research in the public sector.
   This article provides an overview of the institutional environment within which New Zealand physical geographers now carry out applied work. The contemporary resource management and legislative contexts are described and structural changes that have taken place in New Zealand science over the last decade are reviewed. Research undertaken by the authors or their research students provides examples of the different types of work now being undertaken by physical geographers in New Zealand under the new legislative and funding regimes. Two examples are described in detail. The first is drawn from research dealing with catchment hydrology and water supply and has been undertaken by a physical geographer employed by Landcare Research, a Crown-owned research company. The second comes from work carried out by two university-based physical geographers into the environmental effects on coasts of a new mode of marine passenger transport ('fast ferries'), to meet the requirements of new environmental legislation.

SO PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article; Proceedings Paper
CT Public Administration and Development Jubilee Conference

AB The future for people lies increasingly in and around cities. Government actions within cities, including those assisted by aid efforts, have tended to concentrate on a few key services. Those services have been remarkably similar over time, consisting of public health services, public transport, sanitation, solid waste management and water supply. The provision of those services, and the needs for government intervention, has been historically justified on grounds of economic development, environmental sustainability or social equity. This article addresses the hypothesis that the core concerns of providing a better environment have changed little over 50 years (nor indeed since the great influenza epidemic that struck India and Britain in the late 1840s). The question it poses is whether those concerns will change much over the next 50 years. The magnitude will be greater; by 2050 it is likely that three out of four people will live in or near cities. Priorities, technologies and management methods appear to have undergone great changes. The language of urban or environmental management has also changed. How important have been those changes? How new are the current concerns with the new public management, private financing of public services, public-private partnerships, service inclusion and targeting the poor, or participatory development? The article highlights the need to view current means to manage the environments of essentially poor people in the context of the ends and purpose of such management.

TI Sustainable metal management exemplified by copper in the USA
SO REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE
LA English
DT Article
AB A sustainable management of non-renewable metals calls for scientific-ecological understanding of the regional material household. The copper household in the USA between 1900 and 2100 was chosen to illustrate mathematical modelling of such systems. Relatively limited and inaccurate sets of data already allow a first approximation of the metal management system. The copper fluxes of the 20th century have contributed to the formation of two new ore deposits of the same order of magnitude as the currently still available reservoir (90 million tons), i.e. copper stock in consumption products (approx. 70 million tons) and in land fills (approx. 40 million tons). The "land fill", therefore, contains copper whose potential use is lost due to dilution. The long-term copper consumption stock is greater than the short-term stock. Scenarios show that the current economically mineable Cu-stocks will be exhausted in 30 to 50 years if a change in the existing management system does not occur. In case of a reorientation, the use of copper as a "new resource" in the consumption stocks appears to be the most promising strategy. The future waste management processes will have to increase their copper recycling rates.

AB In this paper, a system dynamics model is described, which simulates long-term trends in the production and consumption of metals (i.e. iron/steel and an aggregate of metals of medium abundance) in relation to impacts such as ore-grade decline, capital and energy requirements and waste flows. This metal model can be of assistance in exploring the issue of sustainability of metal resource use. Application of the model to historical trends shows it to be fairly capable of reproducing the long-term trends in the 1900-1990 period, among others on the basis of two intensity of use curves applied to 13 world regions. For future trends, a set of perspective-based long-term scenarios has been constructed that represent the major paradigms in resource use. These scenarios highlight some of the uncertain factors in the relation between economic growth, metal resource exploitation and use, and energy and environmental consequences. They also indicate that apparently similar metal flows in society may be the result of quite different and sometimes contrary assumptions on metal demand, production patterns and resource base characteristics. Such analyses contribute to a more open and transparent discussion on the issue at hand by adding quantitative explications to qualitative views. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Sustainability and the primary extraction industries: theories and

SO RESOURCES POLICY
LA English
DT Article
ID RESOURCES; POLICY
AB This paper reflects on how sustainability is being interpreted both theoretically and in practice for the primary extraction industries. Two contrasting perspectives can be adopted: one states that continued extraction of non-renewable resources is a necessary part of sustainable development, whilst the other states that extraction of these resources must be greatly reduced or even eliminated. It is shown that these different approaches can be traced back to underlying, often unarticulated, assumptions about the acceptability of trade-offs between different societal goals; attitudes towards uncertainties in scientific analysis and the reliability of management systems; and the perceived appropriateness of system boundaries at different conceptual scales. These assumptions are founded in the self-perception of organisations and individuals about their roles in society, and the cultural context within which these organisations and individuals define their raison d'etre.

AB The multinational corporation (MNC) is dichotomous in nature. While on the one hand it is a vehicle for private capital accumulation, when socially-embedded it may serve as a means to further social provisioning and social justice. A social economics approach to the MNC is developed to incorporate both private and social transaction costs in international production and trade where the divergence in these costs may require collective action to mitigate the effects of social dislocation. These issues are illustrated by experiments in corporate codes of conduct related to child labor and environmental sustainability. Since corporate codes may be insufficient to socially embed the activities of MNCs, efforts to develop supranational governance mechanisms to better achieve social justice are also considered.

AB Spanish ecosystems contain a great richness of species in spite of being subjected to ancestral human exploitation. The article stresses the importance of the traditional agricultural-forestry-pasture systems in the maintenance of biological diversity. Specifically analyzed is the role of one of the characteristics of these systems, namely the spatial configuration of the landscapes. That is, the relative spatial position occupied by their elements in the territory. In many cases, this characteristic is the result of an historic and continued optimization of natural resources management. The configuration of the landscape affects the horizontal flow of energy and nutrients, thus conditioning the ecosystems' possibilities of organization and modifying their production values and biological diversity. This has been shown in two studies carried out with very different approaches in two very different Spanish agricultural-forestry-pasture systems (caserios and dehesas). In both cases, spatial configuration of their landscape determines changes in the biological diversity values of the vegetation. In the particular case of the dehesas, their peculiar configuration is a crucial factor in understanding the efficiency of the nutrient use and the exceptionally high biological diversity factors of their pastures. While some environmental policies give priority to the conservation of large habitats with uniform little altered landscapes, the article stresses the importance of understanding the heterogeneity and configuration of the agricultural-forestry-pasture landscapes as an example in the quest for productive systems of high naturalistic value. This is particularly important in the case of the unprotected Spanish spaces (over 90% of the territory), when the idea of sustainable development needs to be applied.

ID POST-FORDISM
AB The globalization of socio-economic relations is a central topic of discussion in both the general literature on economy and society and in the area of food and agriculture. Many maintain that we are in a transition from one era, termed Fordism, to another, called Global Post-Fordism. We use the case of two fisheries eco-labeling programs to inform discussions regarding the emergence of stabilizing socio-economic mechanisms in the Global Post-Fordist era. We argue that recent developments in the tuna-dolphin case, the first major experiment with eco-labeling a in the fisheries industries, combined with the Marine Stewardship Council, an initiative designed to regulate and certify a system of global "sustainable fisheries" through an eco-labeling program, provide valuable insights into the ideological and organizational structure of salient global actors in the Post-Fordist era. The discussion addresses (1) the contested terrain within the "North" and between the "North" and the "South" regarding eco-legislation to regulate the global fisheries; (2) the fracturing of the environmental movement into "mainstream" and "grassroots" camps and the resulting inability to maintain a coordinated agenda to counter the globalization project: and (3) the emergence of new forms of supranational state-like regulatory mechanisms that combine science with free trade and environmental ideals and propose to resolve the global fisheries crises by providing sustainable socio-economic coordination. We conclude that the emergence of these supra-national state-like NGOs raises important implications for the sovereignty of nation-states and democratic action on the part of subordinate groups opposed to the globalization project.

AB Fishery dependent data from various commercial and recreational sampling programs form the basis for characterizing the fishery for dolphinfish (Coryphaenus hippurus) in the waters of the Gulf of Mexico and off the southeastern U.S. coast. Three states in the region have implemented size and bag limits for dolphinfishes, but there are no federal regulations in place at this time. Commercial landings were relatively small in comparison to recreational landings from 1984 through 1996. In 1995 however, commercial landings in the Atlantic Ocean of the southeastern U.S. were almost twice the weight of the previous years. The average weight per fish was calculated for each water body and fishing sector and there appear to have been significant increases in the average weight of fish landed both in the commercial and recreational sectors in the Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico. Catch per unit of effort is measured as numbers of fish caught per angler per hour in the recreational fishery and has been variable since the early 1980s. In light of increasing landings and average weights of fish landed since the 1980s, the sustainability of this fishery must be fully evaluated.

AB This paper examines four issues central to the relationships between environmental resources, population and sustainability in Zimbabwe. First, the conceptualisation of population-resource interrelationships and sustainability. Second, the legal basis of land use practices and origins of land use conflict within and between Zimbabwe's main population groups. Third, the demographic threats to sustainable resource development and the impact of the Structural Adjustment Programmes (SAPs) on rural and urban communities. Fourth, the dynamics of population change and environmental resource use constraints including resettlement and land redistribution or reform programmes. It is concluded that the relationships between environmental degradation and population pressure are complex. Sustainable environmental resource use to supply basic Livelihoods can be achieved if appropriate technical expertise or backup is provided to the population. Developing and implementing sustainable resource development strategies in Zimbabwe requires attention to socio-economic and political challenges.

ID MATERNAL MORTALITY; CARE
AB Referral between first and second levels of care in rural African health systems is an extremely complex problem. Problems that have plagued the process of referral include poor service quality, low availability of trained personnel, inadequate supplies of drugs and medical diagnostic equipment and inadequate communication infrastructure. In this paper, the authors analyse the role of transport costs in the utilization of referral and how community health insurance schemes can help reduce the economic burden of transport costs, thereby improving referral utilization and health outcomes. Following the introduction, the authors provide a conceptual framework of the individual; household- and community-level factors that affect referral in the rural African context, with particular emphasis on the role of the time and monetary costs of transport and the potential role of community risk-sharing schemes. The paper then presents a detailed case study from Kenya where a community has been experimenting with a health insurance scheme which provides emergency transport for emergency referral. Data from the past eight years of experience in northern Kenya suggests that support for the insurance scheme has depended on the reliability of the health system, as well as the seasons and Various external problems, such as political interference, drought and insecurity. Conclusions drawn support the idea of community financing schemes for transport, not merely as a lifesaving strategy in remote and resource-poor health infrastructures, but also as a means to help build trust in the health system itself and thus improve sustainability through local institutional support.

AB Immunization is one of the major public health interventions to prevent childhood morbidity and death. The Expanded Programme on Immunization has gathered momentum worldwide since 1974. The range of vaccines in the programme is being expanded in the years to come. All across the globe, a high level of vaccination coverage has been reached and now needs to be sustained. In part, the coverage has been made possible by the broad acceptance of vaccinations, although there are variations resulting in different configurations of fully, partially and non-immunized children. Using the results of studies carried out by the Social Science and Immunization Project in Bangladesh, Ethiopia, India, Malawi, the Netherlands and the Philippines, this article describes and discusses patterns of vaccination acceptance and non-acceptance. It shows how context affects acceptance of vaccinations, and analyses the underlying reasons behind refusal and resistance. The article also develops conceptual tools for the analysis of acceptance and non-acceptance and discusses explanatory theoretical perspectives. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Sexed semen will contribute to increased profitability of dairy and beef cattle production in a variety of ways. It could be used to produce offspring of the desired sex from a particular mating to take advantage of differences in value of males and females for specific marketing purposes. Commercial dairy farmers, those who produce and market milk, could use sexed semen to produce replacement daughters from genetically superior cows and beef crossbred sons from the remainder of their cow population. To increase the rate of response to selection. seedstock dairy cattle breeders could produce bulls for progeny testing from a smaller number of elite dams by using sexed semen to ensure that all of them produced a son. Using sexed semen could then reduce the cost of progeny testing those bulls, because fewer matings would be necessary to produce any required number of daughters. Commercial beef cattle farmers, producing animals for eventual slaughter, could use sexed semen to capitalize on the higher value of male than female offspring for meat production. They could also use sexed semen to produce specialized, genetically superior replacement heifers from as small a proportion of the herd as possible. This would allow the remainder of the herd to produce male calves from bulls or breeds with superior genetic merit for growth, feed conversion efficiency, and carcass merit. Single-sex, bred-heifer systems, in which each female is sold for slaughter soon after weaning her replacement daughter, would be possible with the use of X-chromosome-sorted semen. Use of sexed semen would make terminal crossbreeding systems more efficient and sustainable in beef cattle. Fewer females would be required to produce specialized maternal crossbred daughters, and more could be devoted to producing highly efficient, terminal crossbred sons.

AB In spite of frequent claims to the contrary, there is very little evidence that health systems research actually influences policy-making. Based on a case study from Thailand and a literature review, we develop a stakeholder-oriented model of policy-making. We argue that only if stakeholders' needs are taken into consideration during design and implementation of scientific projects and dissemination of the results, research will have a chance to influence the policy process. From this model, we derive a five-step approach to enhance the use of research by various stakeholders. We then propose institutional arrangements and conditions to make the use of research for policy-making more sustainable.

TI Promoting urban sustainability: The case for a tradable supplementary
   licence system for vehicle use
SO URBAN STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
AB Many large cities in the world have serious regional air-quality problems, largely the product of vehicular emissions, and one manifestation of the argued insustainability of current urban growth patterns. These problems are frequently blamed on unrestricted use of private vehicles. This paper applies the concept of sustainability to urban areas by formulating an explicit ecological constraint on airshed capacity in a region within a model of cost-effective emissions control. Solution of the model suggests that restrictions on vehicle use should play a role in achieving regional air-quality targets cost-effectively. A tradable vehicle-use permit system is described for implementing the sustainability constraint, and its relationship to other demand management proposals for constraining vehicle use is discussed, as well as the implications for the form and vitality of urban areas. This control policy would have substantially favourable impacts on air quality, vehicle congestion and uncontrolled suburban development and, given the general political unacceptability of environmental taxes, could form part of a workable and politically palatable set of policies to control greenhouse-gas emissions from the transport sector. The proposed vehicle-use permits mechanism represents a natural extension of current discussions for globally tradable carbon emission permits, and could be a principal method by which such national carbon emissions budgets might be allocated regionally.

AB The paper describes the priority given to licensing in the control of waste management in the UK. It outlines both the historical and present day impact of EU legislation on UK practices and explains potential problems and benefits resulting from the implementation of the EU landfill directive. Basic waste data is given and some of the key factors underpinning waste regulation are delineated primarily sustainable development - but also land-use planning, groundwater protection and global climate change. The paper concludes by profiling the UK's lifecycle programme for waste management and its intended uses.

ID WASTE-WATER; PERFORMANCE
AB The biological anaerobic-aerobic treatment of medium-strength municipal landfill leachate (COD (chemical oxygen demand) 1500 to 3200 mg l(-1); BOD7 (biological oxygen demand) 1200 to 1900 mg l(-1); NH4-N 80 to 270 mg l(-1)) was studied by using a pilot-scale Upflow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket (UASB) reactor (13 to 28 degrees C) and laboratory-scale activated sludge reactors (5 to 11 degrees C). In the sequential process, 80 to 90% COD removal was achieved with an effluent COD of 250 to 350 mg l(-1) and a BOD7 of <10 mg l(-1). Most of the organic material was removed during anaerobic pretreatment, and more than 50% COD removal was obtained at 13 degrees C. The aerobic stage served as an ammonium removal and a polishing step. More than 90% of ammonium was efficiently removed by nitrification even at 5 degrees C. The anaerobic-aerobic treatment produced effluent fulfilling the official requirements. Furthermore, the sequential process seems sustainable and cost effective for leachate treatment at low temperatures. Based on a preliminary design, leachate treatment costs were estimated at 3.1 to 3.3 EUR m(-3) in the sequential process. This compares with the option of discharging leachates into a sewer system. Both the discharge fee and the construction and operational costs of a transfer sewer are considered.

DT Article
DE water services; user pays; organisationally integrated planning; policy
   transposition; developing country
AB This paper examines the potential issues faced by developing country water authorities when subjected to the transposition of developed country water reform policies such as user pays. A case study approach employing two mutually compatible frameworks was adopted in examining these issues. The two frameworks used were a policy transposition comparative framework and an organisationally integrated planning and revenue modelling framework. The combined comparative and modelling approach provides a form of triangulation that, it is argued strengthens support for the conclusion arrived at as a result of this study. The study found that, in terms of the case organisation, direct transposition of user pays policy was not sustainably viable. Areas for future research are identified, including improved policy review and adaptation mechanisms in facilitating bi-directional developed/developing country policy transposition.

AB The present paper analyses objectively the current experiences of Mexico in using legal and regulatory measures to manage its water resources on a long-term, sustainable basis. The strengths and weaknesses of the Mexican system should be carefully considered before other Latin American countries formulate their own individual programmes specifically. Unless this is done, non-critical transfer of knowledge and experience would undoubtedly create numerous problems in the recipient countries in the coming decades.

AB Water reform is well advanced in Australia, with extensive restructuring of administration and management under way directed towards efficient and sustainable management of the country's water resources. However, reservations have been expressed about the relevance to developing countries of the water management experience of Australia, and other parts of the developed world. Contrasting and variable conditions of water availability and use call for caution in pursuing North-South transfer of water experience without qualification and adaptation. In the process of capacity building and institutional strengthening, South-South exchange of knowledge and expertise in water resources management between developing countries is seen as the preferred approach.

AB This article presents a methodology for planning a model for the operation of a drinking water reservoir. The hedging rule distributes deficits over a longer period of time by rationing the supply of water and it makes the system sustainable with a marginal reduction in supply. A methodology is developed and demonstrated through a case study with the Chennai city (India) water supply system which is a water shortage system requiring an efficient use of water. It is aimed at improving the reservoir operation performance through the simulation-optimisation procedure with the application of the hedging rule, which is a more appropriate rule for reservoir operation under deficit conditions. To speed up the optimisation process, a neural network model is developed for the simulation of the reservoir system operation and is used instead of a conventional simulation model. The combined neural network simulation-optimisation model is used for screening the operation policies.

AB The Konan groundwater basin of Kochi Prefecture, Japan, is experiencing freshwater shortages for the past few years, particularly during the winter season. The present study aimed at analyzing the problem and exploring increased groundwater withdrawals to meet burgeoning freshwater demands in various sectors. The trend analysis of water consumption indicates that the groundwater demand would increase by 43 and 52% by the years 2010 and 2025, respectively, compared to 32 100 m(3) d(-1) at present. The streamflow of the Monobe River reduces to a minimum in winter and it shows a decreasing trend in recent years. The geologic investigation results indicate that unconfined (phreatic) aquifers comprising alluvial sand and gravel and/or diluvial silty sand and gravel are dominant, and that the northwestern and western portions of the basin have greater potential for groundwater. Groundwater flows essentially from north to south into the ocean. Groundwater level fluctuations over the basin vary appreciably in space and time, indicating a wide variation of natural recharge. Field observations confirm the hypothesis that stream-aquifer interaction also significantly contributes to groundwater recharge, besides the rainfall infiltration. Further, the pumping tests results demonstrate that though the aquifers are low-yielding, enhanced groundwater withdrawals could be possible. The aquifer hydraulic conductivity is characterized as high and ranges from 65 to 804 m d(-1) (mean = 229 m d(-1)), thereby suggesting great aquifer heterogeneity. Finally, it is concluded that the long-term sustainability of the scarce groundwater resource of the Konan basin is doubtful, and that a comprehensive analysis of the groundwater system is essential prior to formulating plans for the future groundwater development and management.

AB A long history of human-induced degradation of Great Lakes wetlands has made restoration a necessity, but the practice of wetland restoration is relatively new, especially in large lake systems. Therefore, we compiled tested methods and developed additional potential methods based on scientific understanding of Great Lakes wetland ecosystems to provide an overview of approaches for restoration. We addressed this challenge by focusing on four general fields of science: hydrology, sedimentology, chemistry, and biology. Hydrologic remediation methods include restoring hydrologic connections between diked and hydrologically altered wetlands and the lakes, restoring water tables lowered by ditching, and restoring natural variation in lake levels of regulated lakes Superior and Ontario. Sedimentological remediation methods include management of sediment input from uplands, removal or proper management of dams on tributary rivers, and restoration of protective barrier beaches and sand spits. Chemical remediation methods include reducing or eliminating inputs of contaminants from point and non-point sources, natural sediment remediation by biodegradation and chemical degradation, and active sediment remediation by removal or by in situ treatment. Biological remediation methods include control of non-target organisms, enhancing populations of target organisms, and enhancing habitat for target organisms. Some of these methods were used in three major restoration projects (Metzger Marsh on Lake Erie and Cootes Paradise and Oshawa Second Marsh on Lake Ontario), which are described as case studies to show practical applications of wetland restoration in the Great Lakes. Successful restoration techniques that do not require continued manipulation must be founded in the basic tenets of ecology and should mimic natural processes. Success is demonstrated by the sustainability, productivity, nutrient-retention ability, invasibility, and biotic interactions within a restored wetland.

AB On the basis of themes emerging in current debates on rural development in Latin America, this paper develops an analytical framework for analyzing rural livelihoods in terms of their sustainability and their implications for rural poverty. The framework argues that our analyses of rural livelihoods need to understand them in terms of: (a) people's access to five types of capital asset; (b) the ways in which they combine and transform those al;sets in the building of livelihoods that as far as possible meet their material and their experiential needs; (c) the ways in which people are able to expand their asset bases through engaging with other actors through relationships governed by the logics of the state, market and civil society; and (d) the ways in which they are able to deploy and enhance their capabilities both to make living more meaningful and to change the dominant rules and relationships governing the ways in which resources are controlled, distributed and transformed in society. Particular attention is paid to the importance of social capital as an asset through which people are able to widen their access to resources and other actors. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

ID GLYPHOSATE
AB In Germany, no gemetically modified (GM) varieties are available for cultivation. In 1999 26 varieties with different GM properties of four crops are in vcu-tests (value of cultivation and use) for registration by the Bundessortenamt. These varieties could be grown on a large scale at the earliest form 2000 to 2002. Seed can also be purchased from varieties listed in the EEC variety catalogue. Whether or not and when the first GM varieties will be listed is currently unknown. One prerequisite for registration of GM varieties is marketing authorization by the EU Commission. Depending on this authorization and the German seed act, only insect resistant (Bt(-)) and herbicide tolerant maize can be grown on a limited area in Germany today.
   The introduction of GM herbicide tolerant sugar beet varieties could be an approach to sustainable sugar belt cultivation. Relating to the mode of action of both Liberty and Roundup Ultra, weed control with concepts of economic thresholds could be developed. Furthermore, both herbicides have a low toxicity and are metabolized fast and without residues in the soil.
   In Germany, public acceptance is increasing while more and more doubts are bring raised in other EU member states. It can be assumed that the political situation in Europe will lead to delays in the registration and market release of GM varieties in Germany.

AB The ability to model the suspended sediment flux (SSflux) and associated water flow from terrain affected by selective logging is important to the establishment of credible measures to improve the ecological sustainability of forestry practices. Recent appreciation of the impact of parameter uncertainty on the statistical credibility of complex models with little internal state validation supports the use of more parsimonious approaches such as data-based mechanistic (DBM) modelling. The DBM approach combines physically based understanding with model structure identification based on transfer functions and objective statistical inference. Within this study, these approaches have been newly applied to rainfall-SSflux response. The dynamics of the sediment system, together with the rainfall-river flow system, were monitored at five nested contributory areas within a 44 ha headwater region in Malaysian Borneo. The data series analysed covered a whole year at a 5 min resolution, and were collected during a period some five to six years after selective timber harvesting had ceased. Physically based and statistical interpretation of these data was possible given the wealth of contemporary and past hydrogeomorphic data collected within the same region.
   The results indicated that parsimonious, three-parameter models of rainfall-river flow and rainfall-SSflux for the whole catchment describe 80 and 90% of the variance, respectively, and that parameter changes between scales could be explained in physically meaningful terms. Indeed, the modelling indicated some new conceptual descriptions of the river flow and sediment-generation systems. An extreme rainstorm having a 10-20 year return period was present within the data series and was shown to generate new mass movements along the forestry roads that had a differential impact on the monitored contributory areas. Critically, this spatially discrete behaviour was captured by the modelling and may indicate the potential use of DBM approaches for (i) predicting the differential effect of alternative forestry practices, (ii) estimating uncertainty in the behaviour of ungauged areas and (iii) forecasting river flow and SSflux in terrain with temporal changes in rainfall regime and forestry impacts.

AB The visual uniformity of tropical peat swamp forest masks the considerable variation in forest structure that has evolved in response to differences and changes in peat characteristics over many millennia. Details are presented of forest structure and tree composition of the principal peat swamp forest types in the upper catchment of Sungai Sebangau, Central Kalimantan, Indonesia, in relation to thickness and hydrology of the peat. Consideration is given to data on peat geochemistry and age of peat that provide evidence of the ombrotrophic nature of this Vast peatland and its mode of formation. The future sustainability of this ecosystem is predicted from information available on climate change and human impact in this region.

ID FLUORIDE INGESTION; SKELETAL FLUOROSIS; MANIFESTATIONS
AB India is among the 23 nations around the globe, where health problems occur due to the consumption of fluoride contaminated water. An estimated 62 million people in India in 17 out of the 32 states are affected with dental, skeletal and/or non-skeletal fluorosis. The extent of fluoride contamination of water varies from 1.0 to 48.0 mg/l.
   An innovative approach developed for fluorosis mitigation is reported. Networking between Public Health Engineering and Health Sector personnel. well-defined objectives for provision of safe/defluoridated water; improvement in the health status of the community through nutritional intervention are the highlights of the programme. Modules for use in out-patient departments for early and correct diagnosis of fluorosis have been developed The need for teaching about fluorosis in medical colleges is emphasized. Early detection of the disease is the crux of the problem.
   In the Fluorosis Management Programme, the major thrust is on (i) awareness generation, iii) opting technology for fluoride removal/strategy for providing safe water on a sustainable basis, and (iii) emphasis on importance of consuming calcium, vitamin C, E and antioxidant-rich diet for minimizing the adverse effects of fluoride.

AB When a physical mixture composed of a 0.7 wt.% PtSn-ZSM-5 dehydrogenation (DH) catalyst and a 42 wt.% Bi2O3/SiO2 selective hydrogen combustion (SHC) catalyst is subjected to a DH + SHC redox process operation, it gives substantially higher than equilibrium propylene yields from propane. At 540 degrees C, atmospheric pressure and WHSV of 2 h(-1), initial microreactor propylene yields from neat propane are 48.2% at about 90% selectivity, compared to equilibrium olefin yields of 20.0% at about 95% selectivity when only the DH catalyst is used. The overall propylene yield improvement is 140%. In this novel redox process arrangement no gaseous oxygen is cofed to the physical mixture; the lattice oxygen of the SHC catalyst is the sole oxidizing agent to selectively combust the hydrogen produced in situ by the dehydrogenation of the propane, catalyzed by the commingled DH catalyst. Periodic regeneration with air is necessary to replenish the lattice oxygen of the SHC catalyst depleted in the redox reaction.
   Although still significantly (i.e., 65%) above equlibrium, the high initial DH + SHC propylene yields are not sustainable and decline from 48.2% (first cycle) to 33.0% (tenth cycle); i.e., 2.1%/cycle; they are ascribed to the loss of Bi2O3 dispersion on the SiO2 support caused by the deep redox cycling. Shortening the redox cycle or increasing the SHC/DH catalyst ratio lessen the decline. However, the identification of a more redox stable catalyst is imperative to make the process practical. Some suggestions are provided. It is surmised that the DH + SHC redox process approach will ultimately (i.e., once a sufficiently redox stable SHC catalyst is identified) be preferred over the DH- > SHC- > DH cofed approach to improve conventional dehydrogenation processes such as the Oleflex and Catofin processes.

AB Macroscopic charcoal and pollen analysis were used to study the disturbance history and development of a boreal Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karat.) forest landscape in southeastern Norway. The sites studied were natural forests and the charcoal records showed no evidence of fire disturbance that could have broken the continuity in the spruce forests that were established ca. 1700 years ago. Consequently, true spruce forest ecosystem continuity was documented on a landscape level. However, fire disturbed the mixed pine-deciduous forest ecosystems that preceded the present spruce forests, suggesting a shift from fire-prone, to fire-free forest ecosystems.
   It is argued that the studied forest landscape has the potential to be an important natural reference for future forestry, that would be required to mimic natural forest dynamics to be biologically sustainable. A stereotypic promiscuous use of fire in the regeneration phase may cause serious damages in forest ecosystems that have developed without the impact of fire disturbance.

AB Resting or basal metabolic rates, compared across a wide range of organisms, scale with respect to body mass as approximately the 0.75 power. This relationship has recently been linked to the fractal geometry of the appropriate transport system or, in the case of birds and mammals, the blood vascular system. However, the structural features of the blood vascular system should more closely reflect maximal aerobic metabolic rates rather than submaximal function. Thus, the maximal aerobic metabolic rates of birds and mammals should also scale as approximately the 0.75 power. A review of the literature on maximal oxygen consumption and factorial aerobic scope (maximum oxygen consumption divided by basal metabolic rate) suggests that body mass influences the capacity of the cardiovascular system to raise metabolic rates above those at rest. The results show that the maximum sustainable metabolic rates of both birds and mammals are similar and scale as approximately the 0.88 +/- 0.02 power of body mass (and aerobic scope as approximately the 0.15 +/- 0.05 power), when the measurements are standardized with respect to the differences in relative heart mass and haemoglobin concentration between species. The maximum heart beat frequency of birds and mammals is predicted to scale as the - 0.12 +/- 0.02 power of body mass, while that at rest should scale as - 0.27 +/- 0.04.

AB Compounds with strong thermodynamic affinity for carbon dioxide (CO2) have been designed and synthesized that dissolve in CO2, then associate to form gels. Upon removal of the CO2, these gels produced free-standing foams with cells with an average diameter smaller than 1 micrometer and a bulk density reduction of 97 percent relative to the parent material.

TI Energetic constraints on the diet of terrestrial carnivores
SO NATURE
LA English
DT Article
ID CONSUMPTION
AB Species in the mammalian order Carnivora exhibit a huge diversity of life histories with body sizes spanning more than three orders of magnitude. Despite this diversity, most terrestrial carnivores can be classified as either feeding on invertebrates and small vertebrates or on large vertebrates. Small carnivores feed predominantly on invertebrates probably because they are a superabundant: resource (sometimes 90% of animal biomass(1-3)); however, intake rates of invertebrate feeders are low, about one tenth of those of vertebrate feeders(4,5). Although small carnivores can subsist on this diet because of low absolute energy requirements, invertebrate feeding appears to be unsustainable for larger carnivores. Here we show, by reviewing the most common live prey in carnivore diets, that there is a striking transition from feeding on small prey (less than half of predator mass) to large prey (near predator mass), occurring at predator masses of 21.5-25kg. We test the hypothesis that this dichotomy is the consequence of mass-related energetic requirements and we determine the predicted maximum mass that an invertebrate diet can sustain. Using a simple energetic model and known invertebrate intake rates, we predict a maximum sustainable mass of 21.5 kg, which matches the point where predators shift from small to large prey.

AB Objective: Few studies have described levels and determinants of perceived risk of HIV-1 among African adults for whom the sere-status is known. This study describes HIV risk perception obtained from a large rural population in south-west Uganda which also underwent serological testing for HIV.
   Design: Cross-sectional survey.
   Methods: Information on risk perception and sexual behaviour was collected by interview. Sera were obtained from all consenting adults (13 years and above) in order to assess HIV-1 prevalence.
   Results: Of 14 818 adults with a definitive sere-status, 9.7% were HIV-1 positive and 51% considered themselves to be at risk of infection. Risk perception showed similar patterns as age- and sex-specific sere-prevalence and there was correspondence between risk factors for perceived risk and known HIV risk factors. Partner's sexual behaviour was the commonest reason for risk perception in women whereas men cited their own sexual behaviour. Abstinence from sex was much more commonly mentioned as a protective practice than condom use in men and women.
   Conclusion: Half of the adults we have studied already see infection with HIV as a real possibility in their lives and are aware of HIV risk behaviours. More efforts should be made to implement sustainable control measures rather than simply raising awareness. In addition to recommending abstinence, these include mutual faithfulness, condom use and better treatment for STDs. (C) 1999 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

ID MICHIGAN; REGENERATION
AB Overbrowsing by white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) has created difficulties in regenerating northern white-cedar (Thuja occidentalis L.) in Michigan during the last 30 years. This has prompted concerns among resource managers regarding the long-term sustainability of cedar forests. After reviewing many areas, we identified three that were strip clearcut 20-30 years ago and had successfully regenerated. We determined patterns of species establishment and height growth and computed the time interval over which this cedar was vulnerable to browsing by deer. Cedar comprised 51-82% of all trees and 36-70% of overstory trees in the three study areas. Balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.), black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P.), and white spruce (P. glauca (Moench) Voss) were important associates. Seedling establishment in these stands had continued for up to 20 years after clearcutting. However, all overstory trees were derived from advance regeneration or from seedlings that established within the first 10 years after cutting. Seedlings that established early but were overtopped by faster growing trees, or seedlings that established later than 10 years after cutting, were restricted to understory positions. It took 23-26 years after logging for two of our study sites to become fully stocked with cedar that were tall enough to escape overbrowsing by deer. The third area had no trees of this size, even after 20 years. Cedar's successful regeneration on these strip clearcuts can be attributed to its aggressive colonization, the lack of faster-growing competitors, and Limited herbivory over several decades. Extending this experience to other areas, where strip clearcutting has failed, will require an unprecedented, steadfast management policy. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Economic growth may protect the environment in the long run, but causes environmental degradation in the economic take-off stage. Two types of measures need to be introduced in the short run to minimise environmental degradation and realise sustainable development: economic instrument and government, regulation. China has endeavoured to introduce and implement environmental legislation and management with some success. However, the introduction of economic instruments can only be effective in the context of a perfect market system and legal framework. Although China's market-oriented reforms have made good progress, there are as yet many imperfections.

AB The history of the development of agriculture during the last half-century highlights that crop protection plays a leading role. Pesticides provided ideal conditions for other agricultural development factors in order to increase yields and improving product quality. They have proved to be the favourite tool for protecting crops. Plant protection methods become much more respectful of environmental concerns, involving a move towards diversified, integrated solutions. This paper provides a review of the major discoveries in terms of crop protection products and compiles the professional institutions. It reports also on the different problems encountered, poisoning of non-target plants, environmental harm and resistance of harmful organisms.

TI Response of overseeded alfalfa and bermudagrass to alfalfa row spacing
   and nitrogen rate
SO AGRONOMY JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
ID BOTANICAL COMPOSITION; SOIL; YIELD
AB Alfalfa (Medicago sativa L,) is a rare forage crop on Coastal Plain soils. Acid soils, wet conditions, and the prevalence of perennial, warm-season grasses limit alfalfa production. Development of grazing-tolerant varieties raised interest in growing alfalfa on the Coastal Plain. This three-year dryland field study was conducted to evaluate coincident production of 'Alfagraze' alfalfa and 'Coastal' bermudagrass [Cynodon dactylon (L,) Pers,] as a sustainable forage system. Limestone (effective calcium carbonate equivalence ECCE 72%) at a rate of 6.1 t ha(-1) was incorporated by roto-tilling 15 cm deep in an established sod of Coastal bermudagrass on a Darco loamy fine sand (loamy, siliceous, thermic Grossarenic Paleudults) in late winter 1990, with an additional 3 t ha(-1) surface-applied in June 1991. Alfalfa was seeded in October 1990 at 23, Ib, 69, and 92 cm between rows in main plots of a split-plot design Nitrogen rates from 0 to 112 kg ha(-1) in increments of 28 kg ha(-1) were applied to subplots for every bermudagrass regrowth cycle. Other plant nutrients (including P, K, Mg, S, B, Zn, and Cu),were applied at rates considered adequate for alfalfa on a low-fertility soil. Yield of alfalfa at the 23-cm row sparing in 1991 was 8.8 t ha(-1) and declined to 6.7 t ha(-1) at 69 cm (P = 0.05), while yield of bermudagrass increased from 3.2 to 5.7 t ha(-1), respectively, at these row spacings, In 1992, alfalfa yield increased an additional 2.2 t ha(-1) at each row spacing, with a compensating decline in bermudagrass production. Alfalfa yielded 11 t ha(-1) at all row spacings in 1993, despite a midseason drought, while bermudagrass yield was <450 kg ha(-1). Row spacing had no effect on total forage production in an. year. Higher N rates increased bermudagrass yield the first two years,Applied N increased alfalfa yield at certain harvests, but had no effect on total annual production. Crude protein in alfalfa declined or remained similar as row spacing was widened Soil pH was lowered by increasing N rates and hg narrower alfalfa ron spacings. Results indicate that alfalfa competes well with Coastal bermudagrass, even in drought conditions.

AB The global relation of wood production and consumption is examined, with emphasis on wood as an energy source. In many regions of the world, particularly in the developing countries, the demand for fuelwood can only be supplied by overexploitation of forest land. Our calculations are based on published data from various sources, which are combined with model applications. Results are prognoses in the form of global maps by countries. They show that the deficiency of fuelwood will become more critical in large areas of the world, particularly in developing countries with a rapid population growth. This development bears the risk of continuing deforestation and is a threat to sustainable land use. Transition to renewable energy sources (hydropower, solar, wind, geothermal as well as biofuels), produced in a sustainable manner, seems to be the only way out of this dilemma.

AB Sustainable development is an intergeneration concept. It cannot be achieved without far-reaching visions, nor without specific knowledge, solutions, and actions. The academic world is witnessing strong tendencies of specialization and fragmentation; whereas the challenges to policy making lie in integration, interdisciplinarity, and broadness. From a narrow standpoint, many things appear "linear", with straightforward, one-directional causal relationships. In reality, however, they constitute complex interconnected networks with many feedbacks and cycles. A broad view is necessary when identifying such interconnections. The challenges to water-resources development in most parts of the world are increasing. Besides present tasks, the sector professionals should be encouraged to broaden their expertise from fragmented, highly specialized approaches to integrated, multidisciplinary ones.

TI The plateau pika (Ochotona curzoniae) is a keystone species for
   biodiversity on the Tibetan plateau
SO ANIMAL CONSERVATION
LA English
DT Article
AB It is necessary to look at the big picture when managing biological resources on the Qinghai-Xizang (Tibetan) plateau. Plateau pikas (Ochotona curzoniae) are poisoned widely across the plateau. Putative reasons for these control measures are that pika populations may reach high densities and correspondingly reduce forage for domestic livestock (yak, sheep, horses), and because they may be responsible for habitat degradation. In contrast, we highlight the important role the plateau pika plays as a keystone species in the Tibetan plateau ecosystem. The plateau pika is a keystone species because it: (i) makes burrows that are the primary homes to a wide variety of small birds and lizards; (ii) creates microhabitat disturbance that results in an increase in plant species richness; (iii) serves as the principal prey for nearly all of the plateau's predator species; (iv) contributes positively to ecosystem-level dynamics. The plateau pika should be managed in concert with other uses of the land to ensure preservation of China's native biodiversity, as well as long-term sustainable use of the pastureland by domestic livestock.

AB Listening in on the easy private banter of scientists, one hears deprecation of the politicians who run this world and wishful claims for the rationality of science. If only the scientific approach were applied to the way countries are governed, it is supposed, the world's problems would vanish.... Confused, even hurt, by the complexity of the world they live in, scientists reach naively for the dream that the wild universe of emotions and collective actions is governed by some rational principles, still to be discovered (Hoffman, 1990).

TI Preventing deadly conflict - The critical role of leadership
SO ARCHIVES OF GENERAL PSYCHIATRY
LA English
DT Article
AB This article emerged from the work of the Carnegie Commission on Preventing Deadly Conflict, Washington, DC. The commission addressed several fundamental questions: (1) What are the problems posed by deadly conflict, and why is outside help often necessary to deal with these problems? (2) How can disputes be resolved peaceably! (3) Which strategies work best! (4) Who can do what to implement these preventive strategies! Borrowing from the model of preventive medicine, the commission detailed a repertoire of the most promising political, economic, military, and social tools and strategies that can be mobilized by the international community to assist vulnerable societies in the development of sustainable and equitable arrangements for managing diversity and resolving disputes peacefully. From a comparative examination of intransigent and destructive intergroup conflicts, the commission found that the failure to prevent conflict is most often not a failure of foreknowledge or capacity but of political will. Effective political leadership is often the critical variable for successful prevention. This article seeks to illustrate how the social and behavioral sciences may be usefully ap plied to the problems encountered by leaders when confronted by the challenges of preventing deadly conflict.

TI Animals as erosion agents in the alpine zone: Some data and observations

SO ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article

AB Animals can exert a very strong impact on erosion and sediment transport in the alpine. Although the alpine is recognized for its abundance of animals, animal-soil erosion interactions have been poorly studied. Animals exert a direct influence through their burrowing and digging for food and also indirectly by opening the ground to climatic and geomorphic influences, e.g. rain splash, needle ice, and wind erosion. It is this synergy that is important for alpine erosion. Because the alpine zone is subject to freezing, frost action, and snow melt, exposed sediments and/or the availability of drainage through burrows can have a marked effect on sediment transport and slopes. On the steeper, less stable alpine slopes, the effects of loading can cause failure that produces arcuate slip scars, the exposed faces of which can also be exploited by geomorphic processes. In an attempt to study the effect of animals in the alpine zone, measurements of burrowing and digging based on quadrats (5 m x 5 m) along several transects were made in the alpine zone of the Rocky Mountains of Canada. Results indicated an average of 0.0243 m(3) 25 m(-2) sediment displaced due to digging by rodents and a conservative estimation of sediment removal by rodents varying between 600 and 0.6408 m(3) km(-2) yr(-1). Grizzly bears exerted the greatest erosional impact with as much as 0.4958 m(3) 25 m(-2) being measured. Observations (and limited measurements) relating to the impact of animals on the landscape were also obtained from Lesotho and Tibet. These preliminary findings are presented in an attempt to exemplify the various and interrelated effects of animals, climate and geomorphic process for the alpine. It is suggested that significantly more studies are urgently needed as the situation may be exacerbated by climatic warming and/or by the expansion of pastoralism resulting from attempts at sustainable development in developing nations. The impact of animals is an unquantified factor in many development studies, in geomorphic studies in polar or high altitude environments, and in management plans for national parks or the exploitation of natural resources (e.g. through logging).

ID EXCRETA
AB Modern livestock production facilities Face bath challenges and opportunities with respect to sustainable manure management practices. Nutrient recycling is constrained by the size of modem livestock operations, the low nutrient density of liquid manures, and the spatial and temporal variability of manure nutrient concentrations. These constraints can and must be addressed or farmers will be increasingly drawn to nutrient wasting strategies such as anaerobic lagoons, wetlands, and other systems designed to treat and discharge nutrients to the environment, intentional discharge of nutrients is difficult to justify in a sustainable agricultural production system, since replacing those nutrients through chemical fertilization requires considerable expenditure of energy. In contrast, there are several currently viable technologies which provide the homogenization and stabilization needed to successfully compete against chemical fertilizers, including composting, pelletization, and anaerobic digestion. Some of these technologies, particularly anaerobic digestion and composting, also open up increased opportunities to market the energy and nutrients in manure to non-agricultural uses. Future advances in biotechnology are likely to demonstrate additional options to transform manure into fuels, chemicals, and other non-agricultural products.

AB CIB's efforts to create an Agenda 21 for the construction sector are introduced here. CIB's unique position within the international construction community allowed it to initiate a specific sectorial response to the international agendas raised by Brundtland, Habitat II, Rio and Kyoto. CIB's recognition of the problems in establishing both a framework for sustainable development; how change within industry occurs, along with CIB's past, current and proposed activities meant that CIB was perfectly suited to respond to sustainable development. This GIB-led project resulted in global collaboration and co-ordination to specifically address sustainable development for the construction community. Situated between the broad international agendas and more local and subsectorial agendas, CIB's Agenda 21 is a conceptual framework that serves as an intermediary and provides for comparison and co-ordination. The three principal objectives are: to create a global framework and terminology that will add value to national, regional and sub-sectorial agendas; to create an agenda for CIB activities and for co-ordinating CIB with specialist partner organizations, and to provide a source document for definition of R&D activities.

AB Encouragement of innovation is a major reason for using the performance concept in construction regulations and specifications, mostly in the context of design-build contracts. Performance criteria aiming at sustainability emphasize long term behaviour of built facilities, which complicates the measurement of compliance. Strategies for identifying areas with strong promises of innovative technologies should be developed, so as to concentrate the efforts in developing performance requirements. The development of standardized consensus methods and procedures should be accelerated. Finally, it is suggested that good examples of how performance requirements can be expressed and monitored should be made globally available.

AB The international construction community's understanding of sustainable development is compromised by a systemic communication gap between the developed and developing worlds as well as a failure to address the implications of social requirements. The inclusion of the developing world within the sustainable development debate is argued as essential and the obstacles to achieving this are considered. Initiating a real dialogue in an equal partnership between the developed and developing worlds is a key challenge to define the process, guidelines and achieve protocols for sustainable development. Although CIB has recently commenced engaging with the developing world, much more needs to be done.

AB This payer provides an introduction to some of the key issues relating to the context of sustainability. It argues for a more holistic approach to sustainability built around a consensus of an agreed definition and a philosophical framework to allow a meaningful discussion to take place, leading to improved decision making. It recognizes that at this emerging stage of the topic, even these matters are research issues and that in parallel with this debate it is important that progress at the subproblem level must continue. The paper points out the issues as a means of providing context for many of the papers in these proceedings.

A number of issues were identified as impacting on procurement: ethical and human rights, higher environmental standards, eco-design principles, life cycle implications and performance specification, understanding clients' cultural values. Alternative procurement strategies will be required to incorporate sustainability issues. The impact of environmental and sustainability issues on liability presents increased risks and this results in new forms of insurance coverage for all environmental risks.

AB This paper, updated from a speech delivered to the CIB World Congress on 12 June 1998 at Gavle, Sweden, outlines recent and proposed developments by the UK government on its approach to sustainable development in construction. A wide definition of sustainability includes social progress, environmental protection, prudent use of natural resources and economic growth/stable levels of employment. A wide array of measures have been or will be implemented: an integrated national transport policy, a national programme of CO2 reductions from new (and possibly existing) buildings, a Social Exclusion Unit, a Welfare to Work programme, demonstration projects of sustainable construction, a new sustainable development strategy, dialogue with the construction industry, waste reduction schemes, landfill and aggregate taxes, improved management of water resources, an emphasis on whole life costs rather than initial capital tests of buildings, the development of sustainability indicators.

AB The harvesting of Ecteinascidia turbinata on a sustainable basis could be an example for the production of metabolites from marine organisms while protecting natural populations. A research program was carried out in order to determine the recovery capacity of an E. turbinata population, after carrying out harvesting experiments in the Carribbean and Mediterranean Sea. In the Mediterranean, 25, 40 and 100% of the population was collected, with two collections for each group at 45 and 60 d. There was complete recovery of the biomass in the 25 and 40% collections after 45 d,but in the 100% collections only 62% of the biomass had recovered after 60 d. In the Caribbean, 25, 50, 75%, and later 100%, collections were carried out. After 16 d there was a recovery of the density of the population but not of the biomass. After 3 mo there was a recovery of density, biomass and root coverage in the 100% collection.

AB Four groups of juvenile Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) were collected in summer (1992) from four coastal sites of northeast Newfoundland. They were held together at seasonally ambient temperature and photoperiod and monitored over one winter for variation in a biochemical phenotype, antifreeze production capacity. Our results show that population differences in antifreeze production capacity reflect the severity of overwintering conditions faced. Cod from three bays along the northeast coast (49 degrees 30'-47 degrees 30' N) exhibited very similar patterns of antifreeze production, suggesting that these environments demand from their cod inhabitants approximately the same high level of freeze resistance. However, cod from the most exposed northerly site at the tip of the Great Northern Peninsula (51 degrees 30' N) developed antifreeze levels about 50% higher than those of the other three groups, confirming that the more extreme high-latitude environment demands even greater freeze protection for survival. Since 34% of Great Northern Peninsula cod produced antifreeze levels outside the range of all other juveniles, we suggest that the physiological distinctness of this population has evolved by genetic amplification of antifreeze production capacity rather than by selective mortality. The existence of physiological population structure should be factored into strategies for sustainable fishing of this species in northern waters.

The integration of common concepts, processes and methodologies from the area of public health and social impact assessment challenges the quantitative model approach to risk assessment. The expert-driven risk assessment is transformed into a social learning process where local knowledge and scientific input foster a dialogue among stakeholders. The issue-oriented, iterative and participative assessment process may be applied to the health impact assessment of public policies. Sustainable development with its social objectives of empowerment, participation, equity, poverty alleviation, social cohesion, population stability and institutional development is an appropriate framework for conducting health impact assessments.

AB The long-term health of the population will be influenced by a number of major forces in the next century. In this brief review, particular emphasis is placed on environmental and economic forces. Major global environmental changes include climate change and global warming, resource depletion, ecotoxicity and reduced biodiversity. We do not yet know the impact on longevity of lifetime exposure to a mix of persistent toxic chemicals in our environment, since it has only been widespread in the past 40-50 years. The health impacts of global warming are only just beginning to be understood and could be profound. But perhaps the most profound threat to population health is economic growth, to the extent that it undermines environmental and social sustainability. We need new a form of capitalism, one that simultaneously increases environmental, social, economic and human capital, if population health is to be maintained in the 21st century.

AB To maintain a sustainable agricultural system, management practices such as grazing must ensure adequate soil water for plant growth, yet minimize the risk of soil erosion. The objective of this study was to characterize the soil water regime of perennial and annual forages under three grazing intensities (heavy, medium and light). The study was conducted at the Lacombe Research Station, Alberta, on an Orthic Black Chemozem of loam to silt loam texture. The forages used were smooth bromegrass (Bromus inermis L. 'Carlton'), meadow bromegrass (Bromus ripanius L. 'Paddock'), a mixture of triticale (X Triticosecale Wittmack 'Pika') and barley (Hordeum vulgare L. 'AC Lacombe') and triticale. Soil water measurements were conducted between April and October of 1994 and 1995 using a neutron scattering hydroprobe to a depth of 90 cm. Surface (0-7.5 cm) soil water was more responsive to grazing intensity than soil water accumulated to various depths. For all grazing treatments and forages, both surface soil water and accumulated soil water generally fluctuated between field capacity and wilting point during the growing season. Although plant water status was not determined, no visual permanent wilting of forages was observed during the study. Differences in evapotranspiration (ET), as determined by differences in soil water were evident among forage species but not grazing intensities, with perennials having high ET in spring and annuals having high ET in summer. Estimated values of water-use efficiency (WUE) were greater for perennials than for annuals and grazing effects on WUE were minimal. From a management perspective, grazing of annuals and perennials altered soil water dynamics but still maintained adequate soil water for plant growth.

AB In a retrospective view the period of the International Conferences on Circulating Fluidized Beds against the background of emerging demands in energy and raw materials supply is outlined. Growing world population and sustainable development call for efficient and economic processes preferably with the highest possible integrated pollution control. Gas-solid reactors for fine particles such as CFB-risers and downers increasingly compete with long established reaction systems and gain increasing acceptance in manifold new processing route. They allow not only for clean electricity from low-grade coal but also to supply raw materials to different processing industries with less environmental burdens in an even economic way. New CFB-processing routes will be explained with examples from utility, cement, steel and petrochemical industries. CFB research and development have to concentrate upon risers and downers as well, as single units or integrated into a processing system. The resulting systems approach in CFB development requires the optimal use of innovative basic research results from different professional disciplines in university and industry and the cooperation between users and plant constructors as well.

AB Several techniques are used to estimate whether investing in vaccines and immunization is worthwhile, including cost analysis, cost-benefit analysis, cost-effectiveness analysis, and cost-utility analysis. At least 162 published economic evaluations of vaccines have been carried out from 1969 to 1998. They consistently show that immunization is an excellent investment - highly cost-effective and usually cost-saving - for vaccines that are currently recommended for universal use. Although prices of newer vaccines are higher than prices of traditional vaccines, they are still highly cost-effective. The World Health Organization, UNICEF, and vaccine manufacturers have developed approaches to make newer vaccines available to developing countries at reduced prices. Sustainability of immunization programs (the ability of a country to continue its immunization program in the absence of external support) is an increasingly important goal. However, external assistance will be essential in the short term to ensure that all the world's people benefit fully from the new vaccines.

AB Knowledge centric activities of developing new products and services are becoming the primary source of sustainable competitive advantage in an era characterized by short product life cycles, dynamic markets and complex processes. We view new product development (NPD) as a knowledge-intensive activity. Based on a case study in the consumer electronics industry, we identify problems associated with knowledge management (KM) in the context of NPD by cross-functional collaborative teams. We map these problems to broad Information Technology enabled solutions and subsequently translate these into specific system characteristics and requirements, A prototype system that meets these requirements developed to capture and manage tacit and explicit process knowledge is further discussed. The functionalities of the system include functions for representing context with informal components, easy access to process knowledge, assumption surfacing, review of past knowledge, and management of dependencies. We demonstrate the validity our proposed solutions using scenarios drawn from our case study. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The severity of water problems in Jordan was realized at the beginning of the 1980s. Many strategies and measures were proposed to alleviate and overcome these problems. These mainly include supply augmentation measures through constructing various hydraulic structures and groundwater exploitation. In addressing supply management, it was concluded that no single action could remedy the nation's water shortage. Rather, many integrated actions are needed to ensure water availability, suitability, and sustainability. Among those options, the development of new water resources such as brackish water were identified as a potential source for supply augmentation.

AB lThe proposed EIA procedure follows a minimal guideline which consists of 1) analysis of the source of impacts, 2) analysis of the impacted ecosystem, 3) definition of the links between source and targets, 4) recommendation of mitigation measures and 5) sustainability of the environmental protection measures. For step 1. the focus is on the components of the discharges into the sea where ten groups of environmentally critical substance groups are discussed. For step 2, it is pointed to an earlier subdivision of the corresponding marine ecosystem into subsystems, which are ordered according to sensitivity. Steps 3, 4, and 5 are outlined as far as it is feasible for a general treatise, which is independent of a distinct plant or region. The final claim is for the persecution and publication of serious EIA's to provide methodical and exemplary cases.

AB The paper presents an attempt to assess sustainability of desalination plants for water production based on resource, environmental and economic indicators. Four types of desalination plants are taken into a consideration: single MSF, dual purpose MSF, RO with local energy consumption and RO with PV electric energy production. The analysis is based on data from desalination plants in Gulf countries. In particular, it reflects water production demand and energy sources used for the individual plants. The decision-making procedure in the sustainability assessment of desalination plants is based on the multi-criteria evaluation under uncertainty of complex systems expressed by the General Sustainability Index. Evaluation of different cases reflecting priority of the criteria for evaluation has led to the selection of options, which are in compliance with respective criteria.

DE ecosystem; management; population; quality; resources; stress; scarcity
AB The increase in population growth all over the world and the sectoral pressures have produced a number of unprecedented demands for water supplies both as consumptive and non-consumptive uses. These stresses have caused a reduction in the per capita usage of the limited fresh water resources in many countries to a scarcity level. They have also resulted in the degradation of the quality of water in large areas of the world. The overall objective for water management, which adopts integrated approaches, is to satisfy the freshwater needs of all countries for their sustainable development. Integrated water resources management is based on the perception of water as an integral part of the ecosystem, a natural resource and a social and economic good, whose quantity and quality determine the nature of its utilization. The integration approach has to incorporate policy options that recognize these elements, develop national water policies and to base the demand for and allocation of water resources on equity and efficient use. An integrated water resources management (IWRM), if implemented, must consider the strengthening of human resources development in terms of awareness creation programs, training of water managers, the development of new institutions that will serve and match this goal, effective information management, environment and development, the integration of water planning into national economy and financing and scientific means. This paper will discuss the various water problems viz. (a) increasing water shortages, (b) deteriorating water quality and (c) stresses on water supplies and the challenges they represent to integrating the approaches of water management to ensure sustainability of the resource.

AB Numerous pilot plant studies and commercial facilities operating all over the world have demonstrated the technical and economic feasibility of reclaiming municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) effluent through dual-membrane treatment processes. Dual-membrane processes such as continuous microfiltration (CMF) followed by reverse osmosis (RO) are used to produce water that meets all drinking water standards. Pilot plant studies conducted in Gran Canaria (Canary Islands) at the former DEREA Center, treating the effluent from the EDAR del Sureste using CMF followed by RO or electrodialysis reversal (EDR), clearly demonstrated the high quality of the treated water. Commercial facilities producing water for irrigation, for industrial use, to recharge aquifers, or as a source for indirect potable water reuse systems are already operating at these locations: Waster Factory 21, California; West Basin Water District at El Segundo, California; Samsung General Chemicals Co., Ltd., at Daesan, Republic of Korea; Vertesi Power Plant Co., at Oroszlany, Hungary; EDAR de Tias, at Lanzarote, Canary Islands. By the end of 1999 the Scottsdale Water Campus at Scottsdale, Arizona, will produce reclaimed water for irrigation and for indirect potable water reuse. The advanced wastewater treatment (AWT) facility, using CMF and RO, will have a capacity of 38,000 m(3)/d of product water.

AB Anthropogenic changes in temperature and stream flow, associated with watershed land use and climate change, are critical influences on the distribution and abundance of riverine fishes. To project the effects of changing land use and climate, we modeled a smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu) population in a midwestern USA, large river-floodplain ecosystem under historical (1915-1925), present (1977-1990), and future (2060, influenced by climate change) temperature and flow regimes. The age-structured model included parameters for temperature and river discharge during critical seasonal periods, fish population dynamics, and fishing harvest. Model relationships were developed from empirical field data collected over a 13-yr period. Sensitivity analyses indicated that discharge during the spawning/rearing period had a greater effect on adult density and fishing yield than did spawning/rearing temperature or winter discharge. Simulations for 100 years projected a 139% greater mean fish density under a historical flow regime (64.9 fish/ha) than that estimated for the present (27.1 fish/ha) with a sustainable fishing harvest under both flow regimes. Simulations under future climate-change-induced temperature and flow regimes with present land use projected a 69% decrease in mean fish density (8.5 fish/ha) from present and an unstable population that went extinct during 56% of the simulations. However, when simulated under a future climate-altered temperature and flow regime with historical land use, the population increased by 66% (45.0 fish/ha) from present and sustained a harvest. Our findings suggest that land-use changes may be a greater detriment to riverine fishes than projected climate change and that the combined effects of both factors may lead to local species extinction. However, the negative effects of increased temperature and precipitation associated with future global warming could be mitigated by river channel, floodplain, and watershed restoration.

AB The oceans have long been recognized as one of humanity's most important natural resources. Their vastness has made them appear to be limitless sources of food, transportation, recreation, and awe. The difficulty of fencing and policing them has left them largely as open access resources to be exploited by anyone with the means. However, in recent times we have begun to reach the limits of the oceans and must now begin to utilize and govern them in a more sustainable way. This paper summarizes emerging information on the interrelated ecological, economic, and social importance of the oceans, and on developing institutions for their sustainable governance. In addition to their traditional importance as sources of primary and secondary production, and biodiversiy, the importance of the oceans in global material and energy cycles is now beginning to be better appreciated. Integrated models of the global ocean-atmosphere-terrestrial biosphere system reveal the critical role of the oceans in atmospheric gas and climate regulation, and for water, nutrient, and waste cycling. Recent estimates of the economic value of the marketed and non-marketed ecosystem services of the oceans indicate a huge contribution to human welfare from the functions mentioned above plus raw materials, recreational, and cultural services. The oceans have been estimated to contribute a total of similar to 21 trillion US$/year to human welfare (compared with a global GNP of similar to 25 trillion US$), with similar to 60% of this from coastal and shelf systems and the other 40% from the open ocean. and with the oceans contributing similar to 60% of the total economic value of the biosphere (Costanza et al., 1997. The value of the world's ecosystem services and natural capital. Nature 387, 253-260). The social importance of the oceans for global transportation and as a unifying element in the cultures of many coastal countries cannot be overestimated. However, the cultural traditions of open access must be replaced with more appropriate property rights regimes and governance structures. Some alternative sustainable governance ideas are briefly discussed, emphasizing the need for an expanded deliberative process to develop a shared vision of a sustainable use of oceans.

AB We develop an interactive simulation model that links ecological and economic systems, and explore the dynamics of harvest patterns as they simultaneously affect natural and human capital. Our models represent both single and multiple systems. The level of natural capital is influenced by interactions of (1) natural capital growth and (non-human influenced) depletion, (2) ecological fluctuations, (3) harvest rules, and (4) biological transfers from one ecological system to another. We focus first on isolated systems in which there are no biological transfers between units and humans rely for subsistence on the resource; thus both the economic and ecological portions of the system are relatively independent of other systems. In this case, the maximum sustainable harvest rate depends on the local carrying capacity, the stock growth rate, and fluctuations in such ecological variables as rainfall and temperature, which are 'extrinsic' to the stock-human harvest, but nonetheless affect stock levels. Next, we address spatially complex situations in which biological resources move from one spatial unit to others. In these models, the greater the potential movement of stocks across ecosystems, the more any particular human sub-system can increase its harvesting rate without danger of its own collapse - although at a cost to neighboring subsystems.

AB The Lisbon principles for sustainable governance of the oceans enunciate some general guidelines for development and implementation of policies to protect ocean resources and ecosystems. By examining issues of diversity in institutional management of uncertainty and coordination of diverse actors, this paper begins to develop a social map of systematic differences in the ways institutions may interpret the principles at various scales of governance from local to global. The paper concludes that institutional diversity in a framework of civil society will prove as important as biodiversity for the sustainability of the oceans. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Governance of the world's marine fisheries is ill-adapted to sustainability. Twenty years after the expansion of exclusive economic zones over most of the continental shelves, fisheries worldwide face problems of stock depletion, declining yields and increasing conflict. Other human activities in the ocean compound the effect. What is wrong? This paper is about the internal workings of fishery governance and their links to fishery outcomes. The theme of this paper is that there are fundamental weaknesses in the way fishery governance works that contribute to sustainability problems. Basic requirements for healthy ocean fishery governance are not being met because the scope and structure of governance are weak. Although the particular forms of weakness vary with fisheries and with geopolitical regions, the substance of the weakness is common across all regions. What we ask of fishery governance is that it coordinate institutional rules and individual actions by performing certain functions: incorporate multiple objectives representing different types of conservation and use; bring the time horizons of private individuals into line with those of the public; send signals of resource scarcity and enable effective adaptive responses; promote legitimacy by reflecting accepted norms of equity and by controlling harmful opportunism: contain both the level and distribution of transactions costs. Fishery governance is failing to adequately perform these functions as a result of the attributes of management scope and management structure. At both national and international levels, improvement of governance will rest on the adoption of a stable long-term management scope and the construction of flexible management structures.

DE design; input and output; management plan
AB In 1994, the Australian state of New South Wales (NSW) passed legislation to introduce a fishery share system. In some ways it is similar to the 'ITQ', or individual transferable quota, fishery management systems found in New Zealand, Iceland, Australia, Canada and other countries. The focus of the system, however, is on fisheries rather than species. In most of these fisheries, a combination of input and output controls are used. Special design features include allotment of shares in the 'fishery' rather than in quotas, and a structure that forces adaptive resource management. The system is designed to maximise the probability that fishery use will remain both sustainable and consistent with social objectives as they change through time. The system's conceptual framework is of relevance to other fisheries and, also, many other industries that use natural resources.
   Consistent with periodically revised management plans, rights to harvest specific amounts of fish or to use certain classes of boars and gear are issued in proportion to the number of shapes held in each fishery, "fishery" being flexibly defined by region and habitat, with or without further specification by gear-type, species group or single species. The management plan might, for example, specify a relationship between number of shares and size of boat or net. Any quotas are allocated in proportion to the number of shares held. Subject to compliance with periodically reviewed share conditions, rights are perpetual and give each fisher a direct financial interest in the future of the fishery. Shares are mortgageable and fully transferable. Driven by the management plan, structural adjustment is delegated to the market and individual fishers. A dual property-right structure is used to minimise transfer costs encourage self-enforcement and compliance. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Welfare as work? The potential of the UK social economy
SO ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING A
LA English
DT Article
AB The authors provide a critical assessment of the emerging academic and policy consensus over the potential of local social economy initiatives to deliver social and economic regeneration. Drawing on material from 60 case studies in the United Kingdom, they examine three central claims made for the social economy: that it is empowering, economically sustainable, and capable of providing a real alternative to the 'mainstream' public and private sector economies. They argue that the empirical evidence offers only ambiguous support for these claims and that the full potential of the UK social economy is not being realised. They identify several factors currently inhibiting the development of effective local social economy projects in the United Kingdom. They conclude by proposing a range of measures that could remove the financial and practical barriers currently constraining the development of an effective and lasting social economy in the United Kingdom.

DE forest landscape management; holistic approach; spatial structure
ID ECOSYSTEM MANAGEMENT; PACIFIC-NORTHWEST
AB Over the last decade, forest management planning has shifted its focus from a production-oriented approach to an ecosystem-based approach. Forest landscape management has thus emerged as a new challenge to forest managers. In this paper we examine the evolutionary process of forest management leading to landscape management and compares and contrasts its concept and principles to its predecessor, the conventional forest re-source management approach. It explains the conceptual framework, provides the principles and the improvements over conventional management planning, and discusses different design approaches towards the landscape management concept. However. the paper points out that the evolutionary process of forest management provides sustainable healthy forest ecosystems. Smarter use of information technology such as geographic information systems and remote sensing. a comprehensive digital spatial database, better understanding of spatial forest ecosystem dynamics across spatial and temporal scales, effective public involvement, better decision-making tools, and development of workable management strategies towards sustainability are prerequisite to make the realization of holistic management approach on the ground happen.

DE defining sustainability; sustainable communities; pragmatism; adaptive
   management; truth
AB The pragmatic conception of truth, anticipated by Henry David Thoreau and developed by C.S. Peirce and subsequent pragmatists, is proposed as a useful analogy for characterising 'sustainability'. Peirce's definition of 'truth' provides an attractive approach to sustainability because (a) it re-focuses discussions of truth and objectivity from a search for 'correspondence" to an 'external world' (the 'conform' approach) to a more forward-looking ('transform') approach; and (b) it emphasises the crucial role of an evolving, questioning community in the conduct of inquiry. Any successful definition of sustainability must share these characteristics with Peircean truth. While Peirce and John Dewey never reconciled their disagreements regarding the nature and task of 'inquiry', a pragmatist resolution of their differences is offered, arguing that we need both a logic;of management sciences (logica utens) and a logic of pure science (logica docens), which (perhaps among other differences) respond very differently to uncertainty. It is shown that adaptive management - an important approach to environmental management - can be understood as a first approximation of a logica utens for social learning in pursuit of solutions to environmental problems, and it is suggested that a pragmatist, transform approach to inquiry such as Dewey's may provide a way around the 'fact-value' gulf.

AB There has been a recent expansion of work within a variety of theoretical frameworks which looks at the role of discourses in policy and politics, much of it focused on environmental issues. Within this there is a particular category-of polemical material which argues for discourse management and for managing discourse between actors towards achieving a particular goal, such as sustainable development. The paper examines the different ways in which the significance of environmental discourse is recognised and its influence analysed. It critically examines the claims made for normative discourse management and highlights the need to consider carefully the institutions through which environmental policy discourse is mediated.

AB Over the past century, Venice Lagoon (Italy) has experienced a high rate of wetland loss. To gain an understanding of the factors leading to this loss, from March 1993 until May 1996 the soil accretionary dynamics of these wetlands were studied. Vertical accretion, short term sedimentation, soil vertical elevation change and horizontal shoreline change were measured at several sites with varying sediment availability and wave energy. Short term sedimentation averaged 3-7 g dry m(-2) day(-1) per site with a maximum of 76 g m(-2) day(-1). The highest values were measured during strong pulsing events, such as storms and river floods, that mobilized and transported suspended sediments. Accretion ranged from 2-23 mm yr(-1) and soil elevation change ranged from -32 to 13.8 mm yr(-1). The sites with highest accretion were near a river mouth and in an area where strong wave energy resuspended bottom sediments that were deposited on the marsh surface. A marsh created with dredged spoil had a high rate of elevation loss, probably due mainly to compaction. Shoreline retreat and expansion of tidal channels also occurred at several sites due to high wave energy and a greater tidal prism. The current rate of elevation gain at some sites was not sufficient to offset relative sea-level rise. The results suggest that reduction of wave energy and increasing sediment availability are needed to offset wetland loss in different areas of the lagoon. Using the data collected as part of this project, we developed a wetland elevation model designed to predict the effect of increasing rates of eustatic sea-level rise on wetland sustainability. The advantage of this model, in conjunction with measured short-term rates of soil elevation change, to determine sustainability is that the model integrates the effects of long term processes (e.g. compaction and decomposition) and rakes into account feedback mechanisms that affect elevation. Specifically, changes in elevation call result in changes in allogenic sediment deposition, decomposition and autogenic primary production. Model results revealed that, given the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 'best estimate' eustatic sea-level rise scenario of 48 cm in the next 100 years, only one site could maintain its elevation relative to sea level over the next century. Under the IPCC 'current conditions' scenario of 15 cm in the next 100 years, four of seven sites remained stable. This work demonstrates that more accurate predictions of the future of coastal wetlands with rising sea level will be obtained with a combination of short-term measurements of accretion and soil elevation change and long-term modelling.

   Bay, Maine
SO ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE

ID MODEL
AB Cobscook Bay is a macrotidal estuary situated near the entrance to the Bay of Fundy, where the mean semi-diurnal tidal range is 5.7 m. Vigorous tidal currents in the bay maintain cold water temperatures year-round and effectively exchange nutrients and other dissolved matter with offshore waters. Partly because of the cold water and tidal exchange, a net-pen salmon aquaculture industry has rapidly expanded in the last decade, raising questions about sustainable levels of production in the environmentally pristine bay. The present study addresses the question of dispersion and flushing of materials in the bay, using a three-dimensional numerical model to simulate the circulation driven by the semi-diurnal tide and runoff from principal rivers. With initialization based on May 1995 cruise data, the results show that the tidal-mean flushing times for neutral surface particles vary from less than one day in the main channel near the entrance to more than a week in the extremities of the inner arms of the bay. A bay-wide average flushing time is about two days, or four tidal cycles, but the detailed distribution is strongly influenced by a pair of counter-rotating eddies that forms in the central bay during each flooding tide. The eddy pattern preferentially directs the initial flood into a southern arm of the bay, where particles and dissolved materials are sequestered. The effective horizontal mixing coefficient in the main channel of the central bay is 300-400 m(2) s(-1), leading to rapid dispersal of particles and pollutants in the along-channel direction and into the shallow inner arms of the bay where they tend to accumulate. A map of tidal-mean residence time indicates that most current aquaculture sites are located in reasonably well flushed regions. (C) 1999 Academic Press.

AB In the Mediterranean zone, efforts to optimize combinations of supplemental irrigation (SI), improved varieties, nitrogen (N) and sowing dates aim to improve and stabilize cereal yields and maintain quality, especially for durum wheat. Thus, a 4 year field study (1992/1993 to 1995/1996) on a deep clay soil in northern Syria assessed the impact of SI (rain-fed, 1/3, 2/3 and full SI) combined with variable N application rates (0, 50, 100, 150 kg ha(-1)) and sowing date (early, normal, late) for four improved durum wheat varieties adapted to rain-fed and irrigated conditions. As rainfall and evapotranspiration varied over the 4 years, the amount of SI water required also varied. Yields varied with the season, and the main factors, except variety, were significant. Delaying sowing from November to January reduced yields and response to both SI and N. With irrigation, crop responses were generally significant up to 100 N ha(-1), whereas the optimum response for rain-fed conditions occurred with 50 kg N ha(-1). Limited SI (1/3) significantly increased yields, but almost maximum yields were obtained by 2/3 of full SI. Water- and N-use efficiencies were greatly increased by SI, with little variation among varieties. However, irrigation and delayed sowing decreased grain protein levels, which were partially compensated for by added N. A similar effect was observed for kernel vitreousness. Models developed from the response data can facilitate the potential transfer of these findings. Thus, in most growing seasons, minimum irrigation during the winter growing season, combined with appropriate fertilization, can enhance wheat output and yet maintain grain quality.

AB The contributions to this special issue have examined our current understanding of the adaptation of rainfed lowland rice to the abiotic stresses associated with drought, submergence and low soil fertility. Genetic variation has been identified for both broad adaptation across target rainfed lowland environments and specific adaptations to some of the abiotic stress environments, e.g, late season drought, and submergence during vegetative development. However, in general progress in genetic improvement of adaptation that contributes to higher and more stable yields has been extremely slow. The opportunities for increasing the rate of genetic improvement of grain yield is examined under the four headings: (1) the complexity of the target genotype-environment system; (2) the genetic resources available to the breeding programs; (3) clarity of the breeding objectives, capacity of the adopted breeding strategy to achieve the necessary genetic modifications and selection strategy; and (4) the physical and human resource capability to implement, evaluate and manage the necessary breeding strategies. Recommendations are made on priority research areas that are required to integrate the growing understanding of rainfed lowland rice adaptation and the needs of the breeding programs.

AB The effects on harvesting decisions of intertemporal and parametric changes in prices and forest owners' nonforest income are investigated using panel data. A behavioral timber supply function is derived using a utility-based rotation model, where the forest owner decides an optimal harvesting date for an even-aged stand simultaneously with his optimal life cycle consumption and savings. Capital markets are perfect and forests are valued in situ. The effects of intertemporal changes in the exogenous variables on the annual harvest are estimated using a fixed-effects tobit model and a sample of 119 Finnish farmer-forest owners in 1982-1991. The intertemporal effect on supply of timber price is positive while the effect of nonforest income is negative. The parametric effects of price and income levels on life cycle harvest, as measured by the average annual harvest per hectare over the sample period, are studied by using the estimated fixed effects and the individual sample means of exogenous variables. The parametric effect of the timber price level is negative and that of nonforestry income level positive. These signs are predicted by the utility-based rotation model, provided forests are valued in situ and the average harvest age is lower than that of maximum sustainable yield.

AB Sustainable forest management has replaced sustained yield as the new management strategy for most countries and forest companies. This concept has generated a lot of interest and discussion, and a great deal of effort is being made to modify current forestry practices to be sustainable. In this paper, we argue that the still somewhat vague concept of sustainable forest management calls for a substantial modification in our way of thinking about and practising forestry. To move toward that goal, we recognize important social and economic challenges to sustainable management and suggest nine essential notions: 1) manage the forest ecosystem as a whole and not in parts nor only for the crop species; 2) conserve a significant proportion of the boreal forest (i.e,, at least 12%); 3) practice intensive forestry on a small portion of the land to recover the fibre lost from notions 1 and 2; 4) strive for innovation in thinking and acting; 5) foster research and development to support notion 4; 6) balance regional needs with that of the global community; 7) encourage public participation; 8) consider the impact of substantial change in climate over the next 100 years (or next rotation); and 9) substitute regulations that are adaptive for those that are restrictive, An example of the kind of silviculture that could be used in ecosystem management for the black spruce forest is also discussed.

AB The concept and implementation of sustainable development are resulting in seemingly impossible goals for policy-makers and practitioners. Sustainability, in terms of government policies, tends to mean something quite different than what it means to Aboriginal peoples. Sustainability to Aboriginal peoples is not just about the environment and development; it is about survival of their peoples. Because of the close link between the social and economic elements of sustainable forest management, policies for strengthening the economic development of the forest sector are unlikely to be successful in the long run when they do not integrate environmental, social and cultural concerns. Innovative forest practice agreements (IFPAs) and other forms of community-based tenures offer vehicles to do so something unconventional - alternative mechanisms and means by which to incorporate indigenous knowledge and values and to implement Article 8(j) of the Convention on Biological Diversity.

ID DISTURBANCE
AB Biological diversity is our planet's inheritance from millions of years of evolution. It is nature's "insurance policy" against change, and a rich legacy which will help future generations of humans adjust to change. We squander this inheritance at our own risk, and to the detriment of future generations. Humans have been reducing the earth's biological inheritance for thousands of years, but we now have the knowledge, and hopefully the intelligence, to arrest this historical pattern. The idea has developed in western society that if something looks "nice," it must always be ecologically superior and better for biodiversity than something that is visually undesirable. There is also the idea, which appeals equally to our sensibilities, that there is a "balance of nature," that nature seeks and needs an equilibrium condition, and that change in this condition is bad. Ecosystem disturbance and change are seen as threats to both the survival of nature and to biodiversity. There is no evidence that such generalities are true, and lots of evidence that they are not. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. What may be judged to be "beautiful," sustainable and good stewardship by an ecologist or biodiversity expert may be ugly, at least for a peri od of time, to the average citizen. What may be beautiful to a person in the street may nor be sustainable of the very ecological and social values that they desire for their children's children. On the other hand, there are many examples in which visual images do provide an accurate assessment of ecological condition and sustainability. The challenge is to identify when our "gut reaction" to visual images provides a reliable basis for making changes in our relationship to resources and the environment, and when it does not. The key message is that we should let knowledge of the ecological and biological diversity of forests, and the associated values we wish to sustain, play a major role in deciding how the many different kinds of forests in the world should be managed. We must not permit dogma, mythology and untested or disproven ideas to prevent us from attaining our biodiversity and sustainability goals. We must not apply any one single forestry policy or management method everywhere, and we must balance the important aesthetic considerations with the ecology of the values we wish to sustain.

ID POLICY CHANGE; SECTOR
AB Supporters of sustainable forest management and forest certification are seeking to improve worldwide forest practices. Groups involved in the forest sector will have to adapt themselves to respect new environmental regulations, standards, and agreements linked to these two new concepts. Some forest stakeholders will lose several of their long-time privileges under the pressure of new actors involved in sustainable forest management. Forest managers will have to consider more social values in their planning than they used before. Sustainable forest management and forest certification thus have the potential to resolve, through public participation processes, old conflicts between stakeholders involved in forest management. However, these same processes could be the source of new conflicts. This article analyzes the ways in which relationships between forest stakeholders could be affected by new sustainable forest management rules.

AB 1. Life history and production were assessed for the crayfish Paranephrops zealandicus in three reaches of a headwater stream with a catchment of regenerating coniferous-broadleaf forest in the south-east of the South Island of New Zealand.
   2. Crayfish density ranged from 3 to 4 m(-2) in riffles and 4-12 m(-2) in pools, depending on reach. Crayfish biomass (4-33 g AFDW m(-2)) and annual production (2-11 g AFDW m(-2)) were high compared with values reported elsewhere, while P:B ratio was low (0.33-0.43). This substantial production was dependent primarily upon high biomass rather than high growth rate.
   3. The crayfish of this population rank amongst the longest lived and slowest growing ever recorded. Individuals estimated to be 16+ year of age were not uncommon. Females became reproductively active at 6+ year. Fewer than 4% of females carried eggs, and young remained attached to females for at least 15 months.
   4. We propose that characteristics of this population are the consequence of a cool thermal regime (mean daily stream temperature = 7.0 degrees C, range 1.8-11.9 degrees C), and that low biomass turnover and poor reproductive rate precludes any sustainable commercial harvest of crayfish from streams in New Zealand with similar thermal regimes.

TI Global civil society: lessons from ocean governance
SO FUTURES
LA English
DT Article
AB Late 20th century ideas about governance of the world's oceans may provide clues to the role of "civil society" in the 21st century. The UN Convention on Law of the Sea has radically changed traditional ideas about "national sovereignty", shifting its focus from territorial to functional, imposing on states the duty to cooperate and pay taxes, requiring the sharing of sovereign rights, and transcending sovereignty with the "common heritage" concept. The proliferation of nongovernmental organisations operating on the international stage is empowering all elements of a burgeoning global civil society. In some pioneering experiences in international relations, nongovernmental representatives sit on a par with delegates from governments. Most of the elements of global civil society-NGOs, international business, the community of scientists, worldwide media, and local communities-are not yet focused on the kinds of globalization that can narrow the rich-poor gap and promote sustainable development, but in the new century, a more global civil society can play a more constructive role.

AB A total of 70% of the world's conventional commercial fish species are now fully exploited, overexploited, depleted or recovering from depletion. This dramatic cl ash in the capture world fisheries production has led to problems in foods distribution, balance of payments, employment, and ecological depletion. Public support for breeding programs with terrestrial farm animals and plants in agriculture have revolutionized this industry over the past few hundred years. However, new genetic rearing technologies to improve marine animal production through aquaculture that utilize modern biology to obtain sustainable aquaculture and preserve biodiversity provide a promise to address these problems. However aquaculture has not been subject to public discussion and approval. Public involvement, not necessarily acquiescence, provide value added in the decision making process. Public understanding and involvement involves three stages. (i) Public concern over the pool of genetic information; (ii) if aquaculture is to respond to the fisheries crises with innovation, the knowledge gap between public understanding and scientific information must be bridged: and (iii) strategies must be developed for achieving this. Release of recombinant DNA to the environment, and handling exotic species, are useful case studies. Illustrations will be given of communication bridges to the public and ways to involve the public in making policy decisions. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

DE Peru; raised fields; waru waru; indigenous knowledge; ancient technology
AB Pre-Incan civilizations of the Central Andes occupied an area, at over 4000 metres elevation, which is today regarded as marginal for many basic crops. Away from the cities of the region, most land is natural grazing with very limited cultivation. This paper tackles the question of how the ancient civilizations could have built a dense population supporting both city life and a highly organized social and economic society as evidenced from archaeological findings. Part of the answer is thought to lie in the type of agricultural technology employed, together with the choice of food plants, which together ensured both quantity and quality of sustenance. Consideration is also given to the potential for use of the ancient technology in present-day farming, as a means of fostering sustainable development without reliance on investment by state or outside agencies.

DE Jamaica; small farming; domestic food supply; food security; evolution;
   dynamic continuum
AB There is a general consensus among Caribbean development planners that small-scale agricultural producers commonly referred to as small farmers, have an important role to play in sustainable domestic food supply and by extension, the food security of the region. In this regard, contraction in domestic food supply and increased dependence on imported food to meet nutritional demands have been attributed to under-utilization of land resources in the small-farming sector. While there is some truth to this claim, the adverse situation in the domestic food supply of Jamaica and the rest of the Caribbean is intimately related to the evolution of small farmers along a dynamic continuum.

DE biosphere; ecosphere; extraterrestrial ecospheres; Gaia; global
   ecosystem; global organism; Teilhard de Chardin; Vernadsky
AB The terms biosphere. ecosphere, and Gaia are used as names for the global ecosystem. However, each has more than one meaning. Biosphere can mean the totality of living things residing on the Earth, the space occupied by living things, or life and life-support systems (atmosphere, hydrosphere, lithosphere, and pedosphere). Ecosphere is used as a synonym of biosphere and as a term for zones in the universe where life as we know it should be sustainable. Gaia is similar to biosphere (in the sense of life and life-support systems) and ecosphere (in the sense of biosphere as life and life-support systems), but, in its most extreme form, refers to the entire planet as a living entity. A case is made for avoiding the term Gaia (at least as a name for the planetary ecosystem), restricting biosphere to the totality of living things, and adopting the ecosphere as the most apt name for the global ecosystem.

TI The new economy is stronger than you think
SO HARVARD BUSINESS REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
AB Many policy makers at the Fed contend that the new economy is a fragile bubble-and that with the "irrational exuberance" of the capital markets, the sky is going to fall on the U.S. economy. That couldn't be further from the truth, according to William Sahlman. As long as the government doesn't interfere, he argues, the economy is sturdy, resilient, and raring to grow.
   The new economy is strong for several reasons. First, it is based on a business model that works. Any business system that relentlessly drives out inefficiency, forces intelligent business-process reengineering, and gives customers more of what they want will be sustainable. Second, it is built on America's admiration for entrepreneurs and its tolerance for failure, not to mention its easy access to capital. Third, the new economy is attracting the best and brightest minds in the country. And finally, says Sahlman, the new economy is strong because it is spreading. It may be primarily an American phenomenon now, but in a few short years it will start to show its effects everywhere, making the whole world a more productive place.
   Still, Sahlman believes, the road ahead is not without potholes and sharp curves. But that is what the new economy is all about, he maintains-companies attacking the status quo and entrenched players, companies experimenting to find new technologies that improve or replace earlier ones. Such activity presents no cause for alarm. The economic, social, and cultural factors undergirding the new economy are rock solid. It's simply a matter of letting them stand.

AB Changes in polycarbonate surface properties induced by low frequency glow discharge in oxygen, nitrogen, and air atmospheres were studied. It was found that plasma modification results in significant hydrophilization of the polymer surface, which is retained for long time. Adhesion and surface energy involving the polar and dispersion components were calculated for both original and modified polycarbonate specimens. It was shown that the discharge treatment significantly increased their values and resulted in a predominant and sustainable increase in the polar component. By multiple attenuated total internal reflection IR spectroscopy, it was found that a significant quantity of polar oxygen-containing groups (involving hydroxyl groups) are formed in the plasma on the polycarbonate surface and these groups seem to be responsible for the enhancement of hydrophilicity of modified polycarbonate.

DE red water fern; biological control; mechanical control; herbicide
   control; utilization
AB Azolla filiculoides Lamarck (Pteridophyta: Azollaceae) (red water fern) is native to South America and was first recorded in South Africa in 1948. The lack of natural enemies and the presence of enriched waters have contributed to its establishment throughout the country where dense infestations cause severe degradation of aquatic ecosystems and limit their utilisation. The biology of A. filiculoides precludes it from being controlled manually or mechanically and herbicidal control in the aquatic environment is undesirable. Biological control is suggested as the only sustainable control method for this weed and a natural enemy, Stenopelmus rufinasus Gyllenhal (Coleptera: Curculionidae), was released for this purpose in late 1997. The weevil has established well and has caused a significant decline in the Azolla mat at a number of sites, suggesting that the weevil will be an efficient tool in the management of A. filiculoides in South Africa.

AB Information-gap (info-gap) modeling is put forth as a basic approach for enhancing decision making under uncertainty, especially when there is a high level of uncertainty and little information is available. The great need for having realistic techniques for describing severe uncertainty can be illustrated in water resources management by pointing out the wide range of uncertainties present in sustainable development when taking into account hydrological, socioeconomic, political, and other considerations. Some illustrative systems problems in watershed management are utilized to explain how info-gap modeling can be employed in practice.

AB The paper argues that a radical shift in the market for communications services is emerging, driven by the mass availability of cheap bandwidth, computing and global mobility combined with the pervasive rise of Internet based data services. At the same time, the Operation Support Systems (OSS's') that are essential in order to create business value from these technologies are lagging behind market need. The authors argue for a re-think of the humble management system into a complete software wrap-around of the network to deliver a value creation platform - as different from yesterday's OSS as the bakelite telephone is from today's tri-band mobile handsets. This software will be based on product standards, not paper ones and will require a major shift of gears from the position of today. This value creation platform will be built from advanced, component based software delivered through a very different market model to that of today. Much of this technology exists; we simply need critical mass behind a common approach. The discussion in this paper represents the personal views of the authors and does not necessarily represent the views of any organisation.

TI Strategic valuation of investment under competition
SO INTERFACES
LA English
DT Article
DE finance; capital budgets; industries; mining-metals
AB The most serious problem with the widely used discounted-cash-flow (DCF) methods of investment valuation is that they are commonly applied without explicit regard to competition. As a result, the prescriptions they afford are often inconsistent with those given by competitive strategy frameworks. To remedy this, we show how such frameworks can be integrated with DCF methods to value investments (and disinvestments) in competitive and uncertain contexts. We recommend that the DCF analysis be carried out within a framework that includes the following three analytical steps: positioning, which focuses on competitive advantages; sustainability, which focuses on competitive dynamics; and flexibility, which focuses on options to revise the initial investment plan in the face of uncertainty. Valuators using this framework will reduce the likelihood that the DCF analysis misses relevant competitive-strategy considerations. Firms that have used this framework for positioning, sustainability, and flexibility have shaped and clarified their choices, solving apparent inconsistencies between DCF results and the competitive-strategy argument.

AB This paper discusses the problems of implementing a European Union Technical Assistance to the Commonwealth of Independent States (of the former Soviet Union) (EU/TACIS) project to reform Mongolian Economics Higher Education with the ultimate objective of improving the process of economic policy making. It emphasises the importance of historical, economic and administrative context for the design and implementation of project activities. Project activities are reviewed and the problems of implementation discussed in terms of the aid relationship and the particular circumstances of transition economies. The paper concludes that, while the project's immediate objectives in terms of curriculum reform have been achieved, the sustainable change necessary to deliver the central, long-term objective remains elusive.

TI Solar-hydrogen: an energy system for sustainable development in Spain
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Achieving sustainable development is a target that is becoming more and more important to world-wide public opinion. Energy is one of the issues that is causing the most controversy, as fossil fuels are the greatest pollutants and the greatest contributors to the greenhouse effect. It therefore stands to reason that industrialised countries, which are the greatest consumers of fossil fuels, should be investigating new energy systems based on renewable energies that do not pollute and which are inexhaustible, such as the solar-hydrogen system.
   Central and southern Spain exhibit an excellent solar climate which makes them ideal places for producing hydrogen by photovoltaic-electrolysis systems. A model for a solar-hydrogen system for Spain has been developed and its advantages have been studied in terms of import dependency on fossil fuels, the gross national product per capita, the reduction of pollution and improved quality of life.
   If the solar-hydrogen system is not introduced, Spain will continue to import large amounts of fossil fuels during the next century and at the same time damaging the environment. On the other hand, producing solar-hydrogen via photovoltaic-electrolysis, using the unproductive land in central and southern Spain, will reduce its dependency on external energy, and Spain may even become an energy-exporting country, which would have a favourable effect on GNP growth and the quality of life.
   Also, as a result of the greater efficiency of hydrogen, major energy savings will be made, and, as it is practically a non-polluting fuel, pollution and environmental damage will be reduced and/or eliminated.

DE fixed-dose combinations; laboratories; bioavailability; rifampicin;
   quality assurance
AB Combining rifampicin in the same tablet with isoniazid, with or without pyrazinamide, is known to affect the bioavailability of the drug. It is also known that many fixed-dose combination (FDC) preparations exist in the market which are of inferior quality, but are unknowingly used extensively in tuberculosis treatment programmes in low-income countries with high tuberculosis caseloads. This has led to joint statements by the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease and the World Health Organization (WHO) pointing out that anti-tuberculosis FDCs should only be used in National Tuberculosis Programmes if the bioavailability of at least the rifampicin component has been demonstrated. Through the FDC Quality Assurance Project launched by the WHO in 1997, a strategy was proposed which aimed to provide specific guidance to ensure the improved quality of such preparations, and in particular the bioavailability of the rifampicin component. A crucial component of drug duality assurance is to ensure that the infrastructure and logistics required to carry out the operational aspects of quality assurance are adequate and sustainable. This paper describes the structures and management responsibilities required to meet this objective, based on general WHO guidelines for the quality assurance of pharmaceuticals.

AB Models which are built on the assumption of rational expectations can easily outline the conditions under which bubbles may exist but they remain silent on the hf tors that cause the price to deviate from the fundamental value. In this paper it is argued that dynamic extensions of the noise trader model of De Long et al. (1990a) may provide a behavioral explanation of persistent deviations of stock prices from their fundamental value if changing fundamentals and especially fundamental shocks are included. As a consequence the pattern and the sustainability of bubbles also depend on noise traders' reaction to fundamental shocks. In the multi period extension of the noise trader model developed in the paper noise trades' behavior is captured by two components. First, there is a fundamentally unwarranted optimism about the future development of dividends independent of the recent development of fundamentals, Second, noise traders overreact to an average of recent dividend shocks, which results in waves;of optimism or pessimism that create high price volatility The model shows that sustainable bubbles are slowly growing, while large overreactions ro fundamental shocks will result in fast growing bur frequently bursting bubbles.

AB This paper presents a scoping investigation of environment-friendly innovation,price and policy signals in Germany. The variables for sustainable innovation (special patent indicators) and for rational expectations (real crude oil import costs and expenditures for environmental protection) are cointegrated and need respective econometric treatment. The aim is to shed some light an the issue whether price signals spur innovation processes in the long run and how, in the short run, the interactions in innovation per environmental sector (waste treatment, water protection, noise reduction and clean air) function. The results show that the market mechanisms are distinct: In. the long run, the pace of technical progress for energy and resource saving follows the lead price: signal, whereby the couplings occur immediately. Yet, within the single environmental sectors, a variety of short-term interaction patterns is observed. Not always is it technical progress that spurs cost reactions, but there is an influence of government regulation and procurement, too. Most distinct observations offers the study of the interactions in the dean air policies of the past 15 years which did change a lot. Most of the rational expectations on measures and their impact came true.

AB Students who major in animal science at U.S. institutions are generally exposed to a curriculum that emphasizes commercial, large-scale production of the few traditional food animals: cattle, poultry, sheep, and swine. Globally, most farmers Live in lesser-developed countries under Limited-resource conditions of land, feed supplies, equipment, and capital. The promotion of commercial animal production enterprises may not be appropriate for such farms because it can subject farmers to considerable economic risk. Rather, use of limited numbers of large livestock, locally adapted breeds, or smaller livestock (e.g., ducks, goats, guinea pigs, and rabbits) may be more appropriate under subsistence, integrated farming systems. In this global context, a course in international animal agriculture has been taught for 15 yr to undergraduate and graduate students. The course consists of a review of traditional and potential Livestock species well suited for impoverished families on small farms and methods to implement sustainable livestock projects, including feasibility, design, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation stages. To enhance student understanding, global food issues and challenges are illustrated with case studies. A term paper is also assigned for which students choose three suitable livestock species or local breeds that would be complementary on a small crop farm (< 5 ha). Daily dietary requirements of protein and energy per family member are calculated. Itemized enterprise budgets and production tables are prepared. Early in the course, the general consensus of students was that people who are malnourished and live in poverty have low personal ambition and motivation, and that their problems should be amenable to solution by application of American technology and expertise. The course modifies such attitudes and enhances a student's critical thinking and problem-solving abilities and communication skills. Course evaluations indicated that students believed that it is important to acquire some international knowledge and understanding when seeking a job, and that certain animal science courses should contain some international content. Students gain an understanding of global animal agriculture and an appreciation of the complexity of food production and hunger issues.

AB Relationship marketing research to date has focused for the most part on two sets of issues. First, what are the benefits of relationship marketing adoption! Second, how are marketing relationships built and maintained! Although these ave important questions for researchers to address, we believe an understanding of the strategic impact of relationship marketing is equally important. We hold that relationship marketing should only be adopted when it offers, or contributes to, a firm's competitive advantage-a competitive advantage that, it is hoped, proves sustainable. As a first step toward better understanding the strategic role of relationship marketing, adopting a resource-based approach, we first clarify the role that resources gained through relationships may play in marketing relationships. Then we isolate and discuss the various hinds of resources that might be gained through relationships. Finally, we develop five propositions for assessing the strategic worth of these resources in marketing relationships. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Selecting cost-effective green building products: BEES approach
SO JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT-ASCE
LA English
DT Article
AB The Building for Environmental and Economic Sustainability (BEES) tool implements a rational, systematic technique for selecting cost-effective green building products. The technique is based on consensus standards and designed to be practical, flexible, and transparent. The Windows-based decision support software, aimed at designers, builders, and product manufacturers, includes actual environmental and economic performance data for 24 building products across a range of functional applications. BEES measures the environmental performance of building products using the environmental Life-cycle assessment approach specified in the latest versions of ISO 14000 draft standards. The approach is based on the belief that all stages in the Life of a product generate environmental impacts and must be analyzed. The stages include raw material acquisition, manufacture, transportation, installation, use, and waste management. Economic performance is measured using the ASTM standard life-cycle cost method. The technique includes the costs over a given study period of initial investment, replacement, operation, maintenance and repair, and disposal. Environmental and economic performance are combined into an overall performance measure using the ASTM standard for multiattribute decision analysis.

AB A retrospective cohort study was designed to determine differences in profitability, asset efficiency, operating efficiency, and labor efficiency between Michigan dairy farms implementing manage ment-intensive grazing (MIG) and conventionally managed dairy farms. Financial information and labor use data for the calendar year 1994 were collected with surveys and personal interviews from 35 MIG dairies and 18 conventionally managed dairies. Because the geographic distribution of MIG and conventionally managed farms in this study did not include Michigan's "dairy belt," extrapolation of these results to an average Michigan or Midwest dairy should be made with care. Within the areas represented, however, multivariate linear regression indicated that MIG dairies had more economic profit than conventionally managed dairies. They captured this profit by being more efficient in asset use, operating practices, and labor use. These results suggest that MIG could provide a sustainable alternate management tool far portions of Michigan's dairy industry.

AB Following Bernheim and Whinston (1990), this paper addresses the effects of multimarket contact on firms' ability to collude. Real world imperfections tend to make firms' objective function strictly concave and market supergames "interdependent": firms' payoffs in each market depend on how they are doing in others. Then, multimarket contact always facilitates collusion. It may even make collusion sustainable in all markets when otherwise it would not be sustainable in any. The effects of conglomeration are discussed. "Multigame contact" is shown to facilitate cooperation in supergames other than oligopolies as long as agents' objective function is submodular in material payoffs.

ID ENDOGENOUS GROWTH; COMPETITIVENESS
AB In Chapter 4 of their book ("Endogenous Growth Theory," MIT Press, Cambridge, MA (1998)), Aghion and Howitt introduce environmental pollution in an aggregate Schumpeterian model and characterize the optimal path. In this paper, we study the equilibria in a decentralized economy compatible with their model. First, we study the trade-off between environmental quality and growth and identify the channels of transmission of environmental policy into growth performance. Then, we compute the levels of the tools which are used to implement the optimum. (C) 1999 Academic Press.

SO JOURNAL OF FORESTRY

DT Article
AB Some of the most severely degraded forests of the Philippines are being restored by local community groups whose members are newcomers to forestry. As stakeholders, they are developing their own criteria and indicators for evaluating the environmental and social consequences of their field practices, with the technical assistance of the Philippine natural resources agency and other advisers. Eventually, those homegrown criteria may be used for external assessments by international certifying organizations. Although establishing criteria and indicators cannot guarantee sustainable forest management, initial results indicate that they can prevent field practices from further degrading the country's forest ecosystems and forest-dependent communities.

AB The AF&PA Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI) has been substantially improved in 1999. The program has been reformatted as a formal standard, and now offers a licensing program for nonmembers and a voluntary verification process through which AF&PA members and SFI licensees can be third-party verified to the standard. The ISO Technical Report on Forestry (ISO/TR 14061) outlines how foresters can incorporate performance-based standards, such as the SFI, into their ISO 1400I environmental management system policy, objectives, and targets.

AB The business press has coined the term "pie expansion" to refer to the collaborative process of creating mutually beneficial strategic outcomes between buyers and suppliers. In this research, the author provides an explanation of this process, hypothesizing that such outcomes are achieved through the use of coordination efforts across organizational boundaries and specialized investments, The author investigates the facilitating roles of various environmental, interorganizational, and interpersonal conditions in this process. The results of a longitudinal survey of more than 220 buyers and suppliers indicate that the collaboration process is worthwhile, with coordination efforts and investments leading to enhanced profit performance and the realization of competitive advantages over time. Environmental dynamism and demand motivate suppliers to form collaborative exchanges with buyers and facilitate the dyad's willingness to create idiosyncratic investments. Goal congruence and interpersonal trust facilitate coordination effort, and complementary capabilities facilitate both effort and investments.

AB The composite interfaces play an important role in determining the resultant composite properties, especially the development of interfacial reaction during remelting is critical to the commercialization and sustainable-development of metal matrix composites. In this paper, the interfacial reaction characteristics of SiCp/Al-Si system composites during multiple-remelting were investigated by Differential Scanning Calorimeter (DSC). It was found that the interfacial reactions were not sensitive to remelting number, remelting temperature and reinforcement volume fraction after a degree of reaction, and the results also suggested that the preventation effects of Si upon the interfacial reaction SiCp/Al were mainly attributed to the Si released from the interfacial reaction, while the original Si content in the master alloy also has the same effect only after a given Si content.

AB A foundation is provided for a correct and accurate analysis of the relationship between monetary values and physical dimensions in economic production. A distinction is proposed between direct and indirect substitution. Linked to this, a classification is offered of various types of substitutability and complementarity relationships between production factors. It is argued that the neoclassical production function may be consistent with mass balance, but is unsuitable for a detailed and accurate understanding of changes in production that influence materials use. For this purpose, general production functions satisfying mass balance are formulated, drawing upon the proposed classifications. (JEL Q20).

TI Initiation of an aquaculture of sponges for the sustainable production

AB Among Metazoa, sponges (phylum Porifera) are the richest source for different bioactive compounds. The availability of the raw material is, however, restricted. To obtain enough of the bioactive compounds for application in human therapy, sponges have to be cultured in in vitro systems. One technique for the establishment of a long-term cell culture from sponges has recently been elaborated. Here, we present a procedure to cultivate tissue samples from sponges in an open system. The species Geodia cydonium, which produces bioactive compounds, has been selected. Tissue samples of approximately 10 g were attached to the bottoms of cultivation trays. After 2 to 3 days, the tissue samples formed a robust contact with the metal support. Subsequently, sets of trays, called tray batteries, either remained in huge aquaria at the Center for Marine Research or were transferred to the vicinity of a fish and mussel farm. The growth rates of the samples remained unchanged within the first month; however, after 3 and 6 months, they increased to 147% and 189%, respectively. In parallel, extracts were prepared from the tissue samples and tested for cytotoxicity in a mouse lymphoma cell assay system. Extracts from cultured tissue initially had a low inhibitory potency; however, after cultivation for 3 or 6 months, values comparable to those of extracts from sponges taken from the biotope were found. In addition, a molecular marker was applied to document. the response (health state) of the tissue and the identity of the material in culture. The CD63 molecule was chosen because the expression of this molecule in mammalian systems changes with the age of the animals. The corresponding complementary DNA was isolated from Geodia cydonium. With this probe, the level of expression in cultured tissue samples decreased immediately after starting cultivation; after a cultivation period of 6 months, however, values were similar to those found in controls. These data show that sponge species that produce bioactive compounds can be cultivated in open systems, in which they retain their potency to produce bioactive compounds as well as their health state.

AB In South Africa, political emancipation has resulted in a new fisheries policy which is embodied in the Marine Living Resources Act of 1998. The pillars of the new policy are sustainability, equity and stability within the industry. We look particularly at a suite of mainly accessible species, the rock lobsters (truly spiny lobsters), at their management, at control measures, at realities of resource status and harvesting, at naturally occurring ecosystem stimuli, and investigate whether the policy can achieve what it aims to do, to provide more for more South Africans at levels at least equal to what they do today. Put simply, are the political aims and the sustainability aims of the new policy mutually achievable? (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB As one of the goals of molecular simulation packages, an on-line simulation system named a virtual microscope is developed, in which chemical reactions are reproduced numerically on supercomputers based on quantum mechanics and Newtonian physics, and then motions of the nuclei and electrons are displayed on the computer graphics. To achieve the virtual microscope, the ab initio molecular orbital (MO) theory is unified with molecular dynamics, since the proper forces acting on the nuclei are obtained by the energy gradient method in the ab initio MO scheme. In the virtual microscope, the viewing position is interactively changed during the simulation so as to chase the key atoms in that reaction. The functionality of the virtual microscope is given in this article along with the system organizations and sustainable performance of the numerical portions.

AB With large tracts of once continuous forest now modified by human use to leave reduced and highly fragmented stands of trees, the determination of the genetic consequences of forest fragmentation is a priority for ascertaining the conservation value of resultant stands, and in formulating sustainable management strategies. The levels and distribution of genetic diversity over 10 microsatellite loci were investigated within a fragmented population of the neotropical tree Swietenia humilis Zucc. High levels of genetic variation, typical of a highly outcrossing species, were found in all fragments at all loci (mean H-E = 0.548). The majority of the variation was within rather than between fragments (R-ST = 0.032), giving high indirect estimates of gene now (Nm = 8.9), probably reflecting the genetic structure of the trees present under more continuous forest. A high proportion of loci also showed significant departures from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium with associated significant levels of F-IS. The initial effects of fragmentation were, however, seen in the fragments through the loss of low-frequency alleles present in the continuous 'control' stand. The percentage of this allelic loss increased with a decrease in fragment size.

AB Combined applications of manure and inorganic fertilizer (integrated nutrient management) may allow sustainable cropping with higher productivity and larger economic benefits than applications of either one alone. This is being examined in three of the major crop rotations in the mid-hills of Nepal. These are rice-wheat on irrigated khet land, millet, either relayed or grown sequentially after maize, on rain-fed bari land, and blackgram grown after upland rice on ancient river terraces, tar land. At each of the six sites seven different nutrient treatments were applied either to a single crop (maize and upland rice) or to both crops (rice and wheat) in the rotation. Manure or inorganic fertilizer, or equal parts of both, were applied at a high rate and at half that rate. A treatment with no additions was also included. Crops of millet and blackgram were unfertilized.
   Grain yields of maize, upland rice, wheat, and rice were greater at the higher rate of N, as were straw yields. Grain and straw yields were greatest following application of fertilizer alone, except for maize at Pakhribas and wheat at Kholitar, and rice grain yields at Kholitar. For most crops, labor costs exceeded the market value of the yields from the zero-input treatment. Partial budget analysis showed that margins were generally negative when manure was applied either alone or in combination with fertilizer, but positive with applications of fertilizer. Results imply that applications of fertilizer are advantageous in the short-term.

AB This study addresses the issue of designing farming systems for low input conditions. By focusing on the problem of feed (=resource) allocation in livestock systems it provides clues for the design of alternative agricultural systems and systems in general. Linear programming (LP) is used to examine system behaviour under conditions of varying feed resource qualities, for individual animal production levels that range from 0.75 to 3.00 times maintenance. Milk yield, animal numbers and amounts of feed offered or refused are measures of system performance in two hypothetical Cases representative for actual fanning systems. Case 1 considers available feed as one aggregated resource, with an average nutritive value ranging from that of straw to that of high quality forage. It establishes the individual animal output level that is required to achieve maximum total system output from a given feed resource. In Case 2, animals of different production levels are allowed to select between two feed resources that, through proper definition of the their proportions on offer, on average represent the same feed quality scale as in Case 1. The possibility of selection, however, allows the nutritive value of the actual intake to differ from the average nutritive value of feed offered. Better feed and higher (potential) individual animal output tend to increase total system output in terms of milk, by reducing the number of animals, Nevertheless, the term 'damning objective' is introduced to express that high targets for subsystem output reduces total system output if subsystem requirements exceed resource availability. Moreover, heterogeneity of (feed) resources can increase system output by using more production units with lower individual output. The results are tested against farmers' practice and situations reported in literature. Implications for the design of sustainable systems and further research are discussed.

AB The article treats the recent development of quasi-steady ELMy high beta(p) H mode discharges with enhanced confinement and high beta stability, where long sustainment time, an increase in absolute fusion performance and extension of the discharge regime towards low q(95) (similar to 3) are emphasized. After modification to the new W shaped pumped divertor, a long heating time (9 s) with a high total heating energy input of 203 MJ became possible without a harmful increase in impurity and particle recycling. In addition, optimization of the pressure profile characterized by the double transport barriers, optimum electron density and/or high triangularity delta made it possible to extend the performance in long pulses. The DT equivalent fusion gain Q(DT)(eq) approximate to 0.1 (delta = 0.16) was sustained for similar to 9 s (similar to 50 tau(E), similar to 10 tau(p)*) and Q(DT)(eq) approximate to 0.16 (delta = 0.3) for 4.5 s at I-p = 1.5 MA. In the latter case with higher delta, an H factor (=tau(E)/tau(E)(ITER89PL)) of similar to 2.2, beta(N) approximate to 1.9 and beta(p) approximate to 1.6 were sustained with 60-70% of the non-inductively driven current. In the low q(95) (similar to 3) region, the beta limit was improved by the high delta (similar to 0.46) shape, where beta(N) approximate to 2.5-2.7 was sustained for similar to 3.5 s with the collisionality close to that of ITER-FDR plasmas. The limit of the edge alpha parameter in the ELMy phase increases with delta, which is the main reason behind the improved beta limit in a long pulse at high delta. The sustainable value of beta(N)H also increases with delta. Sustainable beta(N) is limited by the onset of low n resistive modes. Direct measurement of island width shows agreement with the neoclassical tearing mode theory.

AB The ZoNeCo programme, devoted to the evaluation of living and non-living marine resources within the Economic Zone of New Caledonia, illustrates clearly the Marine Benthic Habitats concept. It exhibits the study of the physical environment and disciplines such as geology and physical oceanography. The results acquired in these fields are used as bases to study the presence and the distribution of living species within a given habitat. The knowledge of all the parameters relative to each discipline is a useful guide for the evaluation and the sustainable management of living and nonliving resources.

ID GROWTH
AB Major commercial fisheries for orange roughy (Hoplostethus atlanticus) occur on seamount features, which are widely distributed throughout the New Zealand region. When the fishery developed in the late 1970s to early 1980s, it occurred mainly on flat bottom, but over time has become more focused on seamounts. In the 1995-1996 fishing year, it is estimated that about 70 % of the catch of orange roughy within the New Zealand EEZ was taken from seamounts. Seamounts on the Chatham Rise have been fished for over ten years. Examination of commercial catch and effort data show strong declines in catch rates over time, and a pattern of serial depletion of seamount populations, with the fishery moving progressively eastwards to unfished seamounts along the southern margins of the Rise. Catch rates on seamounts in other regions of New Zealand have also generally shown a similar pattern of rapid decline. There is growing concern over the impact of trawling on seamounts, and the effects this can have on the benthic habitat and fauna, and the long-term sustainability of associated commercial fisheries.

AB The importance of habitat to Fisheries production on Australia's southeast continental shelf is part of a five-year study of ecosystem functioning and its implications for a sustainable fishery. Benthic habitats from 40 m to similar to 200 m were studied, based on identification of suitable sites from local fishers' information. Results presented here concentrate on data from a single mesohabitat at 40-60 m depth collected over two days. Macrohabitats within this mesohabitat were discriminated as soft, hard and rough from visual inspection of acoustic echograms. Subsequent analysis of the return echoes using roughness and hardness indices did not significantly improve real-time visual discriminations. Macrohabitats were sampled with an underwater video camera, sediment sampler, benthic sled, demersal trawl, gillnets and fish traps to relate the acoustic classifications to biological habitats. There were distinct differences in the benthic and fish communities between macrohabitats discriminated by acoustics. We concluded that discrimination of habitats from visual inspection of echograms, plus limited verification with physical sampling, could provide sufficient information for spatial management. However, successful management of individual species, the fish community and the ecosystem requires an understanding of the association of fishes with habitat at the macrohabitat and mesohabitat level, and its variability through time.

AB Nocturnal geckos can actively forage at low temperatures. A low minimum cost of locomotion allows greater sustainable speeds by partially offsetting the decrease in maximal oxygen consumption (Vo(2max)) associated with low nocturnal temperatures. The nocturnality hypothesis (Autumn et al. 1997) proposes that the reduced cost of continuous locomotion is a shared, derived characteristic that increases the capacity to sustain locomotion at low temperatures. Yet many lizards move intermittently at speeds exceeding those that elicit Vo(2max). We exercised the frog-eyed gecko, Teratoscincus przewalskii, continuously and intermittently on a treadmill. At an exercise speed of 0.90 km h(-1) (270% maximum aerobic speed), lizards alternating a 15-s exercise period with a 30-s pause period exhibited a 1.7-fold increase in distance capacity (total distance traveled before fatigue) compared with lizards exercised continuously at the same average speed (0.30 km h(-1)). The average aerobic cost of intermittent exercise was not significantly different from Vo(2max). Locomoting intermittently could augment the increase in endurance resulting from the low minimum cost of continuous locomotion in nocturnal geckos. Intermittent behavior could increase the endurance of lizard movement in general.

AB Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) certification systems have been developed to provide assurance to customers and the public that forest resources are being managed in a responsible and sustainable manner. The credibility of SFM certification systems will depend to a large extent on the ability of forest owners and managers to develop performance indicators that are meaningful at local, regional and global levels. Verification of SFM systems and performance will be equally important. Selected certification systems are discussed with regard to performance measurement and audit requirements. The application of basic auditing principles to the verification of SFM systems is discussed. In contrast with the rigor of the audit process, the challenges faced by Weldwood of Canada Limited in developing meaningful, and auditable, SFM performance measures are also discussed.

AB Current research in industrial engineering and management sciences shows that organizational architectures are of critical importance for a better performance of product creation processes in terms of creativity, quality and speed. For many companies, streamlining those processes-including engineering-is of vital importance for their survival in a global and turbulent marketplace. However, the most commonly used solution-the matrix structure-does not support this effort sufficiently. Based on diagnoses of both problems and solutions in 11 industrial companies in the Netherlands and the United States, a new configuration emerged: an organizational arrangement consisting of several temporary team network organizations, one for each product creation project, to be drawn from a sustainable pool of professionals representing multiple competencies. This novel, dynamic organizational architecture is clarified in terms of its opportunities for improved creativity, quality and speed, using chaordic systems thinking as a lens.

AB Fishways for salmon in temperate rivers have often been successful, but salmonid-type fishways for non-salmonid species in tropical and subtropical rivers have frequently failed. This study assessed the effectiveness of modifying a salmonid-type pool-and-weir fishway into a vertical-slot design on a tidal barrage on the subtropical Fitzroy River, in Queensland, north-eastern Australia. In 38 paired samples of the top and bottom of the fishway, over 16 months, 29 fish species and over 23 000 fish were collected at a maximum rate of 3400 per day. This study shows much greater potential for success with a vertical-slot fishway as relatively few fish negotiated the original pool-and-weir design. Common species using the vertical-slot fishway included blue-catfish (Arius graeffei [Ariidae]), bony herring (Nematalosa erebi [Clupeidae]), striped mullet (Mugil cephalus [Mugilidae]), barramundi (Lates calcarifer [Centropomidae]). and long-finned eels (Anguilla reinhardtii [Anguillidae]). Freshwater shrimp (Macrobrachium australiense [Palaemonidae]), juvenile crabs (Varuna litterata [Grapsidae]) and long-finned elvers did not ascend the full length of the fishway and specific fishways for these species are recommended. Fish between 25 and 640 mm in length ascended the fishway, although the passage of smaller size classes of immature fish was restricted and this may be important for the sustainability of these migratory populations.
   The barramundi (200-640 mm) which ascended the fishway were all immature fish. However, during a period of low river flows enlarging the width of the vertical-slot from 0.15 to 0.45 m only encouraged a small number of larger fish (890 mm maximum length) to enter. The strong diel movement patterns of many species will need to be considered in future fishway design. Blue-catfish could ascend the fishway in 2 h, but many fish remained in the fishway and this behaviour may cause crowding and a reduction in fishway capacity. Further work is needed to assess the proportion of fish finding the fishway entrance. However, the findings suggest that vertical-slot fishways with lower water velocities and turbulence than salmonid fishways have great potential to pass the diverse migratory fish fauna of subtropical and tropical rivers.

AB Central European Countries will have to choose an exchange rate system vis a vis the European Monetary Union: flexibility or more likely fixity of the nominal or real exchange rate. We first build a theoretical model with overlapping generations and two sectors (traditionnal and advanced) representing a Central European country. We assume that financial integration into Europe will reduce the interest rate risk premium paid by country on its external debt We analyse the effects of this evolution on the optimal use of this inflation in order to stabilise public debt, with or without tax distorsions. We also examine the effects of integration on the of the economy, on relative prices and on the normal parity vis a vis Euro. Those analyses allow us to adress the issue of the sustainability of fixed nominal exchange rates for Central European countries.
   We also think that the integration in the Monetary Union will lead to a suppression to the subsidies those countries had previously put in place, and we try to assess the effect of this suppression on optimal inflation, then on the possibility to maintain fixed nominal exchange rates.

ID POLYMORPHISM
AB Presently, sheep (1096 millions) and goat production (677 millions) are the second and fourth largest livestock groups at the world level, respectively. In industrialized countries, sheep farming is more important (40.0%) than goat production (4.6%). During the last 15 years, the number of sheep has diminished at the world level, whereas the number of goats has strongly increased. Overall, production of small ruminants (meat, milk and fiber) grew substantially in developing countries, but stagnated or decreased in industrialized countries. Significant progress in research was achieved during recent years with small ruminants, particularly in the field of biotechnology. Transgenesis and other relevant areas of research will develop further in the near future, meanwhile, cloning, embryo transfer, etc. have already interesting applications. Identification of genetic mechanisms explaining the polymorphism of certain characters, e.g. alpha-s 1 casein content of goat milk can have interesting consequences in future selection programs. However, there are still large discrepancies between the availability of scientific knowledge and its application in sheep and goat husbandry in most production areas. Consequently, a strong effort has to be made to improve research efficiency and particularly technology transfer. Due to the high research costs, the organization of regional research and development networks should allow, in the end, the best results. Development actions in the sheep and goat sector show a definite delay compared to other animal productions. To become more efficient, research in this field must apply more specific methods directed to the reality of small ruminant production. Research and extension planners must accept the role of the breeders as far as decision making is concerned, and define sustainable policies, especially at the levels of structures of national and international development, but also by providing efficient tools to facilitate decision making.

AB Small ruminant genetic resources (SRGR) in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) play an important role in the welfare of the people, especially the resource poor. SSA is endowed with a diverse SRGR maintained under equally diverse and complex production systems. The public and the private sectors are key actors involved in the conservation and management of SRGR in SSA but with the latter playing a dominant role. Currently the emphasis is on in-situ rather than ex-situ conservation and management. In order to make SRGR conservation attractive and sustainable, the strategy must be associated with some economic benefits. This could be achieved by commercialising SRGR by adding value to them, particularly the indigenous varieties. There is also a need to promote conservation awareness and build capacity among the stakeholders through research, extension and training. Policy changes and political as well as financial commitment are needed at both national and regional levels to implement these actions. (C) 1999 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

DE small ruminants; development programs
AB For more than half a century, Heifer Project International (HPI), a charitable organization headquartered in Little Rock, AR, has been providing livestock and training in animal husbandry and sustainable agriculture to developing areas throughout the world. Since 1944, more than four million families have been assisted. More than 20 different kinds of food- and income-producing animals have been provided for communities and families in over 110 countries worldwide. Annually, HPI has projects in approximately 40 countries. Intensive training in animal husbandry, environmentally sound animal agriculture practices and community development are all part of HPI's program. HPI has had a long history with using small ruminants, from sheep and goats to llamas and alpacas, around the world. Small ruminants are of a most convenient size and prolificacy for the small holders that HPI typically partners with, and they are among the most diverse and multipurpose of all livestock species. In Asia, HPI uses small ruminants in development programs in the People's Republic of China, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Thailand, India, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bangladesh, Vietnam and Indonesia. All of these programs are with limited resource families living in marginal, rural conditions. The programs are geared toward increasing peoples' income and nutritional status, while enhancing their dignity and benefitting the ecology. (C) 1999 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

DE woman; sheep and goat; economics
AB The role of woman in the agricultural sector, especially as keepers of small livestock such as sheep and goats, greatly increases world food security by improving the health and livelihood of individual families. Studies by the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO) confirm that while women are the mainstay of small-scale agriculture, farm labor force and day-to-day family subsistence, they have more difficulties than men in gaining access to resources such as land and credit and other productivity enhancing inputs and services (Women and Sustainable Food Security, 1996). Recent statistics also point to the fact that the percentage of women who experience poverty is greater than that of men. Hunger and malnutrition affect more than 780 million people in the developing world; 550 million rural women live below the poverty line in their respective countries.

SO SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL

ID HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY; WATER-BALANCE; NO-TILLAGE; SOIL; PASTURE; FOREST
AB Sustainable land use in periodically dry Brazilian savannas requires a water-saving management. We hypothesized that the annual course of matric potentials (psi(M)) in very-fine, isohyperthermic Anionic Acrus-toxes of Pinus plantations (PI), degraded (DP) and productive pastures (PP), no-till (NT) and conventional tillage (CT) cropping, and natural savanna (Cerrado, CE) differed significantly. On three plots in each of these land-use systems water input and psi(M) at the 0.15-, 0.30-, 0.80-, 1.2-, and 2.0-m depths was measured with tensiometers weekly between 27 Mar. 1997 and 28 Apr. 1998. Precipitation between 29 Apr. 1997 and 28 Apr. 1998 was 1562 mm, with only 210 mm in May to September, when psi(M) at the 0.15- and 0.30-m depths decreased to less than -80 kPa in all systems; the lowest psi(M) at 2-m depth was -57 kPa. During the monitored period, the PI soils had lower average psi(M) at the 0.8- to 2-m depths (-60 kPa) than those in CE (-46), indicating higher rainfall interception losses and higher transpiration. In CT, average psi(M) values at the 0.8- to 2-m depths (-29) were higher than in NT (-51) because of different crops and different soil management. Between June and November, psi(M) at the 2-m depth in CE decreased to a lower value (-42) than in vegetation-free CT (-22) and NT (-27). In DP and PP soils, psi(M)S were similar to those in CE soils at all depths. The estimated average water storage in the upper 2 m during the monitored period was: 565 mm (CT) > 553 (PP) > 541 (DP) > 537 (CE) > 526 (NT) > 479 (PI). Our results show that mainly the vegetation type and tillage practices control the annual course of matric potential in differently used savanna Oxisols.

SO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper reviews some of the literature and guidance provided for businesses considering responses to the environmental aspects and impacts of their tourist activities. It concentrates on the role of individual business organizations within the tourism industry and examines both supply-side (production) and demand-side (consumption) policies. In its review of a number of guidelines the paper attempts to make recommendations for improving both the provision of tourism services through supply chain management and destination management, and the education of the consumer in ways which make tourism more consistent with the concept of sustainable development. This emphasizes the need for businesses involved in tourism provision not only to look at the supply side and the demand side of their activities but also to provide stronger signals between the two parts so that more meaningful progress is made towards sustainable tourism. It places considerable emphasis on the role of intermediaries in bridging the gap between demand and supply. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

TI Environmentalism in periods of rapid societal transformation: The legacy
   of the industrial revolution in the United Kingdom and the Meiji
   restoration in Japan
SO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB The pursuit of: environmental sustainability implies dramatic transformation of modem society in order to bring about a more benign interaction between human and natural systems. It is now widely recognized that this paradigm shift would require the restructuring of society in order to deal with increasingly complex environmental problems and the current high rates at which natural resources are being depleted. These changes need to be made quickly, say within the next 50 years, since the world's population in 2050 would be between 10 and 12 billion.
   Examples of breathtakingly rapid societal change in the past include the Industrial Revolution in the United Kingdom and the Meiji Restoration in Japan. The direction of change, however, was a move away from the relatively close (though not necessarily harmonious) relationship between humans and nature found in rural societies to one characterized by distance and isolation in the new factories and industrial towns. Meanwhile, pollution problems, which have always been associated with urbanity, became more widespread and intensified.
   Related to this, the notions of environmentalism began to take shape in both countries during these periods. In the United Kingdom, the roots of environmentalism are intertwined with the Romantic Movement that sought to conserve the natural beauty ol the land and cultural heritage of the nation. In Japan, the Meiji Restoration witnessed the emergence of new social movements backed by intellectuals fighting for popular rights and against development.

SO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Tunisia is a North African country undergoing rapid development. It has a range of environmental problems including soil erosion, desertification, sedimentation and reduction in biological diversity that are partly caused by the climate and compounded by development processes such as industrialization, urbanization and population growth. Consequently, Tunisia is suffering from the inevitable conflicts between environmental protection on the one hand and sustainable development on the other. The background to the development of environmental protection in Tunisia has been reviewed. The potential impact of new environmental legislation and awareness on the environment has been appraised based on observations gathered during field visits in 1996 and 1998. The majority of the field sites have provided positive examples for the Tunisian environmental programme. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

ID TECHNOLOGY
AB This analysis adopts a long-wave perspective in order to shed light on the dynamics that led to a global shift away from primary reliance on coal and towards over-reliance on petroleum. It is argued that the interaction of three systemic dynamics, those of geopolitical rivalry, commercial competition, and social unrest, undermined the nineteenth-century international coal regime and paved the way fur the consolidation of an international petroleum system in the twentieth century. By examining contemporary patterns of state and private investments in a cluster of new energy technologies. as well as the growing influence of environmental regulations, it is argued that similar dynamics are beginning to favor a shift rewards a new, more sustainable energy regime in the coming century.

   variability
ID UPLAND
AB The Georgia Coastal Plain of the United States holds significant agricultural and hydrologic importance. The profitability and sustainability of agriculture in this and other regions are dependent upon climatic patterns and, in particular; rainfall. The temporal and spatial variability of this rainfall play key roles in agricultural management. Developing an understanding of seasonal patterns and individual storm characteristics is critical. Thirty years of rainfall data collected from a dense rain gage network on the 334 km(2) Little River Watershed near Tifton Georgia, were analyzed for this purpose. Storm patterns were characterized by season to establish means and trends. Individual storm characteristics and spatial correlation patterns within storms were quantified. Rainfall patterns, although highly variable from year to year show rainfall to be greatest in the midsummer months with high intensity, convective thunderstorms. While these summer storms yield relatively low rainfall depths, they occur more frequently than during other seasons. Frontal storms with moderate rainfall amounts are typical of the winter and spring months. The fall months generally have low rainfall totals and storms during this time occur less frequently than during the other months. For larger storm events, defined here as those where at least one rain gage in the network measured 25.4 mm or greater during the event, the mean storm depth weighted over the mean storm coverage of 295 km(2) was 20.6 mm, while the mean storm duration was 7.2 h. For these larger events, the summer storms are separated by the least time between events (mean of 116 h) while the fall events are separated by the greatest time (mean of 291 h). For summer events, rain gage depths for individual storm events collected by gages separated by 1.9 km or less are likely to be highly correlated (r greater than or equal to 0.9). This distance increases to 9.2 km for the winter High correlations (r greater than or equal to 0.9) are expected up to distances of 5 km throughout most of the year except summer: This analysis establishes the basis for detailed modeling across this and other watersheds in the region.

AB Soil erosion remains the most significant threat to long-term agricultural sustainability. In order to determine if highly erodible silty upland soils could be row-cropped while conforming to the conservation provisions of the Food Security Act, we measured natural-rainfall runoff and soil loss for sir years from eight alternative cropping systems on sixteen 4% slope plots and three small watersheds in north Mississippi. Several conservation cropping systems slightly reduced runoff and greatly decreased erosion on these soils. On erosion plots, no-till for soybean, corn, or sorghum reduced soil loss by more than 80% and no-till for cotton by more than 70% as compared to conventionally tilled soybean. Ridge-till was more than twice as erodible as no-till, while no-till soybean double-cropped with wheat was least erodible of the eight systems studied. On small watersheds, annual sediment yield ranged up to about 30 t/ha for conventional tillage soybean with buffer strips and grassed waterways but, after the first year never exceeded 1 t/ha for no-till soybean. However; no-tillage alone was not adequate to control concentrated-flow headcuts. Most conservation systems decreased runoff by at least 10%. No-till sorghum or corn with a vetch cover crop generally decreased runoff most, and double-cropped soybean-wheat had less than 75% of the runoff of conventional soybean. Greatest reductions occurred during years of higher runoff amounts. Runoff per unit of area from the watersheds was much greater than from comparable erosion plots, indicating that extrapolation of plot data to field areas merits careful consideration of their relative soil and topographic characteristics. This research demonstrated that several no-tillage cropping systems can keep erosion below tolerable limits, reduce runoff somewhat, and be economically profitable. When combined with complementary conservation practices such as waterways and grass hedges, they provide methods for achieving both effective conservation and sustainable production when intensively cropping erodible upland soils of the southern United States.

AB In large experimental trials throughout Africa, insecticide-treated bednets and curtains have reduced child mortality in malaria-endemic communities by 15%-30%. While few questions remain about the efficacy of this intervention, operational issues around how to implement and sustain insecticide-treated materials (ITM) projects need attention. We revisited the site of a small-scale ITM intervention trial, 3 years after the project ended, to assess how local attitudes and practices had changed. Qualitative and quantitative methods, including 16 focus group discussions and a household survey (n = 60), were employed to assess use, maintenance, retreatment and perceptions of ITM and the insecticide in former study communities. Families that had been issued bednets were more likely to have kept and maintained them and valued bednets more highly than those who had been issued curtains. While most households retained their original bednets, none had treated them with insecticide since the intervention trial was completed 3 years earlier. Most of those who had been issued bednets repaired them, but none acquired new or replacement nets. In contrast, households that had been issued insecticide-treated curtains often removed them. Three (15%) of the households issued curtains had purchased one or more bednets since the study ended. In households where bednets had been issued, children 10 years of age and younger were a third as likely to sleep under a net as were adults (relative risk (RR) = 0.32; 95% confidence interval (95%CI) = 0.19, 0.53). Understanding how and why optimal ITM use declined following this small-scale intervention trial can suggest measures that may improve the sustainability of current and future ITM efforts.

AB Natural environmental changes and human activities have altered forest growth for centuries. Recent long-term growth investigations indicate an increasing growth trend in European forests. The investigations are based on forest inventory, permanent plot and tree analysis data. The observed trends are species specific, locally varying and modified by remarkably large periodic growth variations. On a European scale, species and site specific quantitative information about the extent and spatial as well as temporal variation in growth acceleration is lacking. Future growth development may differ from past observations. A better understanding of changes in site conditions, their causes and consequences is needed to guide sustainable management of European forests.

AB Technically, those who participate in planning for sustainable development should understand what causes environmental degradation, because environmental degradation equates to the reverse of sustainable development. But in a democratic planning process what members of the public take to be the causes of environmental degradation matters as much as what experts say the causes really are. A study was therefore conducted to determine how laypersons involved in planning explain environmental degradation. The main method was content analysis of written submissions to public hearings of the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence Round Table of the Lands for Life sustainable land use planning process in Ontario, Canada. Results indicate that members of the Lands for Life public, decision-makers, and planners all have an inadequate appreciation of the causes of environmental degradation.

AB In order to evaluate the impacts of alternative stand-level management scenarios on long-term site productivity, forest resource managers need ecologically based forest growth models. The FORECAST forest ecosystem management simulation model combines the traditional bioassay modelling approach with process-based simulation modelling to provide a method of projecting future forest biomass yield as well as a variety of other ecosystem variables and social values under a range of management conditions. A review of the hybrid simulation approach to modelling forest ecosystems is provided, and the representation of stand-level net primary production and nutrient cycling in FORECAST is described. The major driving function in the model (shade-corrected foliage nitrogen efficiency), the concept of site quality, and the simulation of site quality change are discussed. The value of an accurate definition of the state of the simulated ecosystem at the start of a run is emphasized, and the use of the ECOSTATE (STATE Of the Ecosystem, as generated by FORECAST) file in this process is described. Limitations of the FORECAST modelling approach are reviewed. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Defenders of Wildlife, a national non-profit conservation organization, has facilitated several processes to determine which incentive options are the most likely to produce tangible benefits to biodiversity. The Oregon Biodiversity Project engaged a diverse group of scientists, agencies, and policy experts in a 5-year process that developed a statewide biodiversity strategy. The strategy identified 42 areas, where desired ecological attributes converge with political and social circumstances likely to result in beneficial conservation actions. The project also addressed the need for incentives to be used in addition to regulatory strategies to improve the protection of biodiversity across the working landscape. A more coherent framework is needed to deliver incentives efficiently, and to monitor their effectiveness in producing desired results. Clear biodiversity goals are needed to help establish priorities. Four specific ideas are offered to help focus investments and conservation actions: (1) regional habitat conservation plans could be used to help individual landowners meet the requirements of the Endangered Species Act within a broader context; (2) a state management option outlines some ideas about how states might approach biodiversity conservation programs in a holistic way; (3) a proposal for new conservation area designations has the potential to implement sustainable development goals across mixed ownerships; and (4) finally, stewardship agreements are discussed as a tool to integrate individual land management plans into a comprehensive conservation strategy.

AB The biodiversity convention aims at conserving biodiversity and guaranteeing fair and sustainable human use of biodiversity. The convention further requires that the causes of biodiversity decline are identified and evaluated, and that effective conservation and monitoring strategies are developed. Resolving these needs requires a different approach than those described in the last Global Biodiversity Assessment. This assessment tended to be descriptive and did not comprehensively attempt to describe future trends in biodiversity in relation to the major threats: habitat destruction, overexploitation, alien species, pollution and climate change. Integrated assessment modelling and scenario development have therefore not been introduced and applied to assess changes in biodiversity.
   These tools were originally developed for acidification and climate-change impact assessments but are also well suited to analysing other environmental problems. The implemented business-as-usual scenarios show the causes of biodiversity decline to differ regionally. Although complex patterns of causal factors and changes occur in many regions, a valid (but generalised) statement is that climate change causes biodiversity decline in industrialised regions, while in developing regions expanding land use is the major contributor. The scenarios further highlight that despite population growth contributing to the problem, rapidly increasing consumption patterns, rapid expansion of rangelands to support changing diets and too slow-moving technological innovations are major attributes of land-use change and biodiversity decline. Finally, it is concluded that scenario studies transparently highlight the complex systemic interactions and feedback between society and the other components of the earth's system. In addition, scenarios can contribute well to improving the understanding of changes in biodiversity at global and regional levels of assessment. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Do markets lead us to make sustainable choices? If not, why not? And what would we need to do to remedy this? This paper takes a preliminary look at these questions. It identifies three categories of reasons why market choices may not be sustainable, related to valuation of the future, recognition of the benefits provided by environmental assets, and incorrect incentives. It gives examples of cases in which these problems have been corrected, and considers the scope for a more positive relation between market forces and conservation of the environment.

DE biodiversity; environmental economics; incentive measures
AB The conservation or sustainable use of biological diversity presents special challenges for policy-makers because of its complex nature and the difficulties associated with identifying the underlying causes that lead to biodiversity loss. As such, it is often necessary that a range of incentive measures are utilised to ensure both the private and the public benefits of its conservation or sustainable use are realised. Incentive measures available for this purpose include economic incentives (such as taxes, charges, tradable use rights, and subsidies), regulatory measures (such as development or access restrictions), and the provision of relevant information and sufficient institutional capacity. While many of the direct use values of biodiversity are privately appropriable given a clear assignment of property rights and the existence of markets, other financing methods are often necessary for the realisation of other values, such as indirect use values, non-use values and option values. This paper expands the analysis in the Handbook of Incentive Measures for Biodiversity: Design and Implementation (OECD, 1999) developed under the responsibility of the OECD Expert Group on Economic Aspects of Biodiversity to discuss some of the methods available for financing incentive measures for the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity. Where appropriate, case studies of experiences in OECD countries are drawn upon to provide practical examples of the financing and implementation of incentive measures. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

DE biodiversity strategy; certification schemes; incentives; sectoral
   integration; Sweden
AB In Sweden, the maintenance of biological diversity is considered a key element in the development towards a sustainable society. However, the link between sustainable development and biodiversity is far from clear to everybody. It is an important task to explain this link. A cornerstone of Swedish biodiversity policy is that each sector in society has a sectoral responsibility to ensure that its own activities do not cause any long-term loss of biodiversity (but instead help to maintain it). The concept of sectoral responsibility is an important feature of environmental policy in the context of developing new incentives. Besides 'traditional' nature conservation tools - such as the protection of sites, purchasing land and general environmental legislation - new, more market-oriented incentives have emerged during the last few years, e.g. certifications schemes in forestry and eco-labelling in agriculture. These new incentives have developed alongside political processes (parliament, government, agencies etc.) and have been formulated and negotiated by 'market players'. Environmental NGOs, such as WWF Sweden and the Swedish Society for Nature Conservation, have often taken the lead role in this process. Another feature of these incentives is that they not only apply to products but also to production; an example of this is in forestry where not just the wood but also forest management are in focus. The national agri-environmental programmes, within the context of the European Union's subsidy programme for environmental measures in agriculture, provide a powerful tool for conserving and enhancing biodiversity. In Sweden at least, there is nowadays complete acceptance for the basic view that it is both desirable and necessary to pay the farmers for their 'production' of common benefits such as biodiversity in well-managed pastures and meadows. Market-oriented incentives, such as eco-labelling and certification schemes, have an important role to play and should complement other, more traditional tools such as general environmental legislation and protection of sites.

AB This paper examines connections between data-driven models for analyzing a firm's strategic plans, which use activity-based costing and mathematical programming, and the resource-based view of the firm. After brief reviews of the three disciplines, extensions of activity-based costing methods to mathematical programming models for strategic resource planning are discussed. Applications of these models to supply chain planning in a multi-national food manufacturer, a specialty chemicals company, and a wholesaling/retailing company are presented. The paper concludes by using concepts from the resource-based view of the firm to interpret optimal solutions from mathematical programming models. Extensions to strategic planning under uncertainty using stochastic programming are also discussed briefly. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background. In most experimental systems examined, "professional" antigen-presenting cells (APCs), such as dendritic cells, have been found to activate T cells, whereas "nonprofessional" antigen-bearing cells (nonAPC) may induce tolerance. Some recent studies have suggested that nonAPCs may under certain conditions prime a T-cell immune response. We have attempted to separate the roles of transplanted T cells and monocytic/dendritic cells in activating or tolerizing antigen-specific T cells in vivo, by examining the consequences of parenteral exposure to male antigen in anti-male TCR transgenic female mice.
   Methods. Qualitative and quantitative changes in the large population of male-reactive transgenic T cells to various male donor cell populations in transgenic female mice were followed after injections of highly purified male lymphoid cells. Changes in male-reactive T cells with time and the long-term outcome of male skin grafts were measured.
   Results. When a nonAPC population consisting of highly purified male T cells alone was injected intravenously into H-Y antigen-specific TCR transgenic female mice, the number of host transgenic T cells was sustainably increased, and male graft rejection was accelerated. Injection of a combination of purified T cells and purified Mac-1+ cells induced massive and permanent deletion of the host male-reactive T-cell population and permanent graft tolerance. Mac-if cells alone gave no appreciable change in responsive T cells or graft rejection times,
   Conclusions. The data indicate that highly purified T cells engrafted alone induce rapid sensitization toward the male antigen. They also show that both male donor T cells and a population of male monocytic/dendritic cells are required to induce peripheral tolerance toward this antigen and that this tolerance is related to permanent peripheral deletion of male-reactive T cells.

AB Threshold runoff is the amount of excess rainfall accumulated during a given time period over a basin that is just enough to cause flooding at the outlet of the draining stream. Threshold runoff estimates are indicators of maximal sustainable surface runoff for a given catchment, and are thus an essential component of flash flood warning systems. Used in conjunction with soil moisture accounting models and areal rainfall data, they form the basis of the US National Weather Service (NWS) flash flood watch/warning program. As part of their modernization and enhancement effort, the NWS determined that improved flash flood guidance and thus improved threshold runoff estimation is needed across the United States, with spatial resolution commensurate to that afforded by the WSR-88D (NEXRAD) radars. In this work, Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and digital terrain elevation databases have been used to develop a national system for determining threshold runoff. Estimates of threshold runoff an presented for several locations in the United States, including large portions of the states of Iowa, Oklahoma, and California, and using several options in computing threshold runoff. Analysis of the results indicates the importance of channel geometry in flash flood applications. Larger threshold runoff estimates were computed in Oklahoma (average value of 34 mm) than in Iowa (14 mm) or California (9.5 mm). Comparisons of the threshold runoff estimates produced by the GIS procedure with those based on manually computed unit hydrographs for the selected catchments are shown as a preliminary measure of the accuracy of the procedure. Differences of up to about 15 mm for hourly rainfall durations were obtained for basins larger than 50 km(2). (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

DE rainfed lowland rice; farmers' knowledge; sustainability; Tanzania
AB Recent agricultural surveys conducted in Sukumaland, Tanzania, drew attention to the importance of rainfed, lowland rice in the studied farming systems. Information from these surveys is used to provide the first detailed description of rice cultivation in Sukumaland. Such a description is needed for a better understanding of the level of importance, the current performance, and the future possibilities of this rice cultivation system.
   More than a third of rice produced in Tanzania comes from Sukumaland. Farmers increased their rice production quickly when rice cultivation became more profitable in comparison to cotton and other crops. Smaller farm sizes because of increasing population densities also made rice mon popular as a food crop, because of its capability to produce high amounts of calories on small pieces of land. Farmers' innovations, experimentations and agricultural knowledge developed this bonded rainfed lowland rice system in Sukumaland as a way to secure the sustainability of their farming systems. It turned a semi-arid environment into a rice exporting area. Rice management practices follow closely differences in ecology and household characteristics. Selection of rice cultivars is largely determined by water conditions in the field.
   Future research and extension on rainfed lowland rice in Sukumaland as well as in other parts of Tanzania and Africa will benefit from a proper description of rice cultivation, which includes farmers' knowledge and diversity at the level of household, rice valley and rice field.

ID TOURISM
AB Case study research of community tourism planning in the developing world rarely focuses on the combined effects of history, markets, culture, legislation, and politics. This case study of Boracay Island, Philippines suggests that understanding these contextual factors is essential for sustainable tourism development. The research led to the conclusion that better planning based on a broad systematic assessment should be coupled with improved governance to move from knowledge to implementation. Better governance should clearly delineate local, regional and national roles and incorporate community input to mitigate against the adverse effects of tourism development while maximizing benefits. The lessons learned have implications for tourism throughout the developing world. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The paper investigates whether departures from government borrowing constraints affect the relationship between fiscal-policy innovations and changes in the investment level. 'Break points', or apparent departures from present-value budget balance, are then identified. Next, the investment-deficit relationship is examined prior to and following identified break points in an effort to detect potential changes in behaviour. The investment-deficit relationship is quantified by examining posterior coverage bounds of impulse response functions. Britain appears to undergo such a break around 1973. Data from this country suggest that significantly more crowding out occurred following the identified breaks: in contrast, data from other comparison countries that do not appear to have experienced breaks indicate stable investment-deficit relationships.

AB Since 1992 research on the Badia Programme, in north-east Jordan, has begun the process of identifying constraints on development and is suggesting where developmental potential still exists. Still, there are no proven development options to set alongside the traditional pastoralism. Perhaps in the future, service industries will provide the main additional employment opportunities, especially those serving the needs of international trade to and from Iraq and further east.

AB Over-abstraction of groundwater is one concern of the Badia Research and Development Programme. The upper aquifer of the Azraq basin forms the largest resource of good-quality water, but current abstraction exceeds both average recharge and the safe yield of the aquifer, which is over-exploited. Although there has been no deterioration in water quality and only minor drawdown, the springs at Azraq have dried up, with severe, undesirable environmental impacts. Total abstraction of 20 x 10(6) m(3) yr(-1) appears to be sustainable and would allow some springflow, but this leaves a shortfall of 40 x 10(6) m(3) yr(-1) for domestic supply and agriculture.

AB Rekawa Lagoon, Sri Lanka (area 250 ha) has an artisanal fishery for penaeid shrimp, predominantly Penaeus indicus (93.6% of catch), but with small numbers (0.8%) of Penaeus monodon. Neither species breeds in the lagoon; larvae and post-larvae enter the lagoon: during brief periods in July and November (P. indicus) or just November (Pen. monodon) when a sand bar blocking the lagoon entrance is breached. Detailed information on fishery characteristics was collected during the fishing season of 1995-1996. The P. indicus fishery began in October, peaked in February and was over by late April/early May; while Pen. monodon was only caught from March to early May. The fishery was extremely intensive, removing virtually all shrimp by early May. In the light of these data, two stock enhancement exercises were carried out with Pen. monodon post-larvae in July 1996 (55,000 post-larvae) and July 1997 (70,000 post-larvae). These led subsequently to commercial catches of Pen. monodon from September to January (roughly 6 months out of phase with the natural fishery) in both years. Total catch in 1996-1997 represented 3.5% of the number of post-larvae released. In 1996-1997, the total shrimp catch was worth 33% more than in 1995-1996, while the annual Pen. monodon catch was enhanced by 1400%. Economic analysis and scenario modelling were used to evaluate the biological and economic feasibility of more intensive stock enhancement. This study represents an ecologically and economically sustainable penaeid stock enhancement approach by which shrimp aquaculture and artisanal fishing can cc-exist. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Objective: To assess the sustainable benefits of a professional, multidisciplinary training program for patients with rheumatoid arthritis.
   Design: Two studies with different observation periods. Study I was a prospective, randomized trial for 1 year. Study II was a noncontrolled observation over 5 years.
   Setting: The 9-day program for eight patient groups encompassed a multidisciplinary cooperation between rheumatologists, orthopedists, physicotherapists, psychologists and social workers.
   Patients: Sixty-eight consecutive patients with rheumatoid arthritis participated in an arthritis training program either immediately after enrollment in the program or after 1 year.
   Interventions: The program covered the following fields: pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis, drug therapy, physicotherapy, practical exercise in remedial gymnastics, use of joint protection devices, orthopedic perspectives, psychological counseling, dietetics, information about unproven cures and social assistance.
   Main Outcome Measures: Clinical outcome was assessed by self-report questionnaires: (1) Stanford Health Assessment Questionnaire, (2) Freiburg Questionnaire of Coping with Illness, (3) Beck Depression Inventory, and (4) a 21-point scale to evaluate cognitive-behavioral and environmental impact.
   Results: A significant and persistent improvement of all investigated parameters was demonstrated in the 1-year controlled trial. Between the end-point of the 1-year study and the 5-year evaluation, this improvement increased even more for functional status and coping with illness, whereas depression returned to baseline values. These effects were seen even without reinforcement of the training.
   Conclusion: A professional, multidisciplinary approach to educate patients with rheumatoid arthritis leads to a significant and sustained improvement of the clinical outcome and is an approach that should be established as a part of conventional therapy.

DT Article
DE causes and types of soil degradation; databases; global assessment
AB Soil is a valuable natural resource that in the short-term is nonrenewable and is difficult to reclaim when degraded. The use of soils on a sustainable basis requires that their capability to withstand the demands upon them is not exceeded. Those people concerned with conservation should be aware of the vital importance of soil for maintaining food supplies for an increasing world population. Increasing demands place a greater strain upon the soil. If the demands become too great, the soil becomes degraded. As soil is the basis of all terrestrial ecosystems, a degraded soil means lower fertility, reduced biodiversity, and human poverty. To provide basic information on soil degradation worldwide, a survey of soil loss through erosion, physical deterioration, and chemical pollution was made. Digital databases are not available to hold information necessary to monitor and combat soil degradation at global and national scales. Soil degradation is recognized as a serious and widespread problem, so in September 1987 the International Soil Reference and Information Centre was commissioned to make a survey for a map at a scale of 1 :10,000,000 entitled "Global Assessment of Human-Induced Soil Degradation" (GLASOD). Until it was published in 1990, there was no uniformly collected body of information on soil degradation worldwide. The GLASOD survey provides basic data on the world distribution and intensity of erosional, chemical, and physical types of degradation. The original purpose of GLASOD was to provide factual information, to replace sweeping statements about soil and land degradation, and to raise awareness of policy makers and governments for the continuing need for soil conservation. The GLASOD survey also enables comparisons to be drawn between degraded soils of different continents, and the methodology used can be a basis upon which plans for restoration of degraded lands can be based.

It directly affects those involved in conservation, exploitation and investigation of biodiversity in all its forms, as well as affecting the viability of all life. Australia is one of more than 170 countries that have ratified the Convention. Its involvement in this Convention will be considered in terms of the National Strategy for the Conservation of Biological Diversity with a focus on the coverage of microorganisms within this strategy. Microorganisms represent a major part of the biodiversity on Earth but, as yet, remain relatively unknown. Among those microorganisms that have been described, many, originating from a range of countries, have been deposited in culture collections worldwide. The Convention contains articles that impact on ex situ collections, although precise protocols are not set out therein. An international code of conduct is now being formulated to ensure ongoing access to and exchange of microorganisms in the interests of sustainable development in industrialised and developing nations.

   association of sport and medicine; National Sports Medicine Institute
AB Objectives-To assess the training and interest of a group of general practitioners in the area of sport and exercise medicine, and the organisations representing the specialty.
   Design-A postal questionnaire using a Likert scale in a previously piloted set of questions.
   Subjects-275 general practitioners registered with the Northampton Regional Health Authority.
   Main outcome measurements-Responses to questions designed to assess training and interest in sport and exercise medicine.
   Results-A response rate of 87.6% was achieved. It was found that 72.7% of the responding general practitioners felt inadequately trained to practice sport and exercise medicine. Some 76.0% would welcome more training and 36.4% felt that their undergraduate orthopaedic training was of no use in primary care. Many (63.6%) of the general practitioners believed that the current NHS cannot sustain sport and exercise medicine, and there was uncertainty as to whether it is currently a recognised specialty, although 60.4% felt that it should be. General practitioners Listed lack of facilities (53.1%), lack of training (42.9%), and lack of time (38.2%) as the main problems in practicing sport and exercise medicine in primary care within the current NHS.
   Conclusions-General practitioners feel undertrained in sport and exercise medicine at both undergraduate and postgraduate level; they have a perceived need for more training and show an interest in the subject. There is scope for improving the value of undergraduate orthopaedic training. General practitioners wish to see sport and exercise medicine recognised as an NHS specialty but fear that this is not sustainable under current conditions. There is confusion among general practitioners about the current sport and exercise medicine organisations.

AB Various sources of uncertainty have greatly impeded the effectiveness of traditional fisheries management to assure acceptable levels of sustainability of fisheries and species populations. Marine protected areas are receiving increasing consideration and show potential as a means of contributing to the sustainability of populations and guarding against fishery failures. Marine protected areas take advantage of the open population structure that characterizes most exploited benthic marine species by considering the pelagic dispersal of propagules and the patchy distribution of benthic habitat. Because protected areas have only recently been considered for west coast fisheries, because poorly designed reserves may be useless and possibly detrimental, and because optimal design criteria are not yet understood, incorporating the evaluation of empirically derived design criteria into the final implementation of protected area networks (i.e., adaptive management) is the only prudent approach.

ID GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION-SYSTEMS
AB Catchment resources, generated from multi-source data (remotely-sensed, map- and groundbased systems), were input to a raster-based Geographical Information Systems (GIS) after geometrically co-registered to a standard grid (pixel). The GIS used was the PC-based, indigenously-developed package, called GRAM (Geo-Referenced Area Management). A set of knowledge-based rules, for assessing the soil erosion of this heterogeneous hilly catchment, were formulated from the knowledge of the multi-disciplinary resource-experts and the knowledge of the local catchment resources, in addition to the field observations. This rule-based model, which is hopefully fast and cost-effective and without effect of the individual bias, helped in inferring the erosion intensity units that most likely to occur at any given pixel in the system. Finally, the catchment was grouped into four different erosion intensity units namely very severe, severe, moderate to severe and slight to moderate. The quantitative soil loss (t ha(-1) year(-1)) ranges, estimated by USLE model by a spatial information analysis approach (GIS), were also computed: (a) Very severe (> 50): (b) Severe (40-50); (c) Moderate to severe (20-40); and (d) Slight to moderate (< 20). An integrated priority delineation survey, for taking up soil/water conservation measures by Sediment Yield Index model, carried out in the catchment grouped the catchment into very high, high, medium and low priority classes. Apparently, the areal extent of high and moderate priority classes occupy about 80% of the catchment, which is closely following the areal extent of severe and moderate to severe erosion intensity unit categories by this rule-based model. The outcome of the results of this study will be immensely useful to monitor the dynamic changes in the catchment environment. The soil erosion information system thus generated, identifies the targeted problem areas for conservation planning and sustainable development of the catchment. Although it is an early airing of results obtained from this rule-based model, the introduction of multi-disciplinary expert's informed opinion may provide an extension to the traditional methods of assessing the soil erosion status/magnitude which should enable and/or evaluate different catchment management scenarios.

AB The main aim of this article is to put forward various factors, forces, and decisions which have diversified the tendency of urban growth and which have shaped the urban pattern of the city of Gazimagusa (Famagusta)(1) particularly after the war in 1974, and to offer alternative policy recommendations, some strategic planning solutions including general design proposals, These are aimed at dealing with the major problems posed by the fragmentation of the urban fabric, It stresses the post-war tendency and problems of urban growth and development, by addressing the social, cultural and demographic, as well as economic and physical changes the city has been facing since then.
   The paper begins with a brief historical review of the evolution of the urban pattern of the city until 1974 and identifies its urban layout at that time. With the arguments in place, the paper will then provide a framework for understanding and solving the urban problems in the city after 1974 and try to evaluate the positive and negative issues, factors and/or forces which have been shaping its urban structure. Finally, some policy recommendations for planning and design solutions are provided as a basis for the integration of developing, neglected and deteriorated quarters of the city. Particular emphasis is made on the Walled City, Maras (Varosha), Asagi Maras (Kato Varosha)(2) as well as the newly developed and developing quarters, which are bringing the city towards sustainable development.

ID COMPARATIVE PERSPECTIVE; HOUSING POLICY; EUROPE; PRAGUE
AB Cities, and in particular historic cities, are recognised as valuable resources within the increasingly competitive and integrated European economy. This paper focuses on the experiences of two such cities, Edinburgh and Prague, contrasting different approaches in local planning and urban regeneration policy. Edinburgh, Like other western European capitalist cities, has a long tradition of strategic planning and policy making, engaging with a broad range of policy stakeholders and local interest groups. In contrast, the city of Prague highlights some of the difficulties faced by post-socialist cities as they adapt to the economic forces of the European Union and globalisation. Limited attention has been given to how post-socialist cities have managed to come to terms with such forces and reconcile competing national and local trends. In the paper, key issues identified in Prague refer to the fragmentation of local government, the lengthy nature of re-establishing property ownership and procedural difficulties with the planning system. These problems have effectively hindered the formulation of a strategic framework for future urban planning, and have led to a lack of co-operation between decision makers in the city. The comparison between the experiences of east and west clearly highlights the necessity of re-focusing on the relationship between the planning system and its specific context of governance structures. Planning historic cities is a necessary factor to ensure that sustainable development is achievable, and to secure an advantageous position within the emerging European hierarchy. Post-socialist cities can do more by learning from the experience of urban Europe, as East looks West. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

This ongoing study is based on the identification and analysis of natural and human effects on Saloum Biosphere Reserve (Senegal), which is also a Ramsar Wetland area. This article points out a few nonrestrictive orientations for integrated management of the protected area and its surroundings. The main objectives of the current management plan are:
   a permanent monitoring process of the natural resources,
   training and information about the positive effects of a sustainable conservation strategy,
   setting up strategies that could improve the living standards of local communities, and
   promotion of an institutional framework for better management of the biosphere reserve with all actors' participation.

ID MANAGEMENT; GROWTH; STAND
AB The forest rotations problem has been considered by generations of economists (Fisher, 1930; Boulding, 1966; Samuelson, 1976). Traditionally, the forest resource across all future harvest periods is assumed to grow without memory of past harvest periods. This paper integrates economic theory and intertemporal ecological mechanics, linking current harvest decisions with future forest growth, financial value, and ecosystem health. Results and implications of a non-renewable forest resource and the influence of rotation length and number on forest recovery are reported. Cost estimates of moving from short-term economic rotations to long-term ecological rotations suggest the level of incentive required for one aspect of ecosystem management. A net private cost of maintaining ecosystem health emerges and, for public policy purposes, can be compared with measures of non-timber amenity values and social benefits exhibiting increasing returns to rotation length.

ID INDUSTRIAL ECOLOGY; ECOSYSTEMS
AB A brief accounting is presented of the evolution of natural ecosystems and human cultures including industrialization and its ecologically-significant interactions with natural abiotic and biotic processes of the earth. These accounts show, among other things, that excess resource harvest rates and material releases into the natural environment have been ecological risks of growing scope and scale throughout the history of political economies. The growing ecological risks of industrialization are attributed to disparities between the rates and directions of evolution in the ecological features of process and structure of corporate and political economies relative to the rates and directions of evolution in their cultural institutions of control. Many social and political organizations are now calling for adaptations toward sustainable industrialization by promoting evolution in the cultural institutions of control through research, education, ethics, politics and government. What is required are on-line institutional processes for effectively translating emerging ecological risk assessments into economic incentives for feasible adaptations throughout the systems. Institutionalization of such on-line adaptive processes requires broad moral-ethical enlightenment and social-political commitment to make the emerging scientific, technological and economic dimensions productive (Faber et al., 1996). This paper presents on-line strategies of ecological risk assessment and control which are believed to be superior to alternatives that require a prior consensus on economic valuations of natural resource stocks, natural processes and environmental damages; and incentives have advantages over prescriptive regulations. When viewed in their greater economic context, the proposed strategies are formulated as coordinated institutions of on-line ecological and fiscal control processes on what is here defined as the ecological economies of corporate and political economies. The objective of the proposed control strategies is to pursue trajectories of joint ecological and cultural evolution toward systems that are ecologically and culturally both satisfying and sustainable.

AB The problem of managing for sustainability is marked by the need to make decisions on behalf of others and by the uncertainties that attend such decisions. However, the economic literature on sustainability has paid scant attention to how decisions on behalf of others might differ from decisions on behalf of oneself. And, when risk has been modeled explicitly, the expected utility hypothesis has generally been used: a generation acts sustainably if the expected value of the next generation's utility is not less than the present's. This paper investigates how we think about responsibly acting on another's behalf by looking to the United States law of trusts because in important respects the current generation views its responsibility to the future as a trust relationship. Trust law illuminates responsible decision making under both risk and uncertainty. Even under conditions of risk more conservative action than would be suggested by the expected utility hypothesis is warranted. Because it emphasizes preservation of trust principal and disavows profit maximization, trust doctrine indicates that special caution should be exercised in conditions of uncertainty. Finally, resource economic concepts of strong sustainability, the precautionary principle, and the safe minimum standard of conservation are interpreted according to trust principles.

DE non-wood forest products; orchids; sustainability; international trade;
   nature conservation; species protection
AB The use of salep (ground orchid bulbs) has a long history in Turkey. The analysis of its trade, revealed that it is still used there as medicine, drink and as binder in so-called Maras Ice cream. Substitutes, however; increasingly enter, the market. Export figures unfortunately do not distinguish between tore salep and substitutes. The officially recorded Turkish export of 75 100 kg salep in 1993 almost certainly refers more to substitutes than to true salep. Major countries of destination are Germany the Netherlands, and northern Cyprus. Drug importers in Germany have imported tote salep for medicinal purposes for years, CITES documents were not applied for and not issued. Five medicines containing true salep could be identified on the German market for medicinal products. It is estimated that about 10-20 million orchid bulbs are collected annually in Turkey. Information to the impact of such a harvest on the population status on the species concerned are somehow contradictory. Recommendations are made for a better control of salep trade, for reducing the use of genuine salep and for better protection of orchid populations in Turkey.

ID ZIMBABWE
AB Pedistylis galpinii and Erianthemum dregei produce woodrose outgrowths at attachment points with host trees. In some rural areas of southern Africa, woodroses are sold as curies. The socio-economics related to woodrose harvesters were investigated via interview schedules and field survey. Harvesting is nor detrimental to hosts as only branches infected with mistletoes are cut. Over half the harvesters interviewed reported harvesting both live and dead mistletoes while 20% used only dead ones. The density of dead mistletoes could satisfy present demand Such sustainable harvesting practices (only using dead woodroses) allow for woodrose harvesting according to calculated quotas. The median gross income per month generated from woodroses was estimated to be between US $38 and 90. Eleven percent of harvesters relied on woodroses as their only source of income. Marketing was relatively haphazard, involving informal selling at roadsides and unscheduled visits to retailers. The market for woodroses can be expanded and the potential exists to increase supply considerably on a sustainable basis.

AB Building on recent statements calling for greater emphasis on the roles of organized actors and civil society in development research, in this paper we analyze the utility of themes raised in current debates on social capital for pursuing such lines of inquiry. In particular, we develop a framework for linking social capital to discussions of sustainability, resource access, and livelihoods. The framework understands the sustainability of livelihoods and local economies in two dimensions: patterns of access to produced, human, natural, and social capital; and the role of social capital formation at different geographic scales in facilitating rural peoples' access to other forms of capital, both directly and through engaging with state, market, and other civil society actors. We then use the framework to discuss a case from highland Ecuador. The case study illustrates the ways in which social capital, in the form of community, federated, and national indigenous peoples organizations and their institutional networks, has been built through four decades of external intervention. It also traces the various ways in which this social capital formation has widened household and community access to financial, natural, and human capital. In doing so it draws out some of the links among social capital formation, livelihood development, political change, and landscape transformation. The approach has implications for development, social movements, and political ecological research.

DT Article
ID BIOMASS; STOVES
AB An inventory of biofuel combustion is used to develop estimates of the emissions of carbon-containing greenhouse gases (CO2, CO, CH4, and NMHC) in Asian countries. It is estimated that biofuels contributed 573 Tg-C (teragrams of carbon; 1 Tg = 10(12) g) in 1990, about 28% of the total carbon emissions from energy use in Asia. China (259 Tg-C) and India (187 Tg-C) were the largest emitting countries. The majority of the emissions, 504 Tg-C, were in the form of CO2; however, emissions of non-CO2 greenhouse gases were significant: 57 Tg-C as CO, 6.4 Tg-C as CH4, and 5.9 Tg-C as NMHC. Because of the high rates of incomplete combustion in typical biofuel stoves and cookers and the high global warming potentials (GWP) of the products of incomplete combustion (PICs), biofuels comprise an even larger share of energy-related emissions when measured in terms of total GWP (in CO2 equivalents): 38% over a 20-year time horizon and 31% over a 100-year time horizon. Even when the biofuel is assumed to be harvested on a completely sustainable basis tall CO2 emissions reabsorbed in the following growing season), PIC emissions from biofuel combustion account for 4.5% of the total carbon emissions and 23% of CO2 equivalents on a short-term (20-year) GWP basis.

AB In this work the authors, after a brief outlook concerning the markets of main energy commodities, propose an alternative mechanism for fuel pricing consisted with a sustainable development. Technological change and technological pluralism, costs and environmental issues are the benchmarks of the discussion developed. The two mechanisms here proposed for fuel pricing try to encompass all these aspects stressing the scarcity concern, not only under a merely-based resource point of view, but emphasizing also the technological variable as the first one to take into consideration. In fact, technology, the mean by which resources are transformed into usable services (energy forms), is strictly linked to its limits (above all productivity, efficiency and environmental effects) and cannot be any more considered only following the classical principles of the lowest cost of utilization without evaluating the other aspects related to the goals of sustainable development, widely shared at the international level. Furthermore, taking into consideration that some estimates of petroleum life expectancy calculate about 40-50 yr of consumption (at current rates of demand), a new mechanism to consider the right value of this resource (and, consequently, all energy commodities) is necessary. Without any pretension of exhaustion of the topic, this work seems to be in line with this perspective, trying to apply all these principles to price fuels. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB In Turkey illegal cutting takes place, which cannot be controlled. Legal cuttings have also been done by several state forest enterprises. As a result, the amount of wood raw material produced by forest enterprises legally and by forest villagers illegally has exceeded the potential capacity of the forest. According to the research related to Macka and other Turkish state forests, the state forests have been decreasing day by dal,. This is because the amount of wood raw material taken from the forests has exceeded the production potential of the forest. That study concluded that the Macka and other Turkish forests will be exhausted after 64 and 67 years, respectively. This study also examined both establishing and exploiting energy forests near the forest villages and producing fuel briquettes manufactured using the residues of agriculture, forestry and stock bleeding to diminish the demand for illegal fuel wood cutting from the state forests.

AB This paper describes the innovations required from companies, local authorities and national governments to make manufacturing industry contribute to sustainable development in cities. It argues that the urban dimension has often been overlooked in discussions on industry and sustainable development, with most attention focusing on the roles of the individual firm and/or national policy in achieving change. The paper then presents a series of examples to demonstrate how industry will need to become responsible not only for the social and environmental performance of its own production activities but also for the sourcing of raw material inputs "upstream" and for the emissions and waster that its products generate "downstream".

TI Voluntary recycling in Quito: factors associated with participation in a
   pilot programme
SO ENVIRONMENT AND URBANIZATION
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper describes a pilot recycling programme ill Quito and the factors associated with residents' participation in separating their wastes. This municipal programme extended garbage collection to previously unserved neighbourhoods micro-enterprises formed by residents which provided separate collection services (on different days) for organic (compostable), recyclable and non-recyclable wastes, and delivered these to municipal depots. The revenues from the sale of recyclables went to funds to support neighbourhood improvements. A combination of focus group discussions, in-depth interviews and a household survey identified the steps that would have to be taken to increase and sustain residents' separation of wastes - for instance, a more reliable collection service, more evidence that the finds generated were being used for neighbourhood improvement and a better information system about the programme. The research also highlighted two other issues. The first was the need for better integration between recycling programmes and existing informal waste collection systems. The second tons the importance of involving programme beneficiaries in the design of local development interventions, such as the recycling programme analyzed here, for them to be sustainable.

TI Interaction between scientists and nonscientists in community-based
   watershed management: Emergence of the concept of stream naturalization
SO ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE community-based decision making; watershed management; stream
   naturalization
ID SUSTAINABILITY; CONSTRUCTION; ILLINOIS
AB Watershed management, although dependent on science and engineering, is first and foremost a social process. Given the current emphasis on community-based approaches to environmental decisionmaking, scientists must, more than ever before, understand, appreciate, respect, and immerse themselves within local social contexts. Only by doing so wilt they be able to ensure that their opinions and information are fairly and meaningfully considered by nonscientists.
   The authors' personal experience in watershed planning and decision making in the agricultural Midwest is described to illustrate how: (1) formalization of the process of community-based management is not sufficient to guarantee that local people will meaningfully consider scientific information and opinion when making decisions about watersheds. and (2) genuine social interaction between scientists and nonscientists requires a considerable investment of time and energy on the part of he scientist to develop personal relationships with nonscientists based on trust and mutual exchange of information. This experience provides the basis for developing a general conceptual model of the interaction between scientists and nonscientists in community-based watershed management in the agricultural Midwest.
   An important aspect of integrating science effectively into community-based decision making is the need to revise existing concepts to accommodate place-based contexts. Stream naturalization is introduced as an alternative to stream restoration and rehabilitation, which are viewed as inappropriate management strategies in human-dominated environments. Stream naturalization seeks to establish sustainable, morphologically and hydraulically varied, yet dynamically stable fluvial systems that are capable of supporting healthy, biologically diverse aquatic ecosystems. This general goal is consistent with the types of stream-management practices emerging from community-based decision making in human-dominated, agricultural landscapes. Further research on the linkages between geomorphological and ecological dynamics of human-modified agricultural streams over multiple spatial and temporal scales is needed to provide a sound scientific framework for stream naturalization.

SO ENVIRONMENTAL & RESOURCE ECONOMICS

DE mangrove management; multicriteria analysis; sustainability; valuation
ID MANAGEMENT REGIMES
AB Mangrove ecosystems are rapidly declining in many parts of the world. This has resulted in the loss of important environmental and economic products and services including forest products, flood mitigation and nursery grounds for fish. The aquaculture industry was the single biggest threat to mangroves in the Philippines until 1981 when conversion of the remaining mangrove stands was prohibited by law. However, the decreasing yield from capture fisheries is putting pressure for the re-examination of this policy. To understand the importance of mangroves, insight is needed into the value of products and services provided is needed. This article compares the costs and benefits of mangrove preservation with those generated by alternative uses such as aquaculture and forestry. Equity and sustainability objectives are taken into account, in addition to economic efficiency and analyzed according to the perspectives of the different types of decision makers involved.

LA English
DT Article
DE dispersal; harvesting theory; population harvesting; population
   management; population stability; source-sink dynamics
ID NATURAL-POPULATIONS; DYNAMICS
AB We derive optimal harvesting strategies for a single population in a simple two-habitat environment. We let one of the habitats function as a source with logistic population growth and the other habitat as a sink that cannot have positive equilibrium population density without immigration from the source. The dispersal between habitats is assumed to be density-independent and cost-free. The total yield function for simultaneous harvesting in the two habitats has no interior extreme point. Given that maximum sustainable yield is the management goal (not necessarily a very wise one), two possible harvesting policies emerge. Either the sink should be harvested at its optimal rate (provided that the yield function has a maximum), or the sink should be harvested at a maximal rate and the source at its optimal rate. In the former case, the yield from the sink always exceeds the yield from the source; in the latter case, the reverse is often, but not always, true. The relationship between maximum per capita growth rate in the source and the dispersal parameters determine which of the above two cases applies. Regardless of harvesting strategy, or if we harvest at all, the sink often has the highest population density. Harvesting the sink will always result in the highest yield. Both source and sink harvesting generally destabilize the dynamics of the total population. Although sources and sinks are real, it may be impossible to distinguish between them in the field. Our results are, therefore, not directly or easily applied to real harvesting situations. Given that there are habitat quality differences of the source-sink kind, however, harvesting decisions may result in unexpected and unwanted outcomes that population management should take into account.

ID ACID SANDY SOIL; FERTILITY CONSTRAINTS; CROP PRODUCTION; LONG-TERM;
   NITROGEN
AB The main objective of this study was to determine the best soil amendment and tillage practices for sustainable miller yield and grain and stover quality. The treatments included tillage practices (immediate-, late- and no-till) and soil amendments (sheep manure plus urine, manure, millet stover (stalks, leaf blades and leaf sheaths) and miller stover ash) in factorial combinations with fertilizer nitrogen levels of 0, 15 and 30 kg ha(-1) plus controls. Results showed that (i) higher yields were obtained in tilled plots than in no-tin plots; (ii) tillage timing may nor be a significant yield determining factor; (iii) the application of animal urine resulted in significantly higher yield and greater nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium uptake than the application either of manure alone or of miller stover. Urine application (ruminant urine contains virtually no phosphorus), which elevates soil pH especially during the first week after application, may have resulted in the dissolution of phosphorus from the aluminium-iron complexes of kaolinitic clays. This is corroborated by the significantly higher phosphorus uptake from the manure-plus-urine plots than from plots amended with either manure alone or miller stover. Long-term implications of 'mining' soil phosphorus with repeated applications of animal urine in these fragile ecosystems remains unclear.

AB Vertic Inceptisols are prone to land degradation because of excessive run-off and soil erosion during the rainy season. Productivity of soybean-based systems on these soils needs to be improved and sustained by better management of natural resources, particularly soil and water. During 1995-1997 a field study was conducted in Peninsular India on a Vertic Inceptisol watershed to study the effect of two soil depths, namely shallow (<50 cm soil depth) and medium-deep (greater than or equal to 50 cm soil depth) and two landform treatments, namely flat and broadbed-and-furrow (BBF) systems, on productivity and resource-use efficiency of soybean-chickpea rotation (soybean in rainy season followed by chickpea in post-rainy season). Soybean grown on flat landform on medium-deep soil had a higher leaf area index and more light interception compared to the soybean grown on the BBF landform. This resulted in an increase in mean seed yield for the flat landform (2120 kg ha(-1)) compared to the BBF landform (1870 kg ha(-1)). However, the landform treatments on shallow soil did not affect soybean yields. The soybean yield was higher on the medium-deep soil (1760 kg ha(-1)) than on the shallow soil (1550 kg ha(-1)) during 1995-1996, but were not different during 1996-1997. In both years chickpea yields and total system productivity (soybean + chickpea yields) were greater on medium-deep soil than on the shallow soil. Total run-off was higher on the flat landform (25% of seasonal rainfall) than on the BBF landform (20% of seasonal rainfall). This concomitantly increased profile water contend (10-30 mm) of both soils in BBF compared to the flat landform treatment during 1995-1996, but not during 1996-1997. Deep drainage was higher in the BBF landform than in flat, especially for the shallow soil. Across landforms and soil depths, water use (evapotranspiration) by soybean-chickpea rotation during 1996-1997 ranged from 496 to 563 mm, which accounted for 54-61% of the rainfall. These results indicate that while the BBF system is useful in decreasing run-off and increasing infiltration of rainfall on Vertic Inceptisols, there is a need to increase light use by soybean on BBF during the rainy season to increase its productivity. A watershed-based farming system needs to be adopted to capture significant amount of rain water lost as run-off and deep drainage. The stored water can be used for supplemental irrigation to increase productivity of soybean-based systems leading to overall increases in resource-use efficiency, crop productivity, and sustainability.

AB Natural mortality was estimated for Rhizoprionodon taylori by using seven indirect methods based on relationships between mortality and life history parameters and one direct method, catch curve analysis. Estimated values from indirect methods were 0.60 to 1.65, whereas catch curves produced values of 0.56 for females and 0.70 for males. Demographic analysis was undertaken by using standard life history table techniques. Life history tables where each of the seven indirect estimates of natural mortality for R. taylori produced intrinsic rates of natural increase from -1.297 to 0.212 for an unfished population, and only two of the seven produced positive population growth. The implications of these results are discussed in relation to the accuracy of indirect methods for estimating natural mortality far R. taylori and other species of shark. The catch curve method was considered the best estimate of natural mortality and gave an intrinsic rate of increase of 0.27 and a doubling time of 2.55 years. The results of life history table analysis with the estimate of natural mortality from the catch curve analysis indicated that a R. taylori- population could sustain fishing mortality up to 0.18 if applied evenly over all age classes, or 0.67 if age at first capture was two years. The implications of this study are discussed in relation to sustainability of elasmobranch stocks, particularly short-lived, fast growing, early maturing species.

AB 1. The daily energy expenditure of free-living adult male Wood Mice, Apodemus sylvaticus, from deciduous woodland and maritime sand-dune was estimated using the doubly labelled water (DLW) technique and time-energy budget models.
   2. Method of calculation had a small effect on the calculated energy demands. There were no significant differences in energy expenditure across sites or seasons despite large differences in home range among mice from different sites. Mice in winter, and on the sand-dunes, had lower body masses, which offset the effects of larger home ranges and colder temperatures.
   3. The daily energy expenditure for a Wood Mouse of mean body mass (20.5 g) was 67.9 kJ day(-1) (n = 19) This was comparable to other similar size rodents (slightly higher), and did not deviate significantly from allometric predictions.
   4. Variation in daily energy expenditure among individuals was not explained by ambient temperature, home range size, body mass, change in body mass, time spent active and the distance or speed of travel.
   5. Sustainable metabolic rates approximated to five times basal metabolism and were within the range previously reported but higher than most other estimates of free-living energy demands.
   6. Rates of water influx and efflux were significantly greater for Wood Mice on the sand-dunes (influx, 9.3 +/- 1.14 ml day(-1), efflux, 10.2 +/- 1.10 ml day(-1)) than for animals in the woodland (influx, 6.3 +/- 0.48 mi day(-1), efflux, 6.2 +/- 0.47 ml day(-1)). This was probably due to differences in the water content of their diets (seed in woodland and invertebrate on the sand-dunes).
   7. The time-energy budget models yielded estimates of energy expenditure considerably lower than the doubly labelled water estimate. Potential reasons for this discrepancy are discussed.

AB Programming tools that are simultaneously sustainable, highly functional, robust and easy to use have been hard to come by in the HPCC arena. This is partially due to the difficulty in developing sophisticated customized systems for what is a relatively small part of the worldwide computing enterprise. Thus, we have developed a new strategy - termed High Performance Commodity Computing (HPCC) [G. Fox, W. Furmanski, HPCC as high performance commodity computing, in: I. Foster, C. Kesselman (Eds.), Building National Grid, http://www.npac.syr.edu/users/gcf/HPcc/HPcc.html] - which builds HPCC programming tools on top of the remarkable new software infrastructure being built for the commercial web and distributed object areas. We add high performance to commodity systems using multi-tier architecture with Globus metacomputing toolkit as the backend of a middle-tier of commodity web and object servers. We have demonstrated the fully functional prototype of WebFlow during Alliance'98 meeting. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The next Olympic Games are to be held in Sydney, Australia, in the year 2000. In examining the extensive preparations now, being made, this article provides a case study of the way, in which planning for 'hallmark' events can produce significant urban changes and new development. The Sydney Games are of particular inter-est because, for the first rime, Olympic planning is taking on an environmental dimension. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has signalled a strong concern for the environment and a desire to apply concepts such as sustainable urban development. However, the extent to which Sydney Olympics are, in practice, likely, to live up to these 'green' aspirations remains a matter of dispute.

AB Secondary infection of roots by fungal pathogens is a primary cause of vine damage in phylloxera-infested grapevines (Vitis vinifera L.). In summer and fall surveys in 1997 and 1998, grapevine root samples were taken from organically (OMVs) and convectionally managed vineyards (CMVs), all of which were phylloxera-infested. In both gears, root samples from ORIS's showed significantly less root necrosis caused by fungal pathogens than did samples from CMVs, averaging 9% in OMVs vs. 31% in CMVs. Phylloxera populations per 100 g of root did not differ significantly between OMVs and CMVs, although there was a trend toward higher populations in OMVs, Soil parameters, percent organic matter, total nitrogen, nitrate, and percent sand/silt/clay also did not differ significantly between the two regimes. Cultures of necrotic root tissue show ed significantly higher levels of the beneficial fungus Trichoderma in OMVs in 1997 but not in 1998, and there sere significantly higher levels of the pathogens Fusarium oxysporum and Cylindrocarpon sp. in CMVs in 1998 but not in 1997, Implications for further research and for viticulture are discussed.

ID UNCERTAINTY; PRINCIPLE; SCIENCE
AB Posing the question of whether the precautionary principle has a role in risk assessment effectively constrains any debate of the issue within a framework predicated on the assumption that application of risk assessment is inevitable in the formulation of regulatory decisions. The question can equally validly be expressed in terms of whether there is a role for risk assessment in the formulation of precautionary legislation. This allows the debate then to turn on consideration of two questions: Firstly, does the precautionary principle have a role in policy development? and secondly, is this role consistent and compatible with a risk based approach to regulation? When recast in these terms, a more holistic comparison of the aims and objectives of both approaches and of their relative power in the formulation of regulation becomes possible. This leads to the conclusion that the precautionary principle is, when defined and applied correctly, scientifically more robust than risk assessment. Precautionary approaches utilize scientific information and conform robustly to a scientific process but also explicitly incorporate indeterminacies into the decision making framework. Moreover, the precautionary principle when applied to environmental regulation, is more likely to lead to regulation consistent with global sustainability. On this premise, this paper argues that risk based approaches are essentially incompatible with approaches based on the precautionary paradigm, and that of the two, risk assessment is more likely to lead to unsustainable underprotection of the environment.

AB Current controversy regarding how and when the precautionary principle should be applied to the introduction of new technology has created a false dichotomy, a dichotomy between conventional, risk-based decision making and an alternative paradigm that seemingly denounces risk assessment. As we compare views of the precautionary principle relative to our own operating standards for ensuring human and environmental safety, we perceive no irreconcilable conflict. Due precaution is entirely consistent with sound, cost-effective management of the risks and uncertainties inherent in new technologies. The principle guides prudent risk management actions under a prescribed set of circumstances, i.e., potentially serious or irreversible risks, or incomplete characterization (high uncertainty). In order to enable technological innovation toward a more sustainable future, it is critical that any preventative measures taken under these circumstances be provisional in nature, pending adequate risk characterization. As with all risk management. decisions, we contend that the principle requires consideration of a suite of factors beyond risk assessment, including political, social, legal and cultural considerations to tailor the measures proportionately to the risk alt hand. Overall, we are encouraged to find relatively broad agreement in this interpretation with a number of key multinational governmental and trade institutions.

AB The Heretaunga Plains, Hawke's Bay, New Zealand, is underlain by Quaternary fluvial, estuarine-lagoonal, and marine deposits infilling a subsiding syncline. Within the depositional sequence, river channel gravels form one of the most important aquifer systems in New Zealand. An interconnected unconfined-confined aquifer system contains groundwater recharged from the Ngaruroro River bed at the inland margin of the plain, 20 km from the coast. At the coast. gravel aquifers extend to a depth of 250 m. In 1993-95, 66 Mm(3) of high quality groundwater was abstracted for city and rural water supply, agriculture, industry, and horticulture. Use of groundwater, particularly for irrigation, has increased in the last 5 years. Concern as to the sustainability of the groundwater resource led to a research programme (1991-96). This paper presents the results and recommends specific monitoring and research work to refine the groundwater balance, and define and maintain the sustainable yield of the aquifer system. Three critical management factors are identified. These are (1) to ensure maintenance of consistent, unimpeded groundwater recharge from the Ngaruroro River; (2) to specifically monitor groundwater levels and quality at the margins of the aquifer system, where transmissivity is <5000 m(2)/d and summer groundwater levels indicate that abstraction exceeds recharge; (3) to review groundwater-quality programs to ensure that areas where contamination vulnerability is identified as being highest are covered by regular monitoring.

AB The present unlinked anonymous study was done among sexually active rural women to assess the extent of spread of HIV and its awareness. Peripheral blood samples were collected on filter paper strips from 1251 pregnant women residing in villages in three Primary Health Centres in Pune district of Maharashtra. flutes were tested for HIV antibodies in two different ELISA systems. Awareness on HIV/AIDS was assessed using a structured questionnaire. Fifteen (1.2%) samples were detected to be HIV seropositive. HIV seroprevalence was significantly higher among villages situated close to highways (P<0.025). Majority (>95%) of the participating women were housewives. Although 70 per cent were aware of the existence of AIDS, only 33 per cent knew about all the main modes of HIV transmission. Their main sources of information on AIDS were health camps, health workers (70%) and television (45%). Awareness was associated with higher level of literacy (P<0.001). Many women had misconceptions about the modes of spread of HIV. Greater emphasis needs to be placed on instituting long-term and sustainable strategies to create awareness among young couples with an emphasis on involvement of health workers in rural areas.

DT Article
AB Since the beginning of planned development in India, the issue of technology has been raised at various levels and also recognised as one of the aspects of planning strategy. It appears that the process has bypassed problems related to the technology for the eradication of rural unemployment. The present exercise puts toward the basic principles of rural reconstruction as envisaged by Mahatma Gandhi who devoted all his energies in search of viable, sustainable and capital saving machines. The present article, attempts to highlight the views of Mahatma Gandhi in the sphere of technology and suggests means accordingly, so that the worker is not displaced from his/her home and hearth.

TI Survey of distribution and farmers' perceptions of speargrass [Imperata

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PEST MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE diagnostic survey; weed control; smallscale farming; weeds
AB Several insects, pathogens and weeds are serious constraints upon cassava production in West Africa. The International Institute of Tropical Agriculture and agricultural research institutions from Benin, Cameroon, Ghana, and Nigeria initiated the Ecologically Sustainable Cassava Plant Protection Project to diagnose cassava production constraints and to use this information to develop and implement sustainable plant protection strategies in West Africa. This paper discusses survey findings related to weed constraints, primarily speargrass, which have been identified as a major weed problem in many crops, including cassava. Surveys were conducted at 241 locations during the dry season (December to February) in 1994 and the wet season (June to August) in 1995 in participating countries. The frequency of occurrence and percentage cover of speargrass varied with ecological zone but not season of assessment. Speargrass was most abundant in the transition forest, mountain forest, and wet savannah, and least common in the rain forest and dry savannah. Speargrass cover ranged from 9% to 79% in fields where it occurred. Available P explained 42% of the variation in the severity of speargrass; management factors (e.g. fallow length and cropping intensity) explained only 5% of the variance. Overall, 50% of the farmers ranked speargrass as the most important weed while Chromolaena odorata (L.) King & Rob. and parasitic weeds were ranked important by 39% and 8% of the farmers, respectively. Most farmers (82%) applied manual practices which needed to be repeated three to four times to reduce speargrass to non-damaging levels.

AB The formation of algal detrital particles in a completely cell-detached form, namely, single cell detritus (SCD) was reported for the first time by the author during the microbial degradation process of macroalgal thalli. SCD display 3 characteristics suitable for feed for aquatic hatchery animals: 1) The size of SCD is in the 2-14 mu m range, which is similar to that of dietary phytoplankton; 2) The cell wall components of SCD are partially degraded which facilitates digestion; 3) Bacterial cells are attached to SCD, which modifies the algal detritus to protein-rich particles. The use of SCD as a potential hatchery diet instead of phytoplankton culture, which is labor-intensive, was successfully demonstrated based on feeding experiments with Artemia. Further modification of SCD could include the attachment of bacteria to SCD which would exert beneficial effects on the hatchery animals. Use of SCD diets in fish feeding regimes is an attempt to introduce the concept of detrital food web to aquaculture systems, which could contribute to the development of sustainable fish nursery systems.

ID EXERCISE; GROWTH
AB Effects of alpage were investigated on 28 heifers (14 Braunvieh, 14 Black and White) during two summers in which half the animals were grazed on the mountains, and the other half stabled in the home farm. In a factorial design seven heifers were alped twice, seven not at all and the others spent either the first or the second summer on the mountain pasture. Effects were defined as direct when present in the subsequent farm period (i.e. autumn and winter) or carry-over when they occurred after the second alpage, as a consequence of mountain pasture in year 1. Growth on mountain pasture was reduced or negative, compensatory growth was observed both as a direct and as a carry-over effect. Respiration rate and pulse were reduced, and possibly even more as carry-over effect in alped cattle. Effects on blood values of cell and haemoglobin were less clear, rather positive but mostly statistically insignificant. Lactate, CK and LDH levels were decreased in alped heifers relative to home-managed ones. The exceptions are direct effects on LDH and carry-over effect on lactate. HDL-C is increased and NEFA decreased in alped heifers relative to farm-kept animals. Respiration and pulse rates, blood cell counts and haemoglobin levels in Friesian heifers were higher than in Braunvieh. Breed x management interactions were significant for several traits - differences between mountain- and farm-kept heifers were greater for Braunvieh for haemoglobin and NEFA and opposite in sign in the two breeds for HDL-C and LDH. The carry-over effects indicate long term influence of alpage which could benefit later health and sustainability.

DT Article
DE Hei River basin; water resources development; hydrological change;
   ecology; degradation
AB This paper outlines the influences of water resource development on the ecology of the arid regions of north-west China. The Hei River basin served as a case study. Water resources in the arid zones of north-west China, which have an inland hydrological basin as their unit, form relatively independent ecosystems. In such basins, surface runoff flowing out of the mountain reaches of rivers become the only water source available for the middle and lower reaches. Important changes in the hydrological conditions and ecology of the Hei River basin have taken place in the last 50 years. The discharge in the lower reaches of the river has decreased significantly and more than 30 tributaries as well as terminal lakes have dried up. Such hydrological changes resulted in a marked degradation of the environment, secondary salinization and desertification of land in the entire basin. Such changes are mainly attributable to the misuse of water resources. The primary methods required to stabilize the environment and maintain sustainable development of these basins, involve holistic planning, which takes into consideration the interests of the upper, middle and lower reaches, rational distribution and use of water resources, and harmonization of relations between economic development and protection of the environment.

AB I study the contract design problem facing microfinance-lending organizations (MFOs) that want to maximize the impact and outreach of their lending activities to a target population of poor borrowers while remaining financially sustainable. Tradeoffs between outreach, sustainability and financial leverage are shaped by the endogenous monitoring and delegation costs that arise within a chain of agency relationships subject to moral hazard between borrowers, loan staff, MFO equity-owners, and outside investors. All else equal, sustainable MFOs that target poorer borrowers must charge higher interest rates, have higher staff costs per dollar loaned, and are less leveraged. Analysis of data for 72 MFOs tends to support the findings. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

   the Jamaican 'Partner'
SO JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS
LA English
DT Article
DE informal finance; Jamaica; transaction costs
AB Using a unique sample of rotating savings and credit association (Rosca) members from Jamaica, we provide the first econometric tests of the recent theoretical advances in the literature on Roscas, and find considerable support for an economic theory of Roscas. We find, for example, that payments to the Rosca leader significantly enhance the sustainability of the Rosca, and that the contractual relationship between the leader and other Rosca members is 'transaction cost minimizing' - when the degree of asset specificity is higher the contract is more flexible. Other theoretical predictions we validate are the inverse relationship between size of Rosca and size of contribution, and the use of Rosca funds for durable goods purchase.

TI Free competition without sustainable development? Tanzanian cotton
   sector liberalisation, 1994/95 to 1997/98
SO JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
AB This article summarises the results of fieldwork carried out in 1997/8 season on post-liberalisation changes in the Tanzanian cotton sector Developments in primary marketing, ginning and the export trade are reviewed on the basis of survey material. Market entry by private companies has been high, leading to considerable competition and slight increases in producers' share of the world price. But real producer price and cultivation increases have not been sustained. Following changes in the input supply system, insecticide use has fallen sharply, along with the quality and underlying international price of the cotton crop. Tanzania's place in the world market has been re-defined as a producer for a specific time-based 'market window'. This places a question mark over the sustainability of the sector's future, and by inference over policy reforms whose main emphasis is to increase competition.

   promise and economic constraints
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE sustainable development; multiple-species production; ecological
   viability; economic feasibility
AB The vast plain known as the Gran Chaco is a natural region of more than 1.3 million square kilometres, the second largest natural biome in South America, with only the Amazon region being larger: It extends over parts of Argentina, Bolivia, Paraguay and, marginally, Brazil. The original landscape of the region was mostly a park land with patches of hardwoods intermingled with grasslands. Increasing human encroachment, largely by poor campesinos, with associated overgrazing, excessive timber harvesting charcoal production and over-exploitation of wildlife, is transforming the region into a dense and unproductive shrub land and is contributing to increasing rural poverty. A management system for the sustainable use of the Chaco has been developed based on a multiple-species ranching system that includes beef, timber; charcoal and wildlife production. An evaluation of the management system finds that it is capable of protecting and enhancing the resource base, while providing higher economic returns in a sustainable manner: However; high initial costs, as well as a divergence between the 'best' interests of campesinos and society, jeopardize the feasibility of the managed system.

AB This paper presents an analysis of a major wilderness preservation controversy concerning the Tatshenshini-Alsek area in north-western British Columbia. it demonstrates how structured judgements about fundamental objectives, potential impacts, and key trade-offs can be used to gain insight into a complex policy decision, even when detailed information is scarce. The basic steps of a decision analysis are employed, including structuring objectives and measures, developing alternatives and characterizing uncertainties regarding impacts. A workshop involving nine senior provincial government experts in relevant areas was held to investigate the range of views about trade-offs involved in the decision. A constructive, small group elicitation approach was used to characterize value trade-offs that were summarized in terms of value function, which was then used to evaluate the alternatives. The study provided information for the provincial government decision to turn the whole area into a park, foregoing mining development. (C) 1999 Academic Press.

ID POLITICAL-ECONOMY; CITY; PLACE; TIES
AB During the 1980s. the concept of sustainable development emerged as a popular solution to the problem of meeting the material needs of a rapidly growing population while minimizing environmental damage. Rather than pitting economic growth against environmental protection, proponents of sustainability focus on development which meets the needs of both present and future generations. This new legitimacy has prompted scholars to broaden the range of issues to which sustainability can be applied. A potentially important development along these lines has been the growing body of literature surrounding the concept of sustainable community development. In this paper, we delineate the central features of the sustainable community, assess obstacles to achieving sustainable communities, and present a conceptual framework for sustainable community development based on an interactional approach to community.

   AGRICULTURE; ENERGY
AB This paper analyzes the role of legitimization processes in the struggle over farmland protection policies in Israel. In the early sixties a centralized farmland protection program was institutionalized, curtailing private land owners' and leaseholders' property rights on farmlands. The legitimacy accorded to such measures is explained as a function of the congruence between social norms, power structure and dominant ideology at the time. Then, the paper follows the changes in power, ideology, social norms, sanctioned discourse and the role of agriculture in the economy. These changes undermined the basis of the farmland protection rationales, and led to a crisis of legitimacy in the early nineties. As a result of several institutional and policy shifts in the early nineties, a time of rapid growth, concern shifted to the implications of growth for the future of open spaces. This concern over the loss of positive externalities was shared by environmentalists, urban and exurban consumption interests. planners and several elements within the rural establishment. As a result a new set of plans was introduced. Focusing on the central district; where the most severe development pressures are felt, the paper compares the sanctioned discourse and use of rationales in the new- plans and documents to those of previous plans. These plans focus on averting the loss of positive externalities, rather than productive capacity, and are couched in economic terms, rather than ideological terms, reflecting the shift in language of the sanctioned discourse. It shows that the choice of rationales for legitimizing countryside conservation reflects the struggle over rural landscapes, as the rationales are used to cobble a coalition of planners, environmentalists, farmers. urbanites and exurbanites, against a powerful development coalition.

AB This paper highlights the key issues which affected the design and implementation of water policy within the first phase of the Environmental Programme for the Danube River Basin. The programme represents one of several regional environmental initiatives in Eastern Europe which were designed to control pollution through the coordinated actions of national governments, international organizations, international financial institutions and non-governmental organizations.
   The paper identifies three key controversial findings. Firstly although the programme has been a valuable tool for the skins and technology transfer which are necessary to enable the Danube states to control water pollution, it has failed to generate the anticipated levels of capital investment or establish itself as a cornerstone of Danube basin management. Secondly, the policy process has been beset by political, economic, social and historical conflicts and power struggles between the participating parties. Thirdly, valuable lessons for the strategic and sustainable management of international river basins can be learned from the operational experiences of the Danube programme.

AB Recent advances in open-cycle gas-turbine technology have resulted in station thermal efficiencies which are comparable with the large fossil-fired stations built in the 1970s. The combination of a steam cycle to the gas turbine culminating in the 'combined cycle gas turbine' station has led to even greater generating efficiencies. These advances in power-station design have led to reductions in water demand per megawatt of electricity generated. However, water usage still contributes significantly to increasing fuel efficiency in (a) the electrical generating process, (b) reducing atmospheric emissions from stations burning fossil fuels, and (c) utilizing gas turbines. Considerations arising from the competitive electricity market and wider issues of sustainability and environmental improvements, in general, suggest that water will continue to be required for power generation in the foreseeable future.

AB This paper describes the main aspects and outputs of a major project, which was completed recently, and was aimed at producing the necessary tools to support a sustainable and integrated development for the water supply and wastewater sectors in Portugal, within the present context of political prominence, the availability of important financial resources and opening to the private sector.
   The major outputs and innovating contributions described in this paper, which address a wide range of users-including regulators, water utilities, consultants, contractors, manufactures, research and development organisations and universities-can be seen as guidance tools for a sustainable process of technology transfer and procedures for the alteration of behaviours. This project was developed within the philosophy and principles of the Portuguese Quality System, in which the final goal is to create conditions for the qualification and certification of all those interested in this process.
   The authors believe that the set of tools resulting from this project could significantly contribute to the quality which must be associated with such a large number of water supply and wastewater systems during the next few years, in order to ensure that we are working for excellence towards the achievement of those essential services.

AB The potential contribution of integrated farming systems (IFS) to the development of a more sustainable agriculture has been largely ignored within social science and by policy analysts. The goals of IFS are to sustain agricultural production, maintain farm incomes, safeguard the environment and respond to consumer concerns about food quality issues. IFS can be conceptualised as a 'third way' or middle course for agriculture between conventional and organic farming. This paper describes the origins and basic principles of IFS and positions this distinctive approach to agriculture within the agri-environmental debate. It also explores some of the implications of pursuing this 'third way' for farmers and the institutional and policy frameworks. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In the current debate about the future of food quality, the merits of organic agriculture are frequently championed, but few studies have sought to integrate the changes in soil conditions, biodiversity and socio-economic welfare linked to the conversion from non-organic to organic production. This article aims to undertake this approach with respect to one case study. Its conclusions may not be representative for all organic conversions, but the findings are of relevance at a time of debate over changing patterns of subsidies and other incentives in agricultural policy. The study showed that there were demonstrable differences in overall environmental conditions in the comparison of organic and non-organic farming, with held evidence of increased species diversity, and an eventual improvement in the profitability of the organic farming regime. The broad conclusion is that there are definite environmental and economic advantages arising from organic agriculture that are not fully reflected in the present pattern of agricultural incentives. The study also showed that variations in farm management practice strongly influence the notion of on-farm and off-farm environmental consequences. The implications of these findings for the future of sustainable agriculture and for interdisciplinary science are also discussed. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB There are a number of significant environmental impacts that arise from agricultural practices that may be influenced by policy. A Strategic Environmental Assessment Method (SEAM) is described which aims to assess the environmental impacts of agricultural policy and aid the development of more sustainable policy formulation. The method addresses the issues of selecting appropriate performance criteria and measurements, and makes use of effect-damage functions and targets to determine the significance of potential impacts in relation to sustainability. A set of profiles is produced, describing the environmental performance of a specific policy. A confidence assessment system (CAS) is also described which provides details about the quality of the assessment and areas of uncertainty. SEAM provides information about impacts in simple format that can be easily used in decision making. It can identify environmental trade-offs and provides a holistic view that is essential when making decisions that affect the environment. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

DE olive trees; production systems; subsidies; soil erosion; soil and water
   conservation; southern Spain
AB The European Union spent about two billion ECU per year on subsidies for the olive oil sector, of which Spain received about 35%. For the rainfed areas in southern spain the olive oil sector is crucial, and so are these subsidies. The European Commission has formulated two options to change the subsidy system, but these do not take the production systems and enviornmental aspects into account. Many olive plantations are affected by soil erosion. This paper analyses the olive tree production systems in southern Spain, the subsidy systems and the soil erosion problems. It then raises the question whether the subsidies could not be provided in a different way, in order to make olive tree cultivation more sustainable by reducing soil erosion and flood hazard.

SO LIVESTOCK PRODUCTION SCIENCE

DE sustainable agriculture; systems; research methods; ethics
ID SYSTEMS; AGRICULTURE
AB Research and policy for sustainable agriculture can be grouped into two broad paradigms. Those that define sustainability in terms of resource availability emphasize accounting for the rates at which resources are produced and depleted, and frame sustainability in light of strategies for conservation, regeneration and substitution for increasingly scarce resources. Those that define sustainability in terms of functional integrity emphasize dynamic system models of complex ecological and social processes of reproduction, and frame sustainability as relative in light of system vulnerability to anthropogenic stress. Broad comparison of these paradigms shows that a) there is currently greater research capacityy for analyzing issues under a resource availability paradigm, but that b) functional integrity approaches are more likely to produce ethical consensus over the goals and purposes of livestock production, relative to larger social purposes. The functional integrity paradigm is better for understanding the importance of biodiversity, the problem of spatial and temporal scale, and the relationship between society and ecology. Animal scientists should therefore develop a research approach to functional integrity and should also take advantage of a pluri- and interdisciplinary approach. The existing research capacity for resource availability should not limit animal science to addressing the sustainability of livestock production exclusively in resource availability terms.

AB Livestock farming systems (LFS) research in Western Europe has been mainly conducted by 'generalist' animal production researchers. It involves strong interaction with a wide range of disciplines outside animal science to provide an improved understanding of the potential for the integrated development of LFS. LFS researchers have developed concepts, methods and tools to address the livestock farming activity as a whole. The approach is primarily based upon a dual concept of a farm which integrates human objectives and constraints with technical knowledge derived from 'conventional' animal and other biological sciences. Progress is achieved through the application of systems modelling. The need for such a systems approach has increased with recent political pressures in Europe to limit agricultural production, reduce pollution, enhance the environment, meet new societal concerns such as product quality and animal welfare, and maintain rural infrastructures. The objective of the LFS Working Group of EAAP is to improve the basis of this systems approach within the animal production scientific community. We consider that LFS research can contribute support for improving the sustainability of livestock systems provided that: (i) the interdisciplinary nature of the research is maintained and (ii) the approach maintains its roots in the community of animal scientists. These themes are developed in the paper. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Dairy farming in the Netherlands in transition towards more efficient
   nutrient use
SO LIVESTOCK PRODUCTION SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
DE dairy farming; nutrient emissions; environmental tuning; sustainability;
   nutrient uptake from soil; nutrient conversion animal; system approach
AB In the Netherlands, agriculture as a whole is not environmentally sustainable. It contributes to the emission of greenhouse gases (similar to 15%), acid rain (similar to 50%) and groundwater pollution (similar to 85%). The surplus of phosphate, averaged over the area of cultivated land amounting to similar to 40 kg P ha(-1), originates similar to 30 and similar to 40% from dairy farming and pigs, respectively. Nitrogen surpluses, amounting to similar to 350 kg ha(-1), contribute to ammonia, N2O and NOx volatilization and nitrate leaching, levels that exceed present and future standards. Dairy farming contributes similar to 55% of the nitrogen losses.
   Despite their genetic potential and advanced diet formulation, the efficiency with which animals convert nutrients into animal products remains rather low. A major part of the nutrients is excreted in faeces and urine. Hence, there is an urgent need for more sustainable nutrient management at higher hierarchical levels for production systems in which the inputs are tuned to the carrying capacity of the agro-ecosystem and the internal nutrients in animal manure, e.g. N and P, are used more efficiently.
   The paper discusses the effectiveness of management practices to reduce the nutrient losses, along with aspects of system behaviour. Nutrient flows of dairy farms are analysed and the most effective interventions identified to (1) maintain level of production while (2) reducing the nutrient losses to environmentally acceptable levels. Finally, results/projections of prototype experimental farms are discussed. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Comparison of a grazing- with an indoor-system of lamb fattening in
   Greece
SO LIVESTOCK PRODUCTION SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
DE fattening lambs; grazing; indoors; production systems; intake
AB The objective of this work was to compare two different :Lamb fattening systems. Twenty weaned male crossbred (Karagouniko x Boutsiko) lambs were divided into two equal groups (29 kg average body weight). Lambs of group A were kept exclusively on pasture for fattening, while lambs of group B were kept indoors in individual pens and fed 200 g of hay/lamb/day and concentrates ad libitum. Food intake and growth rate were recorded regularly and food conversion ratio was determined in both groups. Herbage growth (by HFRO sward stick), herbage yield (by cages) and herbage intake (by n-alkanes) were also determined. All lambs were slaughtered after 60 days and carcass characteristics were determined. The average DMI was 2.15 and 1.60 kg/lamb/day, and the average BW gain 200 and 246 g/day for groups A and B, respectively. Food conversion ratio was in favor of lambs of group B (10.75 vs. 6.52 kg DM/kg BW gain and 1.80 vs. 1.09 kg of dietary CP/kg BW gain), but feeding costs (2.2 vs. 3.35 USD/kg carcass) and labor costs were in favor of lambs of group A. The carcass weight of lambs kept on pasture was lower (P < 0.05) by 2.2 kg, but omental (P < 0.05) and perinephric (P < 0.001) fat were significantly heavier in animals of group B. It was concluded that the system of fattening lambs on pasture can allow for a higher margin to the farmer because of the lower inputs and the products of higher value, compared to the indoors fattening system. Moreover, this grazing system, operating under conditions of pronounced traditional character, can be physically, biologically and economically sustainable. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB The paper summarises the results of a study for sustainable development of beef cattle production on peat bog soil pasture in Hungary. On-farm research was carried out for five years to gain some basic data about herbage production from peat bog soil pastures and animal performance resulting from their: use by beef cows herds of different genotypes. Monitoring and study was carried out in three farms with both native and seeded grasslands for suckler cows. Each of the herds was composed of Hungarian Simmental (HS), Hereford (HE) and HS x HE crossbred cows (F-1 and R-1 generations). Herds were kept outdoors all year round and cows mated in summer, the calves being weaned in autumn. Significant differences were observed in reproduction and weaning performances between HS and HE cows. Calving rate was 79.3% and 82.6%, survival rate to weaning 97.6% and 91.3%, and 205-days weaning weight 193.2kg and 173.6kg respectively. There were significant heterosis effects in the case of crossbred cows (F-1, R-1) in both calving rate ( + 9.7% and + 5.7% respectively), and the survival rate of F-1, R-1 and R-2 calves (+ 6.3%, + 3.5%, + 0.7% respectively). Annual herbage production differed significantly between years, farms and pasture types. The range in variation was from 2.82 to 3.42 tonnes/ha for dry matter, from 27.8 to 34.4 thousand MJ/ha for metabolisable energy and from 3.85 to 6.15 kg/ha for crude protein. Calculated from the average dry matter annual production yield and cows requirements, the annual carrying capacity of the pastures studied ranged from 55 cows/100ha for the large size HS to 66 cows/100ha for the smaller size HE. The highest calf crop (50.7 weaned calves and 9.6 tonnes total weaning weight) was obtained in the case of F-1 cow herds while the lowest (42.6 and 8.23 respectively) in the case of HS. Herbage and hair sampler; analyses for macro- and micro-elements showed that Na, Cu, Zn and Se supplied by the herbage are insufficient wish respect to cows needs. A mineral supplementation could be beneficial in order to sustain health and reproduction. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A number of research-development studies of livestock production systems in legions of France which are experiencing local farming crises are described. The effectiveness of a national experimental programme for promoting sustainable regional development is examined at various locations in France. The experiment focuses on action at the farm level and takes into account the methodological lessons of the reported research-development actions to achieve sustainable land use. The methods of achieving land use sustainability are analysed by studying the diversity of local production systems, farm operation and spatial structure in relation to long-term changes in the characteristics of the region. General principles for addressing animal husbandry in a land use sustainability scope ape drawn from this set of experiences. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Focusing on the issue of veldt degradation and grazing pressure on rangelands, a simplified model was constructed for a sustainable stocking rate (SR) evaluation of the complex system of semi-arid and scab-humid regions in Southern Africa. The model considers the current activity in Southern Africa of multispecies herding, which allows a better utilization of vegetation and has a positive effect on plant and animal biodiversity. The model is intended as a practical and flexible tool supporting practical decision-making mainly at a local level, e.g. by extension services. It relies strongly on indigenous knowledge and flexibility. Users are therefore the main sources of information for the required inputs. The model combines the complexity of the range ecosystem with accuracy and precision of SR evaluation, while minimising input data requirements. The assessment of a grazing pressure compatible with the conservation of rangeland is based on a nutritional approach. Stocking rate (SR) is evaluated on the basis of the selected diet and total dry matter and energy intake. For a sustainable use of rangeland, forage availability is assumed to be the maximum consumption rate for each of the vegetation components (trees, shrub, grass) which does not endanger the long-term production of the vegetation. The whole model deals with a 12-month or a season period and it works on a regional :scale, a portion of land surface delimited by its intrinsic physical, biological and socioeconomical characteristics, with a minimum dimension of 100 km(2). The regional area under investigation is first divided into Grazing Unit Areas (GUA) homogenous in terms of their topography, soils, and vegetation cover. Results consist of three stocking rates (minimum, intermediate and maximum) calculated from a full consumption of the forage available on each of the vegetation components according to their respective levels of availability. After the discussion of the model, results of a case study are presented. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In the north-east of France, livestock farms, mainly dairy cattle farms, increasingly attempt to replace grass fodder by silage maize. This evolution of agricultural practices modifies the quality of groundwater for human consumption. We propose three indicators of diffuse nitrate pollution risk at three organisational levels: (i) the livestock unit: a 'hydro-appraisal' based on cattle feeding management is calculated for the dairy and the fattening units of the Experimental Research Station of Mirecourt, in order to compare the pollution risks due to the production schemes (dairy cows fed with grass against maize, beef steers fed with grass against beef calves fed with maize); (ii) the livestock farm: an indicator based on the cropping plan and on the mean nitrate leaching under the main cropping and grassland systems is calculated on twelve livestock farm types classified from 2211 farms in Lorraine, in order to identify the fanning systems that present a pollution risk; (iii) the livestock farming region: the previous indicator is located at the French commune scale by taking into account the proportion of farm types and the relative farming area used by each type, in order to differentiate geographic areas according to the estimated pollution risk. The construction and the combining of such indicators contribute to the development of decision support tools for those concerned with water resource protection and sustainable agricultural land use in livestock farming regions.

AB The international debate on sustainable development has traditionally focused on the importance of respecting community values and safeguarding the natural environment, privileging the social and ecological dimensions of sustainable development. In contrast, the financial, managerial and competitive implications have been rather neglected. Such a lack is, in our opinion, extremely critical since the pursuit of sustainable development requires firms to deploy significant financial resources and managerial effort. Assuming a business perspective on sustainable development, this article suggests a framework which may help firms and public institutions to identify the necessary competitive conditions for an effective evolution towards sustainable development, and to understand the major managerial implications of such evolution.

AB The biogeochemical cycles of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) connect all the abiotic and biotic components of ecosystems to one another in a holistic way. As such, the spatial and temporal dynamics of C and N budgets are closely coupled with variations in such ecosystem processes as productivity, nutrient cycling, stability, succession and biodiversity. In turn, the cycling rates of C and N are affected by the type, magnitude, severity and frequency of natural and anthropogenic disturbances, which induce changes in the structure and function of ecosystems locally and regionally, and which may endanger the sustainability of ecological goods and services globally. C and N budgets are, therefore, significant ecosystem-level indicators that can signal deviations from sustainable ecosystem management under current and changing patterns of human disturbances. Thus, they can assist in evaluating the potential effects of human disturbances on the structure and function of ecosystems, and in developing preventive and mitigative measures in decision- and policymaking. Examples are provided by process-based models to quantify regional C and N dynamics as indicators of sustainability for cropland, drastically disturbed (coal surface-mined land) and urban ecosystems in the State of Ohio in the American Midwest.

AB Soil fertility decline is occurring over large parts of the world, particularly the developing world. It occurs mainly through intensive cultivation and the inadequate application of replacement nutrients, and through deforestation and clearance of vegetation on sandy soils. Large amounts of soil nutrients are also lost to the terrestrial ecosystems through wind and water erosion. Low soil fertility is considered as one of the most important constraints on improved agricultural production. To sustain the future world population more fertilizers are required, which may become an environmental hazard, unless adequate technical and socio-economic measures are taken. It is estimated that, by the year 2020 at a global level, 70% of plant nutrients will have to come from fertilizers. Fertilizers are thus indispensable for sustained food production, but excessive use of mineral fertilizers has roused environmental concerns. Chief among these concerns are eutrophication of fresh water bodies, global warming and stratospheric ozone depletion, proliferation of algal blooms in coastal waters and contribution towards acid rain.

AB This article explores the extent to which nine small midocean island Commonwealth territories in the South Pacific have tackled the challenges of exclusive economic zone (EEZ) management. The sample territories (the Cook Islands, Fiji, Kiribati, Nauru, Niue, the Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu) all have populations of less than 1 million, are islands, possess 200-nautical-mile EEZ entitlements in excess of 100,000 square nautical miles, and are past or present members of the British Commonwealth. Through regional organizations such as the South Pacific Forum Fisheries Agency, the South Pacific Applied Geoscience Commission, and the South Pacific Commission, impressively extensive steps have been taken to sustainably develop or identify the marine resources of the territories' EEZs.

ID MANUFACTURING STRATEGY; ADVANTAGE
AB The growing role played by production as a key strategic element for competitive success is widely recognised. Many companies have obtained sustainable competitive advantages and, consequently, superior results, due to the manufacturing excellence or superiority obtained through the development of resources and capabilities in this area and thus, through the implementation of certain manufacturing objectives and policies.
   The work reported is part of a broader research programme which has enabled us to ascertain the present situation of Spanish industrial companies in the field of production strategic management. It uses a database of the manufacturing strategies of a sample of 114 factories belonging to large companies in Spain. Specifically, the aim of this paper is to verify, for the Spanish case, the hypothesis that there exist manufacturing objectives and policies which are applied in a general way in the industrial companies which are most competitive in manufacturing.
   For this purpose we have distinguished the factories with strengths or advantages in manufacturing in relation to their best competitor (for the manufacturing priorities taken as a whole, as well as for each of them considered individually), from those factories which are not competitive in this area. Using the discriminant analysis technique and taking 1994 as a reference, the manufacturing objectives and policies followed in the past (1992-1993) and those foreseen for the future (1995-1999) which enable us to differentiate the companies that are competitive in manufacturing from those which are not, have been recorded. In this way the manufacturing strategies of the large Spanish companies which are most competitive in this area have been identified, as opposed to the least competitive ones.

AB In sub-Saharan Africa conservation of biodiversity is increasingly predicated on finding ways to ensure that the economic value of maintaining a landscape in its 'natural' state meets or exceeds the expected returns from converting the area to an alternative land use, such as agriculture. 'Wildlands' in Africa must generate, directly or from donor contributions, funds sufficient to cover both the operating costs of conservation, and the opportunity costs of forgoing other forms of resource use. Government and donor investments currently meet less than 30 per cent of the estimated recurring costs required to manage the protected-area network within central African countries effectively, and cover none of the growing opportunity costs incurred to maintain protected areas. Unfortunately, few additional sources of funding are available. Tourism is only economically viable where charismatic species exist in 'safe' areas that are not more than a few hours drive in a 4x4 vehicle from an international airport-ostensibly excluding tourism from most of central Africa. In contrast, a review of available information suggests that safari hunting could offer a significant and sustainable source of financing to offset some of the costs of maintaining protected areas in central Africa. However, better quantitative data are needed to assess whether trophy hunting is both ecologically sustainable and economically competitive over the long term relative to other land uses.

AB The social structures and tensions in French society at the end of the 18th Century help us to understand why the invention of the paper machine by Louis Robert came at that time. The main progressive steps in paper machine construction are recalled and also the efforts of all those industries that have contributed to the present standard of paper production, are suitably acknowledged.
   An assessment of the present position concerning the production capacities of paper machines is followed by a personal estimate of those technical problem areas that will require progressive new solutions. These solutions are to lead to a production technology for paper products economically better and environmentally sustainable for the foreseeable future.

AB Crop rotation is an essential practice in sustainable agricultural systems, because its effects on soil fertility and other benefits including reduction on weed competition. A field experiment was carried out at the UEMA experimental station, Sao Luis, Maranhao State, Brazil, to evaluate the effect of crop rotation on weed population, leaf chlorophyll concentration and yield of rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. Guarani). The rice was cultivated with and without N application, and in rotation with cowpea( Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.), hyacinthbean (Crotalaria paulina Schrank) and velvetbean (Mucuna aterrima Piper & Tracy). First crop legume residues were highest in hyacinthbean, less in velvetbean and least in cowpea. They were left at soil surface as mulch for the second crop, which was cultivated in a minimum tillage system without using herbicides. At the second crop, weed biomass, weed cover, and weed density were lower in the hyacinthbean and velvetbean rotation than in continuous rice. Leaf chlorophyll concentration was greater in the hyacinthbean-rice sequence than in control plots. Rice yield was greater when rotated with hyacinthbean or velvetbean than in continuous crop with or without N application. It was concluded that legume in rice rotation reduces weed competition and improves the yield of rice.

AB Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) comprise a class of biodegradable polymers which offer an environmentally sustainable alternative to petroleum-based plastics. Production of PHAs in plants is attractive since current fermentation technology is prohibitively expensive. The PHA homopolymer poly(beta-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) has previously been produced in leaves of Arabinopsis thaliana (Nawrath et al., 1994, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 91. 12760-12764). However, Brassica napus oilseed may provide a better system for PHB production because acetyl-CoA, the substrate required in the first step of PHB biosynthesis, is prevalent during fatty acid biosynthesis. Three enzymatic activities are needed to synthesize PHB: a beta-ketothiolase, an aceto-acetyl-CoA reductase and a PHB synthase. Genes from the bacterium Ralstonia eutropha encoding these enzymes were independently engineered behind the seed-specific Lesquerella fendleri oleate 12-hydroxylase promoter in a modular fashion. The gene cassettes were sequentially transferred into a single, multi-gene vector which was used to transform B. napus. Poly(beta-hydroxybutyrate) accumulated in leukoplasts to levels as high as 7.7% fresh seed weight of mature seeds. Electronmicroscopy analyses indicated that leukoplasts from these plants were distorted, yet intact, and appeared to expand in response to polymer accumulation.

AB Global environmental management is a critically important issue for the business development towards the 21st century. The focus of effort of recovery and recycling of both industrial material of pre-consumer solid waste and post-consumer solid waste has become more import-ant in recent years. As a case study, the current problem of recycling of PET bottles business in Japan is reviewed. In order to maximize productivity of global environment, the closed system, of recycling materials should be re-evaluated and established as new social and industrial systems.
   Global environmental productivity is defined as the ratio of total output to total consumption of materials and energy. Concepts such as 'Seaborg's Closed System' and 'Reverse Factories' should be considered if environmental productivity is to be maximized. To encourage a large marker for recovered material, a growing buy recycled movement has emerged. The environmental soundness of products can be enhanced through Total Quality Management (TQM). The environmental recycle laws enacted in 1997-99 in Japan is reviewed to produce plastic packages, which contain post-consumer recycled materials with the required price, performance and quality.

AB 'Twinning' is the distinctive method employed during the last two decades by the Swedish International Development Go-operation Agency (Sida) to promote institutional capacity building in development co-operation. This article reports on a study undertaken to provide evidence which would help Sida to make judgements about the efficacy of the twinning model as a basis for sustainable capacity building, and to explore ways of enhancing the method. The study indicates that the twinning method has potential advantages over other modes of development co-operation, particularly that it offers enhanced possibilities for organizational learning and sustainable capacity building. However, the study suggests that this potential is not being fully exploited. Twinning arrangements have produced major benefits in professional/technical upgrading, but there is less evidence of outcomes at the level of sustainable institutional capacity building. Contrary to Sida's expectations of its distinctive advantages, in operation, twinning tends to become a rather routine process, viewed by developing country partners as an unexceptional way of delivering aid which presents few fundamental challenges and provides essentially the same benefits as alternative methods. It appears that institutional development and organizational learning are generally not issues of major significance for partner organizations in twinning arrangements. Even at the individual level the focus is on training rather than learning, which results in the usual emphasis on formal off-job training rather than seeking opportunities for learning from work. The article presents ideas on how the current twinning approach might be renovated, and considers how agencies such as Sida might enhance their development co-operation in the realm of governance by moving beyond twinning.

AB The rapid increase in population and economic growth have led to an increase in energy demand. Coal reserves are distributed worldwide, and coal is now known to be the most stable and available energy source. However, utilization of coal as an energy source involves the generation of a great amount of coal ash, and the recycling rate of the ash is rather low. Coal ash is mainly used in civil construction materials, and there is a limit to the demand for coal ash by construction industries: therefore, the increasing amount of coal ash will be a serious problem in the near future. Different applications should be considered. In this paper, three environmentally-friendly methods for coal ash recycling are described. Firstly, alkali treatment can transform coal ash to zeolite, which is used in deodorant and for wastewater treatment and soil improvement. Secondly, potassium silicate fertilizer is produced from coal ash and has a higher retentivity in the soil than that of conventional fertilizers. Thirdly, emission of sulfur dioxide is controlled by flue gas desulfurization using coal ash. It is considered that environmentally-friendly use of coal ash is important from the viewpoints of energy, economy, and environmental strategy in order to realize the concept of sustainable development.

TI Spatial arrangement of social and economic networks among villages in

ID SUSTAINABILITY; EQUIVALENCE
AB This paper examines the spatial arrangement of social and economic networks among villages in Nang Rong district, Thailand. We use spatial information from a geographic information system (GIS) for the district to help interpret the patterns of movement of agricultural equipment (large tractors) between villages, of people into villages for temporary labor, and of people to village temples and to elementary and secondary schools within the district. Once social networks have been incorporated into the GIS they can be mapped in relation to geographic features of the district, such as topography, landcover, and locations of roads, rivers, and villages. Not only does geographic information about village locations allow us to properly orient the graphs of these networks, bur the resulting visual displays reveal strikingly different spatial arrangements for the five networks. Networks of shared temples and elementary schools link small sets of villages in close geographic proximity whereas tractor hiring, labor movement, and secondary school networks bring together larger sets of villages and span longer distances. Information on landcover from satellite digital data provides insights into the patterns of network ties throughout the district and shows a clear relationship between tractor hiring networks and type of agricultural activity in the district. The spatial analytic capabilities of the GIS also allow us to assess the impact of the administratively defined district boundary on our measured relations and to evaluate whether rivers and perennial streams create barriers to network ties between villages.

AB The term "sustainable development" is only half of the gestalt of sustainability, the other being "sustainable livelihoods." The collapse of the Northwest Atlantic cod fishery off the province of Newfoundland Canada, provides a case study of the interacting biophysical and socioeconomic elements that can decimate a once-abundant natural resource. This collapse has resulted in the devastation of livelihoods, and the long-term impact on the Northwest Atlantic ecosystem remains unknown. This article analyzes the collapse as the first step in suggesting a rational fisheries management based on effective stewardship of the resource. This evaluation provides the knowledge base vital for guiding and improving fisheries policy. Several strategies are suggested to bolster a policy goal of sound conservation and management of fisheries for the benefit of the livelihoods dependent on healthy stocks. The strategies are predicated on the concept that living marine resources belong to complex adaptive systems, and are therefore best managed by decentralized rather than conventional, scientific, and top-down management schemes.

   Thailand; watershed
AB This article examines four case studies of community-based watershed management with emphasis on their operational decision-making arrangements. All the case studies established community-based regimes as a result of declining resource abundance, but differ in their operational rules, administration, effectiveness, and satisfaction among stakeholders. Even though legally the watersheds ave state property, 73% of the villagers consider them communal property. Almost all villagers are aware of the community rules governing use, with 88% voluntarily accepting the rules and over 90% thinking that they are appropriate. Rule violation by members is seen as the greatest threat to continued existence in three of the communities. The communities are compared against seven design principles associated with more robust institutional characteristics for common property resources. In general, as anticipated smaller watersheds close to the communities with clearly demarcated boundaries and fewer users and with high individual involvement in decision making are more robust.

AB There is growing recognition for the need to develop sensitive indicators of soil quality that reflect the effects of land management on soil and assist land managers in promoting long-term sustainability of terrestrial ecosystems. Eleven soil enzymes assays were investigated relative to soil management and soil quality at two study sites. Soils were sampled from the Vegetable Crop Rotation Plots (VRP) (established in 1989 in humid western Oregon) which compared continuous fescue (Festuca arundinacea) and four winter cover crop treatments in annual rotation with a summer vegetable crop. The second site was the Residue Utilization Plots (RUP) (initiated in 1931 in semi-arid Eastern Oregon) which is under a winter wheat-summer fallow and compared inorganic N, green manure and beef manure treatments. Soil also was sampled at the research center from a nearby grass pasture that is on the same soil type. The enzymes were alpha- and beta-glucosidase, alpha- and beta-galactosidase, amidase, arylsulfatase, deaminase, fluorescein diacetate hydrolysis, invertase, cellulase and urease. At both sites there was a significant treatment effect for each enzyme tested (P < 0.05). Enzyme activities (except alpha- and beta-glucosidase and alpha- and beta-galactosidase) were generally higher in continuous grass fields than in cultivated fields. In cultivated systems, activity was higher where cover crops or organic residues were added as compared to treatments without organic amendments. It was found that use of air-dried soil samples provided the same ranking of treatments by a number of enzyme assays and would facilitate adoption of these assays for practical or commercial applications. Deaminase was not a good indicator of soil quality, while beta-glucosidase was suggested as an assay that reflects soil management effects and has microbial ecological significance because of its role in the C cycle.

AB Soil microorganisms and the processes that they govern are essential for long-term sustainability of agricultural systems, but most studies on agricultural effects on the soil microflora are inherently short-term. We investigated the effects of three aspects of agricultural intensification, i.e. cultivation (disturbance), herbicide addition (modification of plant composition) and mulching (resource addition) on soil biological properties such as microbial biomass and activity over 7 yr in annual (maize) and perennial (asparagus) cropping systems. The mulching treatment had strong, usually positive effects on both substrate-induced respiration (SIR) and CO2-C release from chloroform-fumigated soil throughout the study. In the perennial crop, treatments allowing high weed biomass caused large increases in microbial biomass and respiration after yr 3, and in both sites microbial biomass was positively correlated with weed biomass and negatively with crbp plant biomass. This latter effect appears due to the high decomposability of weed residues relative to those from crop plants. Microbial biomass was also enhanced in atrazine-treated plots in the annual crop but only during the final year, presumably due to beneficial effects of plot invasion by herbicide-tolerant weeds. Mulching often also enhanced the microbial metabolic quotient (qCO(2)), the bacteria-to-fungal biomass ratio and within-year temporal variability of the microbial biomass, all of which are indicative of greater turnover and instability of the microbial biomass. Other treatments generally had smaller effects on these properties, although in the perennial crop an intense summer drought in yr 4 caused a large elevation in the metabolic quotient in the herbicide-treated (low weed) plots relative to the other plots, suggesting that high quality weed residues have stabilising effects. Temporal variability across years of both SIR and C02-C release from fumigated soil was greatest in the herbicide-treated plots in the perennial crop, suggesting that high weed biomass (producing easily degradable organic matter) has stabilising effects. Decomposition rates of added litter were partially consistent with the microbial biomass data, with the highest litter breakdown rates usually occurring in the mulched plots. Our study shows that soil biological properties such as microbial biomass and activity are not necessarily adversely affected by agricultural intensification and that consequences of intensification mainly depend upon practices which alter the quality and quantity of residue inputs. Further, our results underline the need for long-term field experiments, and several of the effects we identified could only have been detected through an experiment of several years duration.

AB Land configuration in combination with nutrient management has the potential to improve the productivity of Alfisols and Vertisols in the semi-arid tropics. A four year (1989-1990 and 1992-1993) field experiment was conducted at Coimbatore, India on Alfisols (Chromic Cambisol) to compare the effect of land configuration and nutrient management practices on yield of rainfed sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench). The land configuration treatments were flat bed (FB, the traditional practice), open ridging (OR, ridges, 45 cm apart and 30 cm high) and tied ridging (TR, same as OR plus ridges were tied randomly). The manure and fertilisers were farm yard manure FYM, livestock excreta plus litter at 5 Mg ha(-1) and coir dust (CD, by-product after the extraction of coir from the coconut (Cocos nucifera L.) husk at 12.5 Mg ha(-1)) in combination with nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) fertiliser levels. Tied ridges stored 14% more soil water and produced 14% and 11% more grain and straw yields of sorghum, respectively, than did flat bed. However, crop yield in TR was comparable with OR. Application of CD at 12.5 Mg ha(-1) combined with 40 kg N ha(-1) and 9 kg P ha(-1) was beneficial for more soil water storage and increased yield of sorghum by 7% over FYM at 5 Mg ha(-1) + 40 kg N ha(-1) and 9 kg P ha(-1). In Vertisols (Vertic Cambisols), experiments were conducted for two years (1991-1992 and 1992-1993) to evaluate land configuration practices. The treatments were broad bed furrow (BBF, 120 cm wide bed with 30 cm wide and 15 cm deep furrows on both sides), compartmental bunding (CB, bunds of 15 cm height formed in all the four sides to form a check basin of 6 m x 5 m size), ridging (RD, ridges were formed for each and every row of the crop manually at four weeks after sowing) and FB under sorghum + pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp) and pearl millet (Pennisetum glacum (L.) Stuntz) + cowpea (Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp) intercropping separately. Compartmental bunding stored 22% more soil moisture and increased the yield of sorghum + pigeonpea intercropping than did FB in a low rainfall year. In a high rainfall year, BBF produced 34% and 33% more grain yield of sorghum and pearl millet base crops, respectively, over FB. However, BBF and CB were comparable. Pigeonpea intercrop under sorghum followed the same: trend as its base crop, whereas, yield of cowpea differed compared to the pearl millet base crop. Tied ridging and application of manures (CD or FYM) in combination with inorganic N and P fertiliser can increase the soil water storage and yield of crops compared to traditional flat bed cultivation in rainfed Alfisol and related soils of semi-arid tropics. Similarly BBF and CB land configuration practices could be adopted on Vertisols for better water conservation to increase the soil fertility and productivity of intercropping systems.

AB Forest-management practices relying on natural and/or artificial regeneration and domestication can significantly affect genetic diversity. The aim of the present study was to determine and compare the genetic diversity of the pristine old-growth, naturally and artificially regenerated and phenotypically selected white spruce, and to determine the genetic-diversity impacts of silvicultural practices. Genetic diversity was determined and compared for 51 random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) loci for the adjacent natural old-growth, naturally regenerated and planted white spruce stands at each of four sites, one oldest plantation and open-pollinated progeny of 30 phenotypic tree-improvement selections of white spruce from Saskatchewan. Each of the 420 white spruce individuals sampled was genetically unique. The old-growth stands had the highest, and the phenotypic selections the lowest, genetic diversity. The genetic diversity of the natural regeneration was comparable to that of the old-growth, whereas the genetic diversity of the plantations was comparable to that of the selections. On average, the genetic diversity of the old-growth and natural regeneration was significantly higher than that of the plantations and selections. The mean percent of loci polymorphic, the number of alleles per locust the effective number of alleles per locus, heterozygosity, and Shannon's index was 88.7, 83.8, 72.2 and 66.7; 1.89, 1.84, 1.72 and 1.67; 1.69, 1.62, 1.53 and 1.46; 0.381, 0.349, 0.297 and 0.259; and 0.548, 0.506, 0.431 and 0.381 for the old-growth stands; natural regeneration; plantations; and open-pollinated progeny of selections; respectively. Reduced genetic diversity in the plantations and selections suggest that their genetic base is relatively narrow, and should therefore be broadened in order to maintain genetic diversity, and sustainably manage and conserve white spruce genetic resources.

TI Peacebuilding and the new regionalism in southern Africa
SO THIRD WORLD QUARTERLY
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper investigates the complexities of establishing sustainable peacebuilding strategies in southern Africa within 'new' security/'new' regionalism contexts. Building peace requires initiatives based upon longer-term developmental, political, economic and social objectives. If peacebuilding is to fulfil its potential for the advancement of 'human' security in Southern Africa, these criteria will best be met through regional solutions. Yet, the new regionalism is multi-dimensional and the various regionalist forces are not necessarily compatible. Although national governments have made some efforts toward the development of a regional security complex, strong statist and realist tendencies persist at official levels and regionalist pressures within civil societies as well as by external actors tend to be mixed and often contradictory. Apart from a widespread recognition in South Africa of the need to give a bottom-up perspective on the question 'who is security all about?', there has been a growing recognition throughout the region as a whole of the desirability of a regional dimension to the security referent.(1)

TI Sustainability of fiscal policy in Mexico
SO TRIMESTRE ECONOMICO
LA Spanish
DT Article
ID DEFICITS
AB This paper studies the sustainability of the fiscal policy for Mexico, according to the behavior of the Government budget restriction and the balance in the accumulated debt over the last two decades. We use the value of the debt and the empirical analysis is based in Wilcox (1989), were it is required that the debt process is stationary and its no conditional mean is equal to zero. Our results suggest that the fiscal policy, for the period between 1980-1997, is not sustainable. These results are not conclusive due to the instability in the parameters of the univariate process in the debt series. When the analysis is realized for the period between 1988.III-1997.IV, the results suggest that for this term the fiscal policy is sustainable, while for most of the eighties it was not.

TI Homegardens - a neglected potential for food security and sustainable
   land management in the communal lands of Zimbabwe
SO TROPENLANDWIRT
LA English
DT Article
AB Home gardening plays an important role within the overall farming and livelihood system in Southern Zimbabwe in terms of household food security and income generation. Homegardening is an ideal complement to crop production which is mainly concentrated in the off-season.
   The paper describes homegardening systems in the semi-arid areas. Major differences between individual gardens and gardens promoted by development agents revealed in terms of species diversity. Whereas 'supported gardens' are geared towards optimal production, multiple and diverse goals are pursued in individual gardens which due to their rich species diversity are a stronghold of biodiversity conservation. This raised the question whether development efforts should not learn from individual gardens and choose different approaches.
   The highest potential to improve crop management gardens which were identified were effective water management, biological pest control and intercropping. Promising methods for water harvesting are being tested and practised, but little research on the use of natural biological antagonists for pest control has been done so far. Soil fertility management in gardens was revealed as highly effective. In contrast to the main fields, organic matter is relatively high in the gardens.
   The paper concludes that the support of home gardens would be an important contribution to strengthening food security and biodiversity for ecological stability. Areas needing extension support include: methods of improving water use efficiency, storage and marketing of home garden products. With respect to its contribution to sustainable land use, food security and ecological stability home gardens should not be addressed in isolation. An integrated approach to improve the security of livelihood making use of the positive complementarity of the field crop production, livestock and gathering of fruits etc. should be aimed for. However, an altitudinal problem needs to be overcome: fruit gathering and many other 'traditional' practices which offer a Ist of potential to improve gardening are perceived as 'uncivilised' and 'backward' compared to modern technology like fertiliser and pesticides. These, however, are expensive and few farmers only utilise them in gardens.

TI Enhancing professional agricultural education in development
   co-operation - Adaptability of the dual system in different
   socio-economic contexts
SO TROPENLANDWIRT
LA English
DT Article
AB Unemployment continues to be one of the most serious problems in developing countries. The lack a profound and efficient systems of vocational education which can meet the challenges of rapid technological development and socio-economic change have to be considered an important cause. The German system of vocational education, normally referred to as the Dual System, has recently attracted many Third World Governments as a guideline for the improvement of professional education. This paper intends to assess activities of the German Institute for Tropical and Subtropical Agriculture (DITSL), Witzenhausen for the assistance in implementing an improved system of professional education based on the German experience. Between 1985 and 1998 almost 200 Moroccan agricultural professionals have been trained. In 1990 the German Agency for Technical Go-operation started a bilateral aid project which had the purpose of establishing the dual system of professional education in the agricultural sector of Morocco. The chosen approach, i.e. starting formal training five years prior to the proper project, has proven to be a decisive factor for success. In 1998/99 an effective dual system of vocational training had been implemented. Countrywide 1,200 training farms had been recognised which cared for 2,434 trainees. 35 Technical Schools with 300 trained teachers were integrated in the system.
   Technical vocational education in the Republic of Indonesia has been developed during the past 25 years by the establishment of a total of 3.685 Vocational Secondary Schools. Important steps have been taken by Government to match technical vocational education with the requirements of the economy by placing more weight on practical instruction in the curricula. Nevertheless, in consideration of the numerous constraints officials from the Ministry of Education and Culture came together with DITSL staff in 1996 in order to plan a co-operation programme. The objective was to introduce key elements of the German dual system of professional education into the existing Indonesian framework. As a result the implementation of a pilot training course has been implemented. This was considered a first step and a long-term co-operation programme is required in order to achieve a sustainable success.

AB Preliminary studies were conducted in 1990 wet and 1991 dry seasons to evaluate the effects of mound-tillage (MT), ridge-tillage (RT), and no-tillage (NT) planting systems on soil properties and yield of maize in the sub-humid area of south-western Nigeria. Soil moisture retention in the 30-cm top layer was in the order (P < 0.01) NT > RT > MT. Air-filled pore spaces of the same depth zone was in the reverse order (P < 0.01). Total N content at first planting and final harvest was 0.11 and 0.20%, 0.24 and 0.19%, and 0.04 and 0.19% at No in IV1, IV2, and IV3, respectively. In the 1990 wet season, MT significantly (P < 0.01) produced higher yields than NT and RT in green maize in IV2 and IV3, whether fertilized or not. In the 1991 dry season, the differences were also highly significant (P < 0.01) in IV3, where the fertilized MT and RT plots produced more green maize than the NT plot. The study demonstrated that MT with fertilizer would lead to sustainable increases in crop yields in valley bottom soils.

ID CITIES
AB The growing debate around sustainable cities has generated a substantial academic and policy literature. It is becoming increasingly clear that there are a number of different approaches being considered. This article develops four models of sustainable urban development from this literature, ranging from light green to deep green in their underlying environmental philosophy. The models are then used as the framework for analysing four different experiments in sustainable urban development in the city of Adelaide, South Australia, which broadly fit into the four models. Overall, the models are useful in highlighting the different underlying rationales of the four approaches, although they also show that in the process of trying to gain political favour there is a fair amount of 'ideological capture' in respect of the rhetorics and the practice of sustainable urban development.

TI On the limnology of Spioenkop, a turbid reservoir on the upper Thukela

ID SOUTH-AFRICA; ZOOPLANKTON
AB Basic Features of the physical and biological limnology of Spioenkop, a large turbid impoundment on the Thukela River, were studied between July 1989 and May 1990, following surveys in spring 1987 and 1988. The lake showed a typical monomictic pattern of summer stratification (November through April) and holomictic winter circulation (May to October). Water quality was chemically good, with little evidence of nutrient enrichment (South African DWAF records). Biological production was confined by high turbidity (SD around 25 cm, NTU values of ca 90) imposed by suspended sediments, limiting annual maximum surface chlorophyll content to below 5 mu g.l(-1), and spring primary production to < 500 mg C.m(-2).d(-1).
   Zooplankton was dominated (numerically and/or gravimetrically) by typical turbid-water fauna; the copepods Metadiaptomus colonialis and Lovenula falcifera, and cladocerans Daphnia barbata and Moina micrura. These species and other tai;a present showed considerable seasonal periodicity, but maximal total abundance of the entire community (680 mg.mg(-2) DW) was attained in mid-summer. Limited information regarding littoral zoobenthos and fish is provided.
   Considerations of Spioenkop as a mirror of its catchment, and in relation to the major Thukela-Vaal inter-basin transfer scheme invite critical appraisal of the level of scientific knowledge and understanding. The plea and challenge is made for more holistic and integrated approaches to ensure sustainable environmental management.

DT Article
ID FISCAL DEFICITS; INTEREST-RATES
AB The paper develops theoretical frameworks to explain the phenomena of seigniorage, dollarization, and public debt; and then applies them to the Lebanese macroeconomic situation over 1982-97. More specifically, it analyzes the implications of seigniorage and dollarization to see what extent they were responsible for the inflation and exchange rate depreciations during the civil war period. It also studies the sustainability of postwar debt. The conclusions that emerge from the analysis are that budget deficits were only one of the reasons behind the war inflation and depreciations, dollarization could still impose some problems for macroeconomic stability, and tax reforms are essential for fiscal balance.

AB Worldwide implementation of the central concept sustainable development has given rise to very different interpretations, some extending to central issues within the field of ecological ethics. This is especially true of the two economic approaches termed "strong" and "weak" sustainability. With reference to findings from economic and ecological research, this article endeavours to show that the outlined theological ethical basis negates reception of "weak" sustainability, whereas the "strong" sustainability theory merits interdisciplinary consideration through a theologically oriented ethics of sustainable development.

ID ALUMINUM; CALCIUM; LENGTH; GROWTH
AB The potential of fine roots as indicators of forest sustainability is discussed. In 10 oak (Quercus petraea, Q. robur) trials, where moderate doses of lime had been applied up to 27 years ago, the effects on soil, root and foliar chemical parameters were compared with above- and below-ground growth. The effects of liming on growth appeared positive and sustained for ca. 25 years after application, whereas effects on soil, root, and foliar chemical parameters only lasted for 10-25 years. Fine-root biomass or length appeared to be significantly increased by liming and comparable to the effects on above-ground tree growth, but were considered to be too time-consuming for use as indicators of ecosystem function. A combination of soil and root chemical parameters predicted fine-root mass and length the best - and thus tree growth - with foliar chemical parameters being of minor importance. When this best-fitting linear regression model was applied, separately for both the lime treatment and the control, the contribution of root chemical parameters in the model decreased in the lime treatment as compared to the control, while that of foliar chemical parameters increased. Consequently, root as well as soil chemical parameters appeared to be more sensitive to changes in the chemical status of the site.
   In general it is recommended, that studies aiming to define useful indicators, should start with a feasibility study (e.g. comparing the utility of soil, root and foliar chemical parameters) before defining a smaller set of most sensitive parameters. For the sites examined, a combination of parameters such as fine-root Ca, Al, Mg, Ca/Al, Mg/Al, soil exchangeable Ca, Al, and Mg gave a good insight into the actual uptake capacity of roots or constraints on that capacity.

AB Long-term productivity of mixed-species forests in the central Appalachian region of the United States may be threatened by changes in base cation availability of the soil. These changes may be due to increased intensity of harvest removals and a shift toward shorter rotations that result in increased removal of calcium and magnesium in aboveground biomass, and through altered nutrient cycling. Atmospheric deposition, particularly of nitrogen, also affects nutrient cycling by increasing leaching of base cations from the soil in soil solution, and by altering the rate of nutrient cycling. In this paper, I present evidence for nitrogen saturation of forested ecosystems in the central Appalachians, discuss the symptoms and implications for productivity as well as the effects of changes in timber harvesting rates and intensity on nutrient cycling, and evaluate the potential for interaction between these two stressors. Indicators of changes in productivity of extensively managed forests due to base cation depletion are also discussed. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The overall effects of fire on ecosystems are complex, ranging from the reduction or elimination of aboveground biomass to impacts on belowground physical, chemical and microbial mediated processes. Since a key component of overall ecosystem sustainability occurs belowground, recovery is tied to the soil's physical, chemical, and biological functions and processes. Depending on several fire severity measures, changes in belowground components can be either beneficial or deleterious to the entire ecosystem. Low-impact burning can promote a herbaoeous flora, increase plant available nutrients, and thin overcrowded forests, all of which can foster healthy systems. Severe fires can often cause changes in successional rates, alter above- and belowground species composition, generate volatilization of nutrients and ash entrainment in smoke columns, produce rapid or decreased mineralization rates, alter C : N ratios, and result in subsequent nutrient losses through accelerated erosion, leaching or denitrification. In addition, changes in soil hydrologic functioning, degradation of soil physical properties, decreases in micro- and macrofauna, and alterations in microbial populations and associated processes can occur. The direct effect of fire on belowground systems is a result of the burning severity, which integrates aboveground fuel loading (live and dead), soil moisture and subsequent soil temperatures, and duration of the burn. The time for recovery of belowground systems will not only depend on the burning intensity and its effect on key ecosystem processes and components, but also on the previous land-use practices. Thus, the impacts of fire on belowground systems can be highly variable and may not be predictable. Our paper is a general review of the effects of fire on belowground systems with emphasis placed on the changes in physical. biogeochemical and biological properties of soils and the resulting consequences these changes have for ecosystem sustainability.

AB Sustainable management of forest resources, including nutrient retention and protection of the soil structure, is required to ensure long-term soil fertility and productivity of later rotations. Potential depletion of soil nutrients is particularly likely in production systems based on fast-growing trees, such as eucalypts, We have studied production of second rotation Eucalyptus globulus stands at two sites in northern Spain and two in central Portugal, after replanting or coppicing. under four treatments, in which plant residues from the first crop were utilised, The residues were either removed from the sites (Treatment R), spread over the soil surface (Treatments S, uniform spreading, and W, in which the woody debris was confined to rows between the trees) or incorporated into the soil by harrowing to 15-cm depth (Treatment I). We measured tree height and girth at intervals over three growing seasons, and root biomass at the Portuguese sites. Decomposition of three residue components: leaves-plus-bark, twigs and branches, was measured in litter bags placed in the position corresponding to the placement of the organic residues.
   By the end of the experiment, tree height was significantly greater in Treatment I than in Treatment R at both Spanish sites, if planted as seedlings, with intermediate growth in S and W, In Portugal, tree height was smaller in R, though not significantly. DBH showed similar trends, although treatment differences were not significant. Coppiced trees grew faster than seedling trees, but a significant treatment effect on the growth was only observed at the inland Portuguese site, where it was better in Treatment I by the end of the experiment,
   The residues decomposed significantly faster in I than S or W at the Portuguese sites, but not in Spain. Leaves-plus-bark decomposed faster than twigs, and twigs faster than branches.
   The results are discussed in relation to recommended management options. (C); 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Vector analyses have been used to examine the effects of harvest residues on the growth of Sitka spruce planted 18 months after clearfelling a first rotation of the same species. Four treatments were imposed at the time of planting: retention of all residues; retention of fine twigs and foliage; placement of coarse branch material onto plots; and removal of all harvest residues. Sample trees were harvested each year for five years after planting and the biomass and nutrient contents of whole crowns were quantified.
   Harvest residues had a large effect on mean tree height (p < 0.001). Coarse and fine components produced similar increases when compared to plots with no residues although the response to fine material occurred earlier. After five years, residues had increased mean tree height by 40%. Residues also increased the mean dry weight per tree although the response to coarse material was not significant until the age of five years, at which time trees in residues had 166% more biomass (p< 0.001). Tree growth was greatest where both forms of residue were retained on site.
   Interpretation of vector nomograms, foliage concentrations and concentration ratios indicated that the growth response was unlikely to he related to changes in nutrient supply for the first two years of treatment. Early treatment effects may have been mediated through changes in weed competition or microclimate. After three years, treatment effects were likely to have been related to altered nutrient supply, particularly those for nitrogen and potassium. According to vector analyses, potassium was not limiting tree growth in whole-tree harvested plots although foliage levels were below critical levels for young Sitka spruce and potassium : nitrogen ratios indicated a nutrient imbalance in these plots. Such an imbalance may arise from the rapid loss of potassium from decomposing harvest residues accompanied by a more gradual release of nitrogen that may relate more closely to the nutrient demand of newly planted trees.
   The contention that vector analyses allow a standardized comparison between treatments without confounding with other factors has to be questioned. In the present study, different interpretations resulted from analyses based on comparing samples of different age-classes or from different canopy positions. The method has also been shown to be very sensitive to the choice of critical test statistic used in assessing each vector component. We conclude that vector analyses can provide a useful visualization of treatment effects on tree growth and nutrition, Its relevance to the assessment of sustainable forest management is limited by the need to have treatment comparisons available and interpretations should be corroborated by other evidence before firm conclusions can be drawn.

AB New Zealand has signed an international agreement that commits it to report on progress towards sustainable forest management as measured by indicators grouped within seven criteria. This paper evaluates the role of forest productivity in defining the sustainability of plantation forests in New Zealand. A key factor dictating the extent of the plantation forest industry in New Zealand is profitability. Therefore, forest productivity is an important criterion of sustainability because of its important relationship with economics and profitability. Another important issue is whether plantations could be grown for an indefinite number of rotations without adversely affecting the site's capacity for biomass production. Where management practices lead to reductions in productivity, some form of amelioration is required and, as long as this is economically viable the practice is still sustainable. Forest productivity is not a good indicator of soil quality because of the confounding effects of plantation management. While improved modeling techniques may help to overcome this problem, measurement of soil- or tree-based indicators may provide a more sensitive measurement of soil quality. For a given soil type, if the effect of management practices on the soil indicator and the effect of the soil indicator on forest productivity were known, then an assessment could be made of the impact of various management practices on productivity (or other sustainability criteria). This would allow the establishment of management guidelines, constraints, and ameliorative requirements necessary to maintain or enhance soil quality. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Maintaining, and if possible increasing, soil fertility is a major goal for sustainable forest management, because it determines to a large extent the site's capacity for wood production. As, generally, forest soils are poor, and the demand for wood is still increasing, the boundary of resilience of each ecosystem must be known.
   Several cases must be identified: the case of natural or native species forests, either planted or not, which are extensively managed and the case of intensively managed plantations,
   In this paper. input-output budgets are calculated according to temporal and spatial scales. The measurement of the main inputs and outputs is discussed.
   When all the fluxes entering and leaving the selected compartment are measured, the budget provides a realistic picture of the direction of change in soil fertility. In other cases, the validity of the budget has to be considered according to the proposed hypothesis.
   A balanced budget means that the element considered is not depleted from the soil. This does not mean that no changes occur in the ecosystem. A positive budget means that the element considered is accumulating in the system, which is not always favorable. A negative budget means the element considered is depleted in the system, but it has to be related to the available soil reserves and to the rate of flux into available pool to be a real index of risk for the ecosystem.
   Information from several case studies shows the interest of these budgets because (i) they are able to characterize depletion before the direct analysis of the system would be able to indicate it, and (ii) they give useful quantitative data for recommendations applicable to forest management. These budgets have the disadvantage of being labor-intensive and expensive. They are also site-specific and give little direct information for identifying the mechanisms of nutrient tranformations within the ecosystem. The relationships between forest production and nutrient availability are not sufficiently known to be able to quantify the variation in production when nutrient depletion is observed.
   On account of the difficulty in calculating such a budget, the most efficient strategy could be the following: (i) calculate budgets in a representative network of sites; (ii) relate the individual budgets to more easily available parameters; and (iii) propose more simple indicators for managers.

AB A general goal of the forestry sector in many countries is developing and applying best management practices that will result in sustainable forestry. Maintaining soil productivity is a criterion in most sustainability initiatives. The purpose of this paper is to outline the steps and rationale of a monitoring approach, using soil-based indicators as an example, to assess stand-level sustainability of intensively managed forests. The monitoring process, described here, includes steps that establish the proper inference space, identify soil functions, attributes, and indicators, combine indicator responses in a soil quality model, establish baseline conditions for comparing soil change, validate relationships between indicators and soil productivity, and implement a sampling scheme to measure indicators, analyze trends, and interpret change for adapting Sustainable Forestry Practises (SFPs) to maximize their effectiveness. This monitoring process is proposed as a method for SFP research and development that will lead to sustainable forest management at the unit level. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Maintenance and enhancement of soil productivity is central to the long-term success of intensive forest management. A simple technique is required for monitoring the effects of different management practices on soils as an aid in developing codes of practice that foster maintenance and enhancement of soil productivity. The objective of our work was to determine if management impacts on soil productivity could be assessed using the soil-quality concepts developed in agriculture. A soil-quality index (SQI) model, that measures the effects of management practices on five key growth-determining attributes of forest soils. namely (1) promote root growth, (2) store, supply and cycle nutrients, (3) accept, hold, and supply water, (4) promote gas exchange, and (5) promote biological activity, was developed and rested as part of a controlled study in intensively-managed pine plantations on the Lower Coastal Plain of South Carolina. Three 20-ha, 20-year-old loblolly pine plantations were harvested under wet and dry conditions to create a broad gradient in soil disturbance. Within each harvested plantation, a subset of 3-ha plots were site prepared by either bedding or mole-plowing plus bedding, then all sites were established as third-rotation pine plantations. Field data were collected spatially for soil bulk density, net N mineralization, water table depth, soil aeration, and soil moisture. Literature-based sufficiency values were determined for each property and substituted into the SQI model as surrogate indicators for the five key attributes, thus obtaining spatial SQI predictions within each harvesting and site preparation treatment. Our study results demonstrate how SQI monitoring could be used to identify the effects of management practices on soil productivity, which should aid in developing codes of practice as a component of achieving long-term sustainability in domesticated forests.

AB A scheme for combining forest data (growth, foliar nutrition) and soil and site information in a predictive spatial system is proposed to address the following questions: Can geostatistics be used to produce maps of forest sustainability indicator variables such as tree growth or foliage and soil properties to show spatial and temporal trends? Can soil map units be used to stratify forests according to certain criteria and what are the implications of such a stratification on sampling needs? Is a GIS the logical tool for analysis and presentation of trends?
   We concluded that geostatistics is a valid tool for estimating and interpreting spatial trends in growth (site index) and foliar data (foliar P), but that in the study area available soil and foliage data was too sparse for confident use of this technique. Soil map units were used to stratify the study forest for growth, foliar P nutrition and soil P concentration, but at the selected map scale this only led to sampling efficiencies for the foliar N data.
   A modelled example of how the GIS and soil map units could be used to illustrate predicted changes in productivity and P status over space and time was presented. Soils were ranked according to their resilience to changes in P status based on initial soil P concentration, soil volume, and P fixing character. Likely changes in foliar P concentration in P. radiata stands on such sites were estimated over two rotations and changes in overall forest productivity predicted.
   In this study, based on existing available forest data, it became apparent that monitoring systems for site quality will not be able to depend on such data alone, and structured explicit sampling designs will be needed to address the requirements of long-term monitoring programmes. Tree-based indicators will be easier and cheaper to monitor than soil-based indicators, but a mix of both indicator types is likely in future schemes. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB The early critique of undifferentiated, undirected growth, emerging from the north as well as the south, has been diluted over the years. The idea of 'sustainable development' co-opted social and environmental agendas into a mainstream now geared to market liberalisation and globalisation. It is time; to reassess and join forces in a new critique of growth, and redefine progress.

TI Institutional management regimes for pricing of irrigation water: the
   French model - lessons for India
SO AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
DE participatory approach; users' association; cost recovery; pricing of
   irrigation water; financial autonomy; decentralised management
AB In France, the River Basin Committees and Water Agencies are in-charge of managing water resources. However, many surface irrigation networks were initiated and operated by the Regional Companies and farmer syndicates exclusively for agricultural development in the southwest of the country. These are water institutions playing an active role in water management with an objective of cost recovery in order to improve the quality of irrigation services to the users. The implementation of various innovative institutional management approaches by these agencies have yielded a modest degree of success in addressing the crucial problems of the irrigation sector in terms of pricing water, cost recovery, financial viability and overall sustainability of the surface irrigation system. This study attempts to examine the relevance of the institutional management approaches of France to the Indian context. The institutional framework for setting the price of irrigation water is through negotiation between the management and the user representatives. The important lessons drawn based on the experiences of the French model include the granting of financial autonomy to the water institutions in order to recover operational and maintenance costs, participatory approaches of decentralised management, user involvement in the decision-making process, devolution of small-scale irrigation networks to the users for management and the promotion of effective and viable user associations with access to technical information relating to the use of irrigation technologies.

ID NITROGEN; CONSEQUENCES; GROWTH
AB An assessment of environmental issues that might emerge in the 21(st) century suggests that the high priority issues will be:
   Transformations of old issues-continually evolving, and In most cases broadening, in response to increasing scientific and technological knowledge and to changing socioeconomic, cultural and environmental conditions. For example, the issues of sustainable water use, urbanization and natural disasters will change in character as a result of climate warming, economic development and evolving cultural norms. This means that environmental policies ought to be adaptive, and should be supported by early warning systems, using appropriate indicators. -
   Policy issues, the long-term environmental consequences of which may already be of concern, e.g., the growing water shortages in parts of Africa, and the longterm environmental impacts of direct foreign investment and of changing world trade patterns. The implications of many such socioeconomic and cultural trends on the environment are yet to unfold, and need to be given serious attention.
   Accidents waiting to happen, e.g., chemical time bombs. -
   Surprises, in the responses of ecosystems to new and different stresses, as well as in the nature of the socioeconomic drivers of environmental change.

ID SUSTAINABILITY
AB The measure of value called emergy is used to evaluate the flows of energy and resources that sustain the biosphere including the economy of humans. A donor system of value based on solar emergy required to produce things is suggested as the only means of reversing the logic trap inherent in economic valuation, which suggests that value stems only from utilization by humans. The stocks of natural capital and flows of environmental resources are evaluated in emergy and related to Global World Product, Several emergy indices are introduced as a means of evaluating sustainability of economies and processes. The total emergy flux of the biosphere is composed of 32% renewable flows of sunlight, tidal momentum and deep heat (it was 68% in 1950), and 68% slowly-renewable and nonrenewable flows. An index of environmental loading on the biosphere is shown to have increased about 4 times since 1950, while an index of global sustainability suggests that overall, sustainability of the global economy has precipitously declined.

SO AMBIO
LA English
DT Article
AB Dramatic environmental changes are occurring in the Zhujiang (Pearl River) Delta where dike-pond agriculture-aquaculture has been practiced for centuries. After Deng Xiaoping's economic reforms, serious environmental degradation has triggered far-reaching alterations in the agroaquaculture structure, spatial pattern, and species variety especially in the municipalities of Shunde and Nanhai. Following the decline in the raising of traditional Chinese carps in ponds in the late 1980s, the development of a more sophisticated and intensive monoculture has emerged. The market-oriented, high-valued monocultural systems, focusing primarily on expanding pond surface to raise production value per (pond) unit, tend to boost economic growth at the expense of ecological benefits. This study (1984-1994) was conducted to detect changes in the dike-pond areal ratio, and to raise questions about the sustainability of the new monocultural systems.

ID TRANSITION; DISABILITY; MORTALITY; DISEASE
AB Recent data on the burden of mental disorders worldwide demonstrates a major public health problem that affects patients, society, and nations as a whole. Research must be done to find effective ways to deal with the increasing burden of mental disorders. Given the growing evidence that mental disorders are disorders of the brain and that they can be treated effectively with both psychosocial counseling and psychotropic medications, intervention packages could be developed to deal with the increasing burden. Such packages should be tested for real-world effectiveness and their cost-effectiveness should be demonstrated to guide policymakers to choose from among many other non-mental health interventions. The transportability and sustainability of intervention packages should be studied in public health research and a link between efficacy, effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, generalizability, and sustainability should be demonstrated.
   The World Health Organization's initiative on the World Mental Health 2000 Survey will provide the first basic epidemiologic data. Together with other data, the initiative wilt provide solid evidence for including mental disorders into essential treatment packages. In this way,parity can be achieved for mental disorders and mental health can be mainstreamed into health and public health practice.

AB Malaria remains the most important parasitic cause of mortality in humans. Its presentation is thought to vary according to the intensity of Plasmodium falciparum transmission. However, detailed descriptions of presenting features and risk factors for death are only available from moderate transmission settings. Such descriptions help to improve case management and identify priority research areas. Standardized systematic procedures were used to collect clinical and laboratory data on 6,624 children admitted to hospital over a 1-year period in an intensely malarious part of Tanzania. Frequencies of signs and symptoms were calculated and their association with a fatal outcome was assessed using multivariate logistic regression. There were 72 deaths among 2,432 malaria cases (case fatality rate [CFR] = 3.0%); 44% of the cases and 54% of the deaths were in individuals less than 1 year of age. There was no association between level of parasitemia and CFR. Increased risk of dying was independently found in all children with hypoglycemia (odds ratio [OR] = 6.7, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 3.9-11.7), in children 1-7 months of age with tachypnea (OR = 8.8, 95% CI = 2.6-30.5) and dehydration (OR = 5.0, 95% CI = 1.9-14.2), and in children 8 months to 4 years of age with chest indrawing (OR = 4.7, 95% CI = 2.0-11.2) and inability to localize a painful stimulus (OR = 6.9, 95% CI = 2.9-16.5). Children in the bottom quartile of weight-for-age were more likely to die (OR = 2.1, 95% CI = 1.3-3.5). Eight percent of the malaria cases had severe anemia (packed cell volume < 15%) but 24% received a blood transfusion. The epidemiology of malaria disease may be more complex than previously thought. Improved case management in a wide variety of health facilities may result from adequate identification and treatment of dehydration and hypoglycemia. Transfusion-requiring anemia is a major problem and sustainable, effective preventive measures are urgently needed.

AB A correct waste management is one of the main aspects of an environmental policy. Sustainability indicators represent a tool that makes it possible for the policy maker to evaluate alternative scenarios on a scientific basis, both on a, local and a national level. In this paper we propose the use of the indicators based on the energy concept for the assessment of waste management in the local government of Modena. From this study we can conclude that waste represents an enormous amount of energy, that is, of past work of the biosphere and thus it has to be used as a resource. In emergy terms, investment in the collection of waste is negligible. The; most sustainable collection in Modena is that of bulky objects, glass, paper and materials for compost. Modena's incinerator shows good efficiency in yielding electricity and a good control of emissions. In the future it will be important to reduce the total amount of waste to be burned, in order to maintain low emissions of CO2.

AB A full Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) has been developed for a case study of the car tyre. The results have been compared with those obtained by applying to the same case different LCA streamlining methods in order to understand the differences. The principle of "reliability", which is the necessary condition of the streamlining methods, is evaluated for the specific case of the car tyre. Moreover some aspects of the methodology whose elaboration in one way or another can lead to drastic changes in the results are identified. In particular, space and time aspects are discussed and options for their assessment are briefly described.

AB Trees integrated with crops in time and/or space mediate nutrient cycling on farms by increasing the supply and availability of nutrients in the crop root zone and reducing nutrient losses. However, quantitative information is lacking on biological nitrogen fixation and nutrients recycled in semi-arid agroforestry due to the control of losses by trees, and most information available is on nutrients recycled through their above- and below-ground biomass. The potential for exploiting nutrient cycling in simultaneous agroforestry systems is constrained by a low and erratic water supply in the semi-arid areas of Africa. In parkland systems, there is a limited scope for increasing nutrient cycling because of the small quantity of biomass added into soil from low tree density in the system. However, trees in these traditional systems are more important for economic products in terms of poles; timber, fruits, etc., and have ecological benefits such as the reduction of nutrient and water losses. Although hedgerow intercropping uses high tree density and increases the nitrogen (N) supply in the soil, crops nevertheless fail to benefit due to competition between trees and crops for water. Contour hedgerows can conserve nutrients by arresting soil erosion on moderately sloping lands and are worthy of consideration for both soil conservation and fodder production. Mixed intercropping of Gliricidia septum and maize with efficient tree management appears to be promising in some areas and needs further testing before widespread dissemination. Sequential systems with short-duration leguminous trees and shrubs, exemplified by 2-year Sesbania sesban rotated with crops, and biomass transfer systems are both efficient in nutrient cycling and increasing crop yields. Therefore, these systems can be considered for dissemination depending on the socio-econornic conditions. The potential for using biomass transfer systems is constrained by the availability of biomass outside the farms, land for its production on farms and labor for its application. Although these agroforestry systems provide an adequate quantity of N for moderate cereal yields, they cannot meet the phosphorus (P) requirements of crops in P-deficient soils, which should be supplemented through inorganic P sources. Nutrient cycling using livestock is less efficient due to N losses by volatilization and leaching than direct use of biomass as green manure. The use of palatable and high quality biomass as fodder is three to five times more economical than green manure. While agroforestry clearly has a definite role to increase nutrient cycling in low input systems, no single technology can guarantee controlling nutrient depletion in the long term; The choice of different technologies to suit different niches of the farm and their integration with inorganic nutrients is important for sustainable production even on smallholders' farms in the semi-arid Africa.

AB Livestock-based agroforestry systems present important opportunities for increasing food production from farm animals. This is reflected in the widening gap between production and consumption, and the inability of domestic supplies to meet projected demand for foods of animal origin up to year 2020. Increasing productivity from animals thus necessitates assessment of all possible avenues of food production, including agroforestry systems. In South-east Asia alone, this concerns an estimated 210 million hectares under permanent tree crops and forests. The livestock-tree interactions include animal draught power for land cultivation and crop growth; effects of dung and urine on soil fertility and crop growth; use of crop residues and agro-industrial by-products; use of native vegetation on cost of weed control; effects of integrating livestock with trees, and that of the shade of trees on animal performance; and type of production systems on crop performance and environmental protection. Case studies are presented, data from which clearly demonstrate positive benefits, economic and ecological impacts. Areas for research include characterization of livestock-based agroforestry systems in target agro-ecological zones; compatibility between livestock and trees; appropriate choice of livestock species, production systems, and optimum age of trees for integration with livestock; effects of dung and urine and nutrient recycling on soil fertility and crop yields; efficient use of crop residues and a,oro-industrial by-products in situ; and assessment of the nature, extent and implications of the interactions. Increased resource use and concerted research focus on livestock-based agroforestry systems can provide for demonstrable improved efficiency in the management of natural resources, sustainable production systems, and increased productivity from the land in the future.

AB European colonialism entailed material and conceptual landscape transformations that continue to define the parameters for postcolonial development. The major conceptual Landscape transformation, termed the "pristine myth" for the Americas, remains a cultural foundation for the binary categorization of the world into a rationally progressive West versus an irrationally traditional non-West, thus driving the social and environmental contradictions of postcolonial development efforts, Despite much evidence that contradicts the pristine myth-the myth in postcolonial development-it retains a pernicious grip on the Western popular imagination because attempts to falsify it have not demonstrated its emergence through a colonial process that materially and conceptually transformed landscapes while simultaneously obscuring such transformation. Study of sixteenth-century landscape transformation in the environs of the port of Veracruz demonstrates the significance of a material-conceptual, positive-feedback process in the emergence of a myth of increasingly rational land-use over the course of the colonial and postcolonial periods, when, in fact, the opposite transformation has occurred. That landscape served as the beachhead for the Spanish colonization of North America and thus influenced the initial conceptualization of New Spain, as well as undergoing some of the earliest material transformations due to disease and livestock introductions. Although this occurred early in the process of global colonization, a detailed database of land-grant documents enables reconstruction of interactions among population, vegetation, livestock, and categories of land use, cover, and tenure. Identification of such key variables in a positive-feedback process that simultaneously transformed landscape and obscured that transformation tentatively provides the basis for a more general falsification of the myth in postcolonial development.

TI Community-directed, ivermectin-treatment programmes for onchocerciasis
   control in Uganda: the selection and validation of indicators for
   monitoring sustainability at the district level
SO ANNALS OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND PARASITOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB The selection and validation of indicators for predicting and monitoring sustainment in community-directed, ivermectin-treatment programmes (CDITP) at the community level in the Kabale, Kisoro and Rukungiri districts of Uganda have already been reported. The aim of the present study was to select and validate similar indicators at the district level, in the same districts over the same 4-year period. Three dependent-variable scales of programme sustainability (PS), PS1, PS2 and PS3, were compared by district. As at the community level, Rukungiri district clearly performed better than Kabale or Kisoro.
   Cost variables compiled at the district level and the ratios of numbers of community-based distributors (CBD) to community members were used as input variables in regression and correlation models, with PS1, PS2, and PS3 as outcome variables.
   In the regression model, cost of training CBD was found to be statistically significant (P = 0.0186). This variable also scored 100% on a scale for programme-indicator sensitivity and hence was selected as a helpful indicator.
   In the correlation model, cost of health education of community members had a weak relationship with PS1 (P = 0.0662). Cost of training CBD had a significant negative correlation with PS2 (P = 0.0186), indicating that reducing the cost of training would facilitate sustainability. PS3 showed weak negative correlations with cost of health education of community members (P = 0.0586) and cost/person treated in the district (P = 0.0584). Sustainment of CDITP might be better, therefore, if the costs per person could be reduced. As correlation relationships may not be linear, however, they were not considered particularly useful in the selection of helpful indicators.

AB There is an intimate connection between energy, the environment and sustainable development. A society seeking sustainable development ideally must utilize only energy resources which cause no environmental impact (e.g. which release no emissions to the environment). However, since all energy resources lead to some environmental impact, it is reasonable to suggest that some (not all) of the concerns regarding the limitations imposed on sustainable development by environmental emissions and their negative impacts can be in part overcome through increased energy efficiency. Clearly, a strong relation exists between energy efficiency and environmental impact since, for the same services or products, less resource utilization and pollution is normally associated with increased energy efficiency. Presented in this paper are (i) a comprehensive discussion of the future of energy use and the consequent environmental impacts in terms of acid precipitation, stratospheric ozone depletion and the greenhouse effect, (ii) some solutions to current environmental issues in terms of energy conservation and renewable energy technologies, (iii) some theoretical and practical limitations on increased energy efficiency, (iv) discussions of the relations between energy and sustainable development, and between the environment and sustainable development, and an (v) illustrative example. In this regard, a number of issues relating to energy, environment and sustainable development are examined from both current and future perspectives. In addition, some recommendations are drawn from the results we present for the use of energy scientists and engineers and policy makers, along with the anticipated effects.

AB Nematode communities were monitored for three years in a citrus soil ecosystem in Central Florida under various agricultural regimes comparing standard vs, reduced-input practices. Differences in agricultural regimes consisted of two fertilization levels, two irrigation levels, and two types of ground cover under the tree (herbicide vs. mulch). While some nematodes were affected sporadically by fertilization and irrigation treatments, mulch had a consistent and frequently significant effect on many bacterivores, fungivores, herbivores, and omnivores. Rhabitidae, Cephalobus, Aphelenchus, and Aphelenchoides had an immediate but temporary response to mulch additions. Acrobeles, Acrobeloides, Eucephalobus, Teratocephalus, Criconemoides, Aporcelaimellus, and Eudorylaimus were always less abundant in mulch-treated plots, whereas Plectus and Belonolaimus were always more abundant. Of various indices of community composition, only maturity indices, unlike diversity indices, indicated the status and intensity of soil processes (decomposition, mineralization). However, different responses of single genera within a trophic group implied unique contributions of nematode genera in soil ecosystem processes on a temporal scale, suggesting that generic or possibly species level of resolution provide the most adequate information about the soil ecosystem.

SO BIOTECHNOLOGY PROGRESS

ID ZYMOMONAS-MOBILIS; ETHANOL
AB Bioethanol is a fuel-grade ethanol made from trees, grasses, and waste materials. It represents a sustainable substitute for gasoline in today's passenger cars. Modeling and design of processes for making bioethanol are critical tools used in the U.S. Department of Energy's bioethanol research and development program. We use such analysis to guide new directions for research and to help us understand the level at which and the time when bioethanol will achieve commercial success. This paper provides an update on our latest estimates for current and projected costs of bioethanol. These estimates are the result of very sophisticated modeling and costing efforts undertaken in the program over the past few years. Bioethanol could cost anywhere from $1.16 to $1.44 per gallon, depending on the technology and the availability of low cost feedstocks for conversion: to ethanol. While this cost range opens the door to fuel blending opportunities, in which ethanol can be used, for example, to improve the octane rating of gasoline, it is not currently competitive with gasoline as a bulk fuel. Research strategies and goals described in this paper have been translated into cost savings for ethanol. Our analysis of these goals shows that the cost of ethanol could drop by 40 cents per gallon over the next ten years by taking advantage of exciting new tools in biotechnology that will improve yield and performance in the conversion process.

AB The survival of Cryptosporidium parvum in source separated urine was investigated as part of a broader study on microbial risks associated with the reuse of human urine for sustainable agriculture. A dye permeability assay and in vitro excystation were the primary methods used to assess viability. In the collected urine most of the nitrogen is present as ammonia and the pH is generally around 9. Parallel investigations were made in buffers to compare possible toxic effects of urine to actual pH effects. Oocysts in the untreated urine were inactivated below the detection Limit (1/300) within 63 days. This inactivation rate was significantly higher (p < 0.01) than in urine adjusted to pH 5 or 7 according to the dye permeability assay. The corresponding difference between different pH values was not seen in buffers, suggesting that the antiprotozoan effect of urine was mediated by other factors besides pH. The Swedish practice of storing urine for six months before its use thus appears satisfactory for the inactivation of Cryptosporidium oocysts.

AB Potato, Solanum tuberosum, is the fourth-ranked food crop used to support a growing world population because of cultivar versatility and high complex carbohydrate content. Potatoes can be stored for long periods for table and processing markets, but are plagued by storage disease problems. Diseases both in the field and during storage can be limiting factors in sustainable and profitable potato production wherever they are grown. in North America, many diseases caused by fungi are important and require a variety of management practices to reduce them to tolerable economic levels. Such diseases include late blight [Phytophthora infestans], silver scurf [Helminthosporium solani], pink rot [Phytophthora erythroseptica], dry rot [Fusanium sambucinum], verticillium wilt [Verticillium dahliae and Verticillium albo-atrum], black scurf [Rhizoctonia solani], and early blight [Alternaria solani]. These diseases have both a field and storage component, and disease management inputs may be necessary throughout the season for disease control. A continuing combination of cultural practices, planting of resistant cultivars, clean seed, crop rotation, and fungicides (plant medicines) are necessary for disease control. This presentation highlights the basics of each disease and, based on disease epidemiology, the current strategies used for control, and strategies underway for future control, including the development of resistant cultivars.

   bush in western Niger

ID SAHEL; WOODLAND; MODEL
AB The tiger bush is a patterned woodland with alternating bare area and vegetated stripes. In Niger, it covers one third of the Sahelian zone. These natural forests are of considerable economical interest since they are the main source of livestock forage and domestic energy. Its sustainable exploitation needs improved understanding of its dynamics. The redistribution of water between thicket and intervening bare areas is decisive for the water supply of the vegetation. Tiger bush patterning replicates an elementary unit composed of a bare area, the upslope border, the core and the downslope margin of the thicker. (Each zone of tiger bush is characterised by specific soil crusting associated with vegetation). Both water storage and runoff have been monitored after each rain, over a period of 4 yr, including contrasting rainy seasons, on the different zones composing the tiger bush. On the three crusted zones, runoff has a piecewise linear relationship with rain: on closed plots, runoff yield vs. annual rainfall ratio reaches 54% on bare soil, 2% on upslope border and 18% on downslope border. The measured infiltration confirms these rates on independent plots. In the core of the thicket, measured infiltration corresponds with the sum of the contributions of upslope zones, weighted by their relative lengths. This model predicts that bare area contributes up to 62% of the thicket supply, while direct rain is 27%, the senescence zone is 10% and the upslope border contribution is negligible (1%). The average water infiltration in the thicket is equal to 4 X the incident rainfall, but water redistribution is not homogeneous within the core of the thicket. By the most favourable location, infiltration depth is measured to be about 8 X the rainfall. The important runoff, mainly generated on the impervious bare area crosses the upslope border of the thicket without infiltrating, and entirely benefit to the core. Nothing is left to the downslope border, only rainfed. The upslope border, often described as favourable location for young plants is only rainfed most part of the year. By the end of the season, its increasing porosity, due to vegetation and termite activity let it benefit of the last rains. The simple water balance model based on runoff measurement is satisfactorily validated by independent observed infiltration. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Tiger bush in Niger has been often hypothesised to act as a natural water-harvesting system. The interband:band ratio (IBR) and the related efficiency of the system in terms of water concentration and woody biomass production appeared as crucial questions to be addressed and documented. This study focused on the role of annual rainfall upon the structure and the functioning of the tiger bush system. A regional transect, totalling approximately 200 km in length was established north/south across the rainfall gradient. It included 10 local transects each spanning five interbands and bands. Along the local transects, surface features were carefully recorded as well as woody biovolume, One of these local transects was completely harvested so that biovolume could be related to biomass. Annual woodcutting was estimated after a detailed regional study. In addition to field measurements performed in 1995, the IBR was measured on sequential aerial photographs (1950, 1955, 1962, 1975, 1992), using a 16 X binocular magnifier combined with a stage micrometer with 0.1 mm division. A simple model of rainwater redistribution was designed based on surface conditions properties. The best correlation of IBR was obtained with annual rainfall averaged over the last 15 yr (Ra-15). This ratio was dramatically increased where Ra-15 declined below a threshold of approximately 350 mm. The ratio between the water shedding zone (RZ) and the infiltration zone (IZ), RZ:IZ, based on field crust type survey, was a better predictor for the water-harvesting efficiency of the system than was LBR. The water harvesting model could be used as a satisfactory predictor for woody biomass (R-2 = 0.83). Best simulations were obtained when wood cutting during the last 8 yr was accounted for. The water harvesting and concentration enables wood production which equals that of the forest in much more humid southern zones. The thicket production in the banded patterned systems succeeds in over-compensating the barrenness of the interbands, even exceeding woody biomass of industrial plantations in the same region. Due to the gradual thickening of the infiltration zone, the water-harvesting system becomes no longer effective at the wetter southern end of the tiger bush domain (Ra-15 = 685 mm). Conversely, the decreasing favourable conditions to infiltration should lead to a dry limit of (Ra-15 = 155 mm). Therefore, woody biomass production of the tiger bush is controlled by two opposing trends linked to mean rainfall. The result is that the production of these structures reaches a maximum at 550 mm mean annual rainfall. The sustainable use of tiger bush in the longer term requires the careful maintenance of this natural water harvesting system, with no attempts of afforestation in the interbands, no agriculture, and only moderate wood harvesting in the vegetation bands. Rehabilitation strategies which mimic the natural tiger bush ecosystem are the most appropriate under these climatic circumstances. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The commercial fishery of the red sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus franciscanus, an important resource in Baja California, is showing signs of overexploitation. The yield per recruit and the Beverton and Holt optimization dynamic models were used to find the size at first capture that allows maximum profits and keeps the resource at a sustainable level for future generations. The biological parameters used were L-infinity = 155 mm, K = 0.22 and M = 0.22. The yield per recruit model suggests that to maximize yield it is necessary to increase the size of first capture to 105 mm with fishing mortality close to 0.65. The results of the dynamic optimization model indicated that the size of optimum catch and cohort biomass decrease as the discount rate increases, and this is reflected in a reduction of the yields, For discount rates lower than 5%, which is recommended for this fishery, the size of optimum catch is located between 110 and 116 mm. Both models suggest that the minimum legal size established by the Ministry of Natural Resources. Environment and Fishing (SEMARNAP) of 80 min for the red sea urchin is below the size that allows obtaining optimal gains. In order to obtain large catches in the long term and to maximize the economical profits it is necessary to increase the size of first capture to 110 mm. For the discount rate of 0% a time interval was calculated in which fishing takes place with a maximum rate. The results indicate that the fishing season can be reduced from eight to four months.

DE Canadian network for sustainable mining; sustainable development;
   ecosystems; mining technology; whitehorse mining initiative
AB The mineral industry has seen many significant changes in the past decade. increasingly it has responded to unanticipated pressures and demands with a variety of voluntary initiatives. Yet there is still much to do. Mining now lakes place in a different context than was the case in the past. Socio-economic, political and environmental considerations must now be integrated into traditional mining systems. This process of integration needs to involve industry, governments, academics, communities and other stakeholders to design a new approach to mining, one that can be fostered through interdisciplinary links and holistic strategies. This paper considers the meaning of sustainability in the context of the Canadian mining industry and explores the need for a broader vision for the mining industry The role of technology is then analyzed and related to an initiative recently taken by Canadian universities to develop a national network for interdisciplinary research into sustainable mining, CaSM.

TI Transition to a market economy and sustained growth. Implications for
   the post-Washington consensus
SO COMMUNIST AND POST-COMMUNIST STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
AB Transition to a market economy is a lengthy process comprised of various spheres of economic activities. The belief that a market economy can be introduced by "shock therapy" is wrong, and in several cases has caused more problems than it has solved. Since a market economy requires adequate institutional structures, transition can be executed only in a gradual manner. Despite the fact that so-called Washington consensus, i.e. a set of policies aiming to shift from stabilization to growth, was developed without concern for post-socialist transformation, these ideas have significantly influenced the path of thought and action in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. After a decade of transition and lasting depression, a new, post-Washington consensus is developing. Major policy conclusions suggest that the core of emerging consensus, also based on the lessons from transitions, is institutional building. Only with strong institutions can liberalization and privatization put emerging post-socialist markets on the path of sustainable growth. Yet, to accomplish such a task the policy reforms must also take into consideration the need for equitable growth and the new role of the state. The latter must not retire from economic activities, but ought to change its role to support the reforms and integration of the post-socialist countries into the world economy in the era of globalization, of which the post-communist transition is an important part.

AB Objective The aim of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a sugar-free medicines campaign using suitable prescribing and purchasing indicators. Basic research design Quantitative analysis of sugar-free medicine use, before (1995) and after (1996) the campaign. Clinical setting Two test and two control districts in north east England. Participants General medical practitioners (GPs) and community pharmacists. Intervention A 12-month campaign involving development and distribution of information packs designed to increase the proportion of prescriptions dispensed sugar-free for paediatric use. Main outcome measures Changes in the proportion of the following which were sugar-free: (a) for target prescribed medicines (i) number of prescriptions dispensed. (ii) number of prescribed daily amounts (PDA); (b) for target over the counter (OTC) medicines, (i) number of bottles sold, (ii) number of standard daily amounts (SDA) sold. Results Quantitative analysis of prescriptions and OTC sales showed statistically highly significant changes towards sugar-free prescribing and dispensing of prescribed medicines but only small increases in the proportion of some sugar-free OTC sales. Conclusions The impact of the campaign was shown to be greatest in changing prescribing habits of GPs with less effect on OTC medicine use. The outcome measures used were suitable for quantitative evaluation of the campaign. Post-campaign development Sustainable changes in GPs' prescribing behaviour can be facilitated by software suppliers' modifications to computing software used for prescription writing.

AB Realizing what is actually discussed as Sustainable Development, among others leads to the need of dematerializing our industrial economy. Here, one approach is to set up cyclical systems, connecting production, logistic and recycling processes in an environmentally-sound manner.
   This paper shows some of the latest results of the Fraunhofer IML's applied-research activities in this field with special regard to reverse logistics, disassembly and recycling. Thus, it gives an idea of some of the important aspects currently under discussion in the industry when setting up economically viable end-of-life solutions.
   Starting with a short overview on the legal situation and the responsibility of the producers for end-of-life products, this paper comes up with a new approach, for sq systematically analyzing and modeling end-of-life networks. The last part discusses some real-life recycling networks using the Deutsche Telekom and AGR/Electrocycling, one of the biggest recyclers for electrical and electronic equipment in Germany, as well as the recycling of refrigerators as examples and shows ways of improving the existing and new systems from both an ecological and economical point of view.

AB This article takes a critical look at the various approaches representing local knowledge as a scapegoat for underdevelopment or as a panacea for sustainability, these two representations characterizing the conventional environment-development discourse. The static oppositions of local versus universal knowledge are challenged by establishing more diversified models to analyse the relationships of heterogeneous knowledges. The study emphasizes the complex articulation of knowledge repertoires by drawing on an ethnographic case study among migrant peasants in southeastern Nicaragua. Knowledge production is seen as a process of social negotiation involving multiple actors and complex power relations. The article underlines the issue of situated knowledges as one of the major challenges in developing anthropology as an approach that subjects fixed dichotomies between subject and object, fact and value, and the rational and the practical, to critical reconstruction.

AB Despite the urgency of the ecological crisis the steady continuation of environmental degradation suggests that new ways of interpreting problems and acting with environmental integrity may need to be considered. This paper draws on a broad range of contemporary theory to argue that the conventional conceptualization of environmental problems has remained a largely disciplinary-based exercise that has relied on abstracting the environmental issues from their real-world complexity. A practical articulation of the main environmental narratives reveals self-referential discourses whose disciplinary-based practices have insulated these approaches from a broad range of contemporary theorising and different ways of knowing. The dominance of these approaches in environmental policy development has led to the continued acceleration of environmental degradation despite widespread political and social interest in its abatement. This paper provides a critique of methodologies derived from the assumptions of instrumental rationalism, and contemplates the potential for alternative 'communicative' approaches and strategies for dealing with environmental policy development and implementation. It is argued that a communicative approach to planning for sustainability represents a more appropriate strategy for mobilising a currently impotent environmental movement. A communicative approach by explicitly dealing with the assumptions and motivations of contested positions in the sustainability debate, it is argued, offers the most pragmatic way of developing change strategies to deal with the complex issues surrounding environmental policy development and implementation.

AB Travel patterns among different socio-economic groups in Sweden are investigated. It is shown that elderly persons, persons with low incomes and women in general do not travel extensively. Middle-aged persons, persons with high incomes and men travel much farther. Cars are the dominant transportation mode for all population groups. Aeroplanes are used mostly by high-income earners and men, while public transportation is mostly used by young people and women. Energy consumption for the different travel patterns differs substantially. Men with high incomes consume the most energy, with 94 000 MJ during one year, while elderly women consume 12 000 MJ. When compared to a calculated sustainable level of energy consumption for travel, most population groups are in excess. The level for sustainable energy consumption is calculated based on an assumed global potential for renewable energy of 360 EJ per year, divided equally among the global population. A certain share of this energy potential is supposed to be used for travelling. A scenario for 2020 is presented in which vehicle energy efficiency has increased and travel patterns have changed from what they are today. Sustainability can only be reached when both travel patterns and vehicle technology have changed radically. Differences in energy consumption for travel due to age and gender are likely to remain in the future. Scientific knowledge from the social domains seems to be important for devising efficient strategies for a sustainable society. Current focus on policy measures has been mainly on technical issues.

ID ENVIRONMENT
AB Natural capital contributes to the quality of life of a region in two complementary ways: first, by directly providing environmental services that cannot be imported, and second, by supplying the natural resources that, through a human controlled production process, become valuable to humans. The evolution of the combination of these two components of the quality of life determines the path of development a region takes. Environmental services also determine the ability of natural capital to regenerate itself Ecosystems and other components of the regional natural capital produce environmental services that provide life-support functions necessary for natural capital reproduction. The destruction of this critical natural capital impairs the internal sources of improvement of the quality of life of a region, leading to a non-sustainable path of development. This article describes a model of the relationship between natural capital and quality of life that provides a stricter definition of sustainable development through explicit characterization and classification of natural capital according to its ability to produce life-supporting environmental services, by its substitutability, and by its possible reconstruction. Application of this model then shows that there are 51 possible regional development paths, only 32 of which are sustainable and only 14 of which are sustainable while also providing improvements in quality of life. Only six of these 14 sustainable development paths are attained with economic growth, however, while the other eight paths increase quality of life by increasing the production of environmental services. The model could help in the development of institutional interventions that would promote regional development paths that are sustainable. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB To analyze the contribution of epidemiological surveillance to the sustainability of public health interventions, programs designed to suppress prevalence of vector-borne infections are contrasted with those aiming to contain outbreaks of such agents of disease. Suppression programs apply insecticides or drugs according to a predetermined plan, employing surveillance solely for evaluating progress. Containment programs, in contrast, react to epidemiological indicators. Although efforts to suppress prevalence should be time-limited, reactive programs may be indefinitely sustainable. Alternative epidemiological bases for surveillance are described, including indicators for the basic reproduction number of infections, vectorial capacity, reservoir capacity, entomological inoculation rates (EIR), and transmission indices (TI) based on experience. Although risk of human infection is most reliably estimated as a function of the EIR, interventions are most frequently guided by TI estimates. Because they invest in surveillance rather than application of insecticides or drugs, containment efforts are more sustainable and more conducive to ecosystem health than are programs designed to suppress transmission.

TI Modelling change in state of complex ecological systems in space and
   time: An application to sustainable grazing management
SO ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
LA English
DT Article
ID ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE; RANGELANDS
AB Meeting the challenge of sustainable development requires substantial advances in understanding of the interaction of natural and human systems. The emerging ecosystem management paradigm of multiple stable states, non-linear systems behaviour, discontinuous change, self-organisation and multiple development pathways has major implications for when and how change in complex systems occurs and how it can be managed. It also poses considerable challenges for modelling the structure and function of natural and human management systems, including fundamental constraints relating to: scaling mismatches, synthesis of non-homogeneous information, multiscaled system interactions, complex management systems, uncertainty in causal relationships, assessment of trade-offs, and validation. This paper examines how a decision support system (DSS) for sustainable grazing management, called Landassess DSS, attempts to deal with some of these issues through an integrated systems approach to DSS development. This approach utilises object-oriented techniques, knowledge-based systems, geographical information systems (GIS), and a state-and-transition model framework to model the critical change processes. It provides for the identification of the major driving factors and constraints to change in complex resource management systems, as well as the assessment of the likely trade-offs between resource sustainability and economic production at a scale relevant to management decision-making (i.e., paddock or property).

TI The South Australian lobster fishery management model
SO ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
LA English
DT Article
ID TASMANIAN ROCK LOBSTER; JASUS-EDWARDSII
AB Modelling the rock lobster (Jasus edwardsii) fishery in South Australia was the focus of a three-year data gathering program. In collaboration with fishers, a tool for assisting in the sustainable management of the resource was developed. The goal was to test management policies to allow increases in reproductive output while enhancing economic yield. The model's user interface was developed to an ease of use comparable to commercial software for use by fishers in comanagement of the resource. This paper describes the modelling framework, user interface, and results for management strategies under consideration. The framework is comprised of five principle submodels: catch, effort, growth, economics, and population reproduction, with the lobster population divided into 8 mm length classes by sex and spatial cell. The mortality of lobsters occurs by commercial harvest, natural mortality, incidental release mortality, predation inside pots before retrieval, illegal harvesting, and recreational catch. Five categories of management control scenario were simulated: catch quota, effort regulation (as total pot retrievals), size regulations (allowing minimum, maximum, and mid-range slice length protection), and seasonal and area closures. Model outputs imply that size strategies have limited potential compared with effort limitations and quota. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Over the years, estimates have been made of the portions of human mortality and morbidity that can be attributed to environmental factors. Frustratingly, however, even for a single category of disease such as cancer, these estimates have often varied widely. Here we attempt to explain why such efforts have come to such different results in the past and to provide guidance for doing such estimates more consistently in the future to avoid the most important pitfalls. We do so by carefully defining what we mean by the terms "environmental," "ill health," and "attributable." Finally, based on these recommendations, we attempt our own estimate, appropriately qualified according to the many remaining uncertainties. Our estimate is that 25-33% of the global burden of disease can be attributed to environmental risk factors, Children under 5 years of age seem to bear the largest environmental burden, and the portion of disease due to environmental risks seems to decrease with economic development. A summary of these estimates first appeared in the 1997 report, "Health and Environment in Sustainable Development," which was the World Health Organization's contribution to the 5-year anniversary of the Rio Earth Summit. A full explanation of how these estimates were made is first presented here. We end with a call for a program of "strategic epidemiology," which would be designed to fill important gaps in the understanding of major environmental health risks in important population groups worldwide.

AB This paper discusses the links among health, environment, and sustainable development and presents a framework that extends from the epidemiological domain to the policy domain and includes the driving forces that generate environmental pressures, creating changes in the state of the environment and eventually contributing to human exposures. Health effects are the end result of this complex net of events. Environmental health interventions should not be limited to treatment of cases and directly reducing human exposures. The paper discusses the need for integrated action at all levels and, in particular, on the need to focus on long-term action directed at reducing the driving forces that generate the environmental health threats. Only this approach can achieve sustained health benefits and environmental protection in accord with the principles of sustainable development.

ID AMAZONIA; DATES; COAST
AB Until very recently, papers dealing with Quaternary geology were very scarce in the Brazilian geoscientific literature. In spite of its multidisciplinary nature, the only existing publications on this subject were I-elated to geotechnical and/or geomorphical characteristics. In the last 30 years, this picture changed due to several international programs such as the IGCP projects and agreements between ORSTOM (France) and CNPq (Brazil). They have started with studies of relative sea-level changes along northeastern, central, and southeastern coasts, conducted together with 700 radiocarbon dates. These researches have been followed by paleoclimatic studies, mostly done by palynological and stable carbon isotopes analyses, mainly in Amazon, central-western and southern areas. Finally, several neotectonic studies are in progress, especially in Amazon and southeastern regions. Those studies resulted in a better knowledge about the Quaternary evolutionary history of Brazil, mostly during the Late Pleistocene and Holocene. More of those studies have to be developed in order to adequately subsidize the sustainable development of this country.

ID STABILITY
AB In both Canada and the United States, there has been a growing interest in the sustainability of forests and forest communities. policy makers and scientists have attempted to understand how forest management practices can enhance or harm the future of such communities. Although many studies have historically used economic indicators as measures of community stability, more recently researchers have demonstrated that the relationship between communities and forests goes far beyond simple economic dependency. Thus, recent frameworks for assessing forest communities have also addressed the need for broader social and institutional components. In this article, we briefly review three of these recent concepts - community capacity, community well-being and community resiliency - and examine what each of these terms has to contribute to the assessment of forest communities.

DE social sustainability; forestry communities; transition
AB Changes in land use and forestry practices in coastal British Columbia have resulted in a period of "transition" for forestry communities. Here I examine proposals by environmental non-governmental organizations and transition strategies developed by government to maintain the social sustainability of forestry communities during economic transition. This examination reveals that the primary focus of transition is a concern for jobs, primarily jobs of "displaced forestry workers." I argue that this focus on jobs is unnecessarily narrow and is insufficient in promoting the social sustainability of these places.

DE sense of place; social indicators; community wellbeing
AB "Sense of place," or the meaning and attachments that community residents have towards their community, is a potentially useful and somewhat neglected indicator of sustainability. Issues of human community need to be addressed in forest management. Recent considerations of forests as complex ecological systems to be sustained have tended to neglect human concerns. These include, but are not limited to, economic well-being: other "subjective" indicators of quality of life are also relevant, and comprehensible via conventional scientific inquiry. Sense of place is one such indicator - although quantitative research on sense of place is in its infancy, it is readily understood through conventional social psychological measures, which have the advantage of being monitored over time or compared across settings.

AB This paper provides an overview of three approaches to forest management being applied by First Nations in Canada: industrial forestry, forest co-management and community forests. Industrial forestry, involving large-scale harvesting of timber, has been successful in increasing employment levels for some First Nations. However, industrial forestry is difficult to pursue due to the significant financial and timber resources it requires, and it may result in social conflicts between timber harvesters and traditional users of the forest. Forest co-management refers to shared management of forest resources by First Nations, government and/or industry. Benefits of co-management for First Nations can include better decision-making, increased employment opportunities, and cultural sensitivity toward First Nation forestry concerns. Disadvantages can include inequality of the partners in co-management arrangements and lack of public involvement in decision-making. Community forests often include local control, local investment of profits, and greater attention to the long term returns from the forest. The community forest approach may be hindered by a lack of profit, an absence of alternative tenure arrangements and other models to follow, and difficult access to financial resources and adequate land bases. The current state of institutional reform offers hope for the incorporation of Aboriginal objectives in sustainable forest management. New institutions can contribute to sustainability in forest-dependent Aboriginal communities by increasing commitment to and support of local forest management practices.

AB To increase local diversity, and to enhance prospects of sustainability, two very distinct challenges must be addressed. First, attention must be given to local capacity building so that people and places can react to the challenges and opportunities encapsulated within processes of "change" or "adjustment." Second, there must be a wider participation in the sustainable development process and debate - after all, we cannot call it "community development" if the broader community does not participate. This paper provides an illustration of how one community group in small town British Columbia is working to address both the capacity building and participation challenges.

AB Social, political and economic conditions are changing in rural Canada. The forest industry has operated in rural communities throughout the nation for several centuries and the relationships between forest companies and communities have evolved over that time. This paper outlines a model for company-community relations that will foster sustainable communities given the new realities that exist in rural Canada. The model will benefit forest industry firms as well as the communities that host them. Six problems that inhibit sustainability in timber-dependent communities are outlined and several ideas for corporate action to address these challenges are offered. Among these are supporting human capital development, leadership development, and entrepreneurship; nurturing healthy communities; and ensuring that costs and benefits associated with timber-dependence are distributed evenly across regions where specific companies have a sphere of influence and within specific communities where companies operate.

AB Forest certification programs establish standards for sustainable forest management (SFM), and processes for evaluating the practices of companies relative to those standards. FORESTCARE is a volunteer, provincial-level certification program initiated by the Alberta Forest Products Association, its members, and stake-holders. Using a participating woodlands operation in northern Alberta as a test case, we examined how SFM criteria are applied in the FORESTCARE program, and whether measurable progress is evident. We also compared the FORESTCARE audit process with corporate and government audits performed in the same year. The test case revealed specific, measurable changes in management that represent actual or potential progress toward SFM. However, the improvements could not be directly attributed to the FORESTCARE Program. Recommendations are provided for strengthening FORESTCARE processes and practices.

ID STABLE STATES
AB The dynamics of ecosystems and human systems need to be addressed in the context of post-normal. science grounded in complex systems thinking. We portray these systems as Self-Organizing Holarchic Open (SOHO) systems and interpret their behaviours and structures with reference to non-equilibrium thermodynamics: holons, propensities and canons; and information and attractors. Given the phenomena exhibited by SOHO systems, conventional science approaches to modelling and forecasting are inappropriate, as are prevailing explanations in terms of linear causality and stochastic properties. Instead, narratives in the form of scenarios to depict morphogenetic causal loops, autocatalysis, and multiple possible pathways for development need to be considered. Short examples are given. We also link SOHO system descriptions to issues of human preferences and choices concerning the preferred attributes of particular SOHO systems, and to the implications for achieving them through adaptive management, monitoring and appropriate structures for governance. A heuristic framework to guide reasoning for this is presented, and reiterative steps for applying it are identified. In this way we provide a coherent conceptual basis, in the workings of both natural systems and decision systems, for the practice of post-normal science. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB The land use system of the De Marke experimental farm for sustainable dairy farming was standardized to allow extrapolation to other sandy soils by means of a simulation study. This standardization is a description of the land use system as a set of decision rules. Three parcel types are distinguished on the farm: permanent pastures and two different rotations with grass and silage maize. Land use of these three parcel types was thus described with decision rules for fertilization, grazing and cutting of grassland and supplementary irrigation. The effect of temporal variability due to weather conditions was taken into account by using a set of weather data over a period of 30 years for the simulations. The decision rules were applied to the actual fields and soils of De Marke for these 30 years as well as to five representative soils for major soil mapping units of the sandy areas of the 1:50 000 Soil Map of the Netherlands in order to explore the possible effects of introducing this land use at farms in other areas with sandy soils. The profile descriptions of the representative soils were formed from all available soil survey information for the mapping units. The average simulated nitrate-N concentration at a depth of 1 m for the De Marke farm as a whole was 15.1 mg l(-1) and the probability of exceeding the EC-directive for drinking water (11.3 mg l(-1)) at the same depth was 67%. The probabilities of exceeding this value ranged from 3 to 73% for the five major mapping units. The average actual transpiration of the land use system was higher than at De Marke for all five soil map units, which implies a potential for higher crop yields. This means that it would be easier to meet both the environmental and agricultural goals of De Marke on most other sandy soils than those of De Marke itself. The three parcel types resulted in different levels of nitrate leaching, and it would therefore be worthwhile locating permanent pastures, which are used most intensively, on soils which show the least environmental risk, and vice versa.

AB Provision of municipal services by local authorities alone cannot be sustained in most cities of the developing countries. Until early 1990s the Dar-es-Salaam City Authority collected less than 5% of the total refuse generated in the city per day. Limited public-sector resources accounted for such low performance. The Sustainable Dar-es-Salaam Project, through environmental planning and management, has been promoting participatory and partnership arrangements whereby working groups formulate strategies and prepare action plans to address critical environmental issues. As an output of the working groups, innovative ways of improving solid waste management in the city have included emergency cleanup campaigns, privatization, community involvement, disposal site management and waste recycling. We have been able to evaluate the performance of these innovative ways through participant observation, document reviews, official interviews, and a survey of householders and businesses. We conclude that these approaches have proved more effective in enhancing solid waste management in Dar-es-Salaam than the conventional approaches. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The Pearl River Delta is developing very rapidly in the last two decades since the adoption of economic reform and open-door policy of China in 1978, Concomitant to this development is the rapid change of landscape in both urban and rural areas. The loss of valuable agricultural land by the encroachment of urban development, especially massive construction sites from land speculation, is very severe recently. This paper examines the relationship between economic development and agricultural land loss in the Pearl River Delta, using Dongguan as a case study. It is found that agricultural land loss has been much aggravated by land speculation as a result of the property bloom in the Pearl River Delta that was induced by the property boom in Hong Kong in the early 1990s. The urban sprawl in the Pearl River Delta is also related to other economic factors, such as rural industrialization, rise of localism, influence from Hong Kong, transport improvement, and lack of land management and monitoring system. There is an urgent need to develop a sustainable land development strategy to protect the fertile agricultural land from further unnecessary losses, especially from land speculation.

DE political ecology; antienvironmentalism; Calakmul Biosphere Reserve;
   seasonal tropical ecology; community-based conservation
AB Theory in political ecology emphasizes the role of competing interests in shaping resource use. Although supportive of these approaches, this article draws on the importance of meanings assigned to ecological systems to question how epistemological differences also contribute to environmental conflicts. Following calls to examine the interface between environmental knowledge and action, consideration is given to ethnoecological constructs of forests on Mexico's southern Yucatan peninsula, home to the Calakmul Biosphere Reserve. To quiet opposition to the Reserve, government agents increased financial aid to the region in the form of conservation development projects. With the counsel of a Reserve director, local residents effectively used these projects to press for an environmentalism based on sustainable resource use. This position has associations with a local ethnoecology of land as a place of work. In examining how ethnoecologies played out in contests surrounding conservation, possibilities for a localized, alternative environmentalism are discussed, as well as the importance of environmental constructs for research in political ecology.

TI Environmental change and pastoral perceptions: Degradation and
   indigenous knowledge in two African pastoral communities
SO HUMAN ECOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE African pastoralists; indigenous knowledge; environmental degradation
AB Mobile livestock herders have long been seen as the main culprits of overstocking and rangeland degradation. In recent years, however anthropologists and ecologists have argued that African pastoralists have developed sustainable modes of pasture management based on a sound knowledge of savanna ecosystems. Comparing indigenous knowledge on species' grazing values, plant succession, and ideas about the causes for environmental change in two African pastoral societies (the Kenyan Pokot and the Namibian Himba), it is shown that their knowledge is indeed fine-grained and complex but at the same time socially constructed and embedded in ideology. It relates to a cultural landscape and not to abstract considerations on climax vegetation and its changes over time, Pastoral knowledge is built up around the interaction between herds and vegetation rather than around the environment as such.

DE gender; sustainable agriculture; soil degradation; Honduras; policy
AB In Honduras, the economic and social effects of natural resource decline, poverty, and population pressure, all exacerbated now in the aftermath of Hurricane Mitch, are directly experienced at the household level. Recent research and policy work on gender and environment raise a number of interesting questions on how and why household labor responses to natural resource decline may be gender differentiated. This article presents results on the gender-disaggregated response to natural resource degradation. Specifically, we investigate whether women's and men's time allocated to corn production responds to changes in soil quality. We also address the issue of whether the gender division of labor is modified as households respond to soil degradation.

DT Article
AB The IBM S/390(R) fifth-generation CMOS-based server (more commonly known as the G5) produced a dramatic improvement in system-level performance in comparison with its predecessor, the G4, Much of this improvement can be attributed to an innovative approach to the cache and memory hierarchy: the binodal cache architecture. This design features shared caching and very high sustainable bandwidths at all points in the system. It contains several innovations in managing shared data, in maintaining high bandwidths at critical points in the system, and in sustaining high performance with unparalleled fault tolerance and recovery capabilities, This paper addresses several of these key features as they are implemented in the S/390 G5 server and its successor, the S/390 G6 server.

AB This paper discusses new realities in Power Development in Developing Countries as seen by the United Nations, The World Energy Council, Asia, Latin America, and Africa.
   At the outset, technical assistance given by the United Nations for global sustainability projects is summarised. Power system expansion and interconnection in China, greenhouse gas emission reduction in Egypt, and integrated development of the Arab-Mediterranean Region and environmental considerations are among the projects that are highlighted. The pressing need of Developing Countries as seen by the World Energy Council to meet energy needs without prejudice to the environment where technological advances in the production, delivery and utilization of electrical energy are central to resolving conflicts between energy and the environment is then discussed.
   The paper goes on to discuss power system planning in deregulated environments where the Brazilian experience is highlighted, Global dynamics and potential for an integrated African Grid is then examined. Concepts associated with the growing interest in renewable resources in Central and East Africa for domestic, continental and international utilization are synthesized. Current and future energy development proposals are discussed with emphasis on operational reliability as a basis for potential large system design. Given are generalised representation to illustrate hydroelectric potential of the Central and East African regions and the kind of centralised pool that could be developed as a results. Other studies which include the Africa-Europe and Zaire-Egypt initiatives are also discussed.

AB The behavior of a meniscus in a slider-disk interface is analyzed in three cases. In a quasi-steady state, normal force due to the meniscus pressure and surface tension are compared. Bimodal distribution of the fly/stiction is explained by the availability of a wick. In the absence of slider-disk movement, the tendency of meniscus growth is studied. A constant volume is sustainable only in a concave gap. In the onset of slider-disk motion, the change in stiction is analyzed. A meniscus is more resilient against a steady force than against a short pulse.

AB A field study was conducted for 3 consecutive years (1995-98) to determine the effect of: different micro-nutrients with and without farmyard manure on yield and yield attributes of soybean [Glycine maw (L.) Merr.]. The results showed that the application of farmyard manure @ 10 tonnes/ha alone is sufficent to compensate the requirements of different micro-nutrients (Zn, B, and Mo) rather than going for individual applications of micro-nutrients or along with farmyard manure. The treatment was adjudged stable and sustainale for production of soybean. The application of micro-nutrients with farmyard manure were relatively gave more stable yield performance than the treatment without farmyard maure.

AB A field experiment was conducted at Jamalpur, Bangladesh, on alluvial sons during winter seasons of 1995-98 to evaluate the economically and biologically sustainable intercrop association of wheat [Triticum aestivum (L.) emend. Fiori & Paol.], with yellow sarson (Brassica campestris L.) and local grasspea (Lathyrus sativus L.), grown for fodder and grain under rainfed condition. Intercropping of grasspea either for grain or fodder and yellow sarson with wheat was found biologically sustainable over sole wheat. Between the intercrop the association of wheat with grasspea was more beneficial than mustard. Association of wheat with grasspea (G) under either 3:1 or 1:1 and grasspea (F) under 3:1 row ratio was found more sustainable as, these were accounted for better value in respect of biological parameters and were economically more remunerative. Three crop combination in alternate rows (1:1:1) failed to overcome double crops but more feasible agronomically over sole stand.

SO INTERCIENCIA

ID PRODUCTIVITY; STATE; ECOSYSTEMS; VEGETATION
AB The wide variety of landforms, as well as climatic, and edaphic diversity have given rise to an heterogeneous landscape configuration, formed by finely fragmented habitats. This situation is enhanced by a long history of human occupation, specially on plain and undulating terrain. The environmental heterogeneity becomes apparent in the vegetation, which consists of an intricate aggregation of physiognomic types, representing stales and transitions triggered by human intervention An 18% of Falcon State is occupied by desert vegetation, 25% by open, woodlands, and only 29% of the terrain is covered by closed vegetation types. The remaining 28% comprises the converted lands, mostly pasturelands, where desertification is in process. The main activity is extensile goat herding in the driest portions and cattle raising in the subhumid zones. Fine timber harvesting and column-cacti handcrafted furniture compete with goal raising for the native pasture. The latter is the main economic activity in Falcon Slate, first national producer of goals meat and milk.
   Extreme, or low probability events ale common in these highly diversified landscapes. The occurrence of various vegetation types in such varied edaphic and climatic situations as well as the uniform tendency towards deterioration through indiscriminated grazing (overexploitation or replacement of the native flora by undesirable species), calls for intelligent information gathering on landuse and evolution within the various environmental situations in the world. This should be a priority if global natural biodiversity is to be protected.
   The thorough interpretation of biodiversity changes occurring at species, plant physiognomy and spatial levels, during the varied and shifting landuse patterns in an area with such a long history of human occupation, should guide in the understanding of ecosystem functioning and in the selection of sustainable management approaches.
   With this frame of references in mind, we report on a vast (11.632 km(2)), diverse (41 physiognomic types) and rich (974 species) set of ecosystems in the dry lands of Falcon State. We analyze the relationships between vegetation structure, physiognomy and biodiversity, as well as the consequences of human activity on these plant variables. This eco-evolutionary basis is expected to become a framework for a set of experiments which, if properly planned, should allow an intelligent and harmonious intervention in a short rime, not only to increase productivity but to enhance the ecosystem's dynamic stability.
   It is stated that biodiversity increases as structure becomes more complex, however, in Falcon species diversity of the primary structural groups shows two contrasting tendencies depending on available environmental humidity, as assessed by the Bailey's moisture index. Another usual statement is that productivity increases with increasing biodiversity; however, in the arid lands of Falcon the maximum biodiversity is achieved in conditions of high species richness and low total plant cover.
   The relationship between the Shannon index (H) and the Beard's system of formation series shows a tendency cowards an increase in H with a decrease in seasonal gradient; the lower the water str ess and the higher the structural complexity, the higher the biodiversity. In the edaphic plant formations, H is higher in and lower in the riparian forests dominated by a single plant cover is very high, and evenness and richness are very low. In the dry evergreen series, represented in Falcon by only one formation, biodiversity is intermediate.
   The tendency towards an increase in richness and H with the increase in humidity in the range from semiarid to subhumid, is apparent in all the communities regardless of tree layer density, tree species, where high, and evenness The desertic forests show lower H and richness than the closed forests within the arid end; but the relationship is reversed in the subhumid end of the humidity gradient.
   This results show that it is not possible to establish generalized assertions regarding the behaviour of biodiversity and richness, since these depend on the particular environmental situations, and on the variable used to quantify biodiversity (H or richness). Biodiversity is an heuristic tool for an approximation, from a little exploited angle, to the study of the record of strategies developed in the natural environment by the energy transducers that keep organized our Planet Earth.

AB Is the quest for sustainable use of the planet utopian and unworldly, or an act of enlightened self-interest? Few would label the attempts to increase human longevity unworldly, yet what significance will it have in an unsustainable world? Achieving sustainability will require entire societies to emulate attributes that humans profess to admire in others. Among the dictionary definitions of unworldly are: not seeking material advantage, and spiritually minded. Since our global life-support system is vulnerable to irresponsible individual and societal practices, the consequences of unethical behaviour and lack of compassion might well be catastrophic for human society. This paper consists of a preliminary exploration of some of these issues.

AB This paper is an evaluation of a step-by-step model which uses bioindicators as parameters of farmers' exposure to agrochemicals contained in insecticides and pesticides during their use in agriculture. It is based on an interdisciplinary proposal which, ultimately, aims to subsidize sustainability-seeking production systems. The study area was Rural Settlement I in Sumare, Sao Paulo, Brazil, composed of 26 farming families, which basically produce vegetables, chiefly tomato crops. The model was applied in four consecutive phases: (i) the diagnosis of the health situation of the inhabitants of the area; (ii) their methods of handling agrochemicals and the most commonly used active ingredients; (iii) evaluation of clinical parameters as bioindicators; and (iv) group discussion with the farmers and members of their families about the development actions in the study area. The model adopted seems to be promising for early health evaluation of the family segment of the agricultural population, not implying excessive costs, and resulted in a significant change in the collective awareness of the community.

AB Institutional development is the basis for evolving decentralized management and decision-making mechanisms at all levels of society. However, this evolution at the grassroots rarely follows a defined path. While the factors that propel evolution and development of grassroots institutions to meet specific goals have been identified, the precise manner in which each of these factors interacts and influences behaviour of individuals constituting institutions needs greater examination. The current study, which closely examines the evolutionary path of 15 institutions - Hill Resource Management Societies (HRMS) - under the Joint Forest Management Programme (JFM) in Haryana, adds to the existing knowledge on institutional development. The factors contributing to sustainability of JFM institutions to enable sustainable resource use and conservation have been analyzed and are presented in this study.

AB Based on the frequent floods over the Yangtze River valley, the thesis draws an important conclusion that China needs a disaster-avoiding economy. The theoretical points include the defining of the connotation, the basic characteristics, and the structural components of a disaster-avoiding economy, Several dialectical relations in it are also described. On the basis of scientific definition, the author poses strategically the macroscopic measures of establishing a disaster-avoiding economic system and realizing sustainable development.

TI Priorities for sustainable mountain development in Europe
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND WORLD ECOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE Europe; mountains; sustainable development; sustainable mountain
   development
AB The concept of sustainable mountain development (SMD) was first used in Chapter 13 of Agenda 21. This chapter marked the first time that mountains were recognised as a global priority, and led to a number of meetings on the topic of SMD, each of which produced a long list of priorities. The definition of SMD, and identification of indicators to evaluate success in achieving its objectives, are discussed. In order to move towards prioritisation of the concept in Europe, a questionnaire was sent to 249 respondents in 30 European countries asking for their perceptions of the importance of 36 variables linked to SMD, and of the performance of policies relating to each of these variables. The response rate was 47%. The results were analysed using importance-performance analysis, first for all respondents, and then comparing (1) respondents in Western vs. Central/Eastern Europe and (2) government vs. research/NGO respondents. The analyses show that environmental variables are generally perceived as more important than socio-political or economic variables, and that there are important differences both between different parts of Europe and between types of respondent. Such findings must be considered when defining policies for SMD at European and national scales.

TI The evolving sedentary lifestyle among nomadic pastoralists in the humid
   zone of Nigeria: implications for land-use policy
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND WORLD ECOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE Nigeria; pastoralism; nomads; sedentarisation
AB The humid zone of Nigeria has traditionally been considered unsuitable for extensive cattle production because of the prevalence of tsetse fly. Over the years, nomadic pastoralists, mainly Fulani, from the northern part of the country paid seasonal visits to this zone in search of pasture and water for their cattle during the dry season when the threat of the tsetse menace is less. The recent increase in the number of settled pastoralists has been associated with changing trends in the ecology and economy of the zone.
   Relying on recent survey data, this paper attempts a systematic analysis of the adaptive strategies of the Fulani in pursuit of a sedentary lifestyle in the humid frontier of southwest Nigeria. Some of the adaptive strategies identified include: establishment of grazing orbits within a 20 km radius of their settlements, adjustment of herd size and structure, adoption of a multiple livelihood system, production of arable crops and appropriation of traditional social structures and kinship networks for herd management.
   Long-term insecure land-holding arrangements, incessant seasonal bush burning for regeneration of pasture by the Fulani and the gradual destruction of the native forest cover are some of the problems arising from the sedentarisation of livestock production in the area. It was observed that the present land-use arrangement, even though it appears to guarantee the pastoralists security of tenure in the shore term, is not sustainable in the long run, given the increasing commercialisation of land in the: area and rapid population growth, It was, therefore, concluded that government should put in place a land redistribution arrangement that will ensure secure land ownership by the Fulani. Development initiatives in the area should also focus on reinforcing those traditional practices of the Fulani that would guarantee a sustainable land-use system in the area.

AB Studies on insect reproduction in The Netherlands concern long-term projects on (a) the relationship between diapause and reproduction, (b) endocrinology and reproduction, (c) the relationship between food and reproduction, and more recently on (d) the background and evolution of parthenogenetic reproduction, (e) the link between reproduction and blood and sugar feeding in mosquitoes, and (f) the role of male sex-peptides in reproduction and mate protection. Examples of this work are presented and the importance of these fundamental studies to applied work will be discussed. At universities, curiosity-driven pure research on reproduction should have the first priority and this type of research will almost always result in applications, as we have experienced in insect pest management. Modern agriculture leads to serious environmental problems, human health problems and a dramatic reduction in biodiversity, as a result of intensive fertilizer use and frequent application of chemical pesticides. Pure scientific research in insect reproduction is enabling us to fmd unexpected solutions for crop protection problems in current agriculture; for example, we have helped to develop (a) programs with greatly reduced applications of conventional chemicals based on our diapause work, (b) selective chemical control with insect growth regulators based on endocrinological studies, and (c) more economic biological control programs based on diapause and parthenogenesis studies.

TI The challenge of sustainability at the farm level: Presidential address
SO JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
LA English
DT Article
ID AGRICULTURAL SUSTAINABILITY; INDICATORS; SYSTEMS; ECONOMICS; UK
AB The sustainability of farming systems is currently under debate. There is concern that technological and other changes have long-run consequences, which may compromise future levels of desired outputs from agricultural and other resources. The paper traces developments in the theory of sustainability and discusses their application at the farm level. Findings include firstly, that sustainability should be regarded as an emergent property of an agricultural system. Its operational definition at the farm level thus may not apply at other levels in the hierarchy. Secondly, whilst individual farmers may attach value to "sustainability" goods, they are unlikely to adopt socially optimal levels without regulation or incentive. Finally, since sustainability issues at the farm level are usually long-run, dynamic and have social dimensions, a central task for farm management researchers lies in investigations which allow tradeoffs between different sustainability criteria to be determined and then optimised according to society's norms.

AB In many countries, water allocation has become increasingly controversial as competition has increased. This paper summarizes a research programme of seven studies over 10 years that has developed social psychological theories of justice, equity and fairness for application to the implementation and evaluation of wafer allocation decisions. Much of the research has been conducted in the context of the development of government sponsored wafer reform in Australia. This reform has emphasized the need for integrated approaches to water management which encourage efficiency of use through markets, and environmental sustainability through the introduction of environmental (in-stream) flows. The initial study tested the adequacy of equity and procedural justice theories to provide explanations about people's evaluation of decisionmaking in the context of water allocation. They were found to provide insufficient scope for the evaluations. Therefore, the second and third studies developed alternative universal fairness principles and adopted the fairness heuristic as a concept for judging the justice of individual water allocation decisions. It was found that the public's universal fairness principles in contrasting allocation case studies were relatively stable over a decade, and provide criteria for judging allocation decisions. Water was consistently seen as a public good; the environment was seen to have rights to water; and procedural issues were important in allocation decision-making. The most recent four studies have shifted to the local or situational fairness contexts. These four studies examined the justice or fairness principles that were appropriate for decision-making when irrigation communities were faced with possible decreased allocations to provide for environmental sustainability. Three studies were survey based, and one was an action research project to develop fairness based rules for community management. The conclusion from these four studies was that local procedural justice issues, particularly those pertaining to public involvement for local people in decision-making, were significant determinants of judgements of the fairness of the decisions. Economic considerations had some importance, but were not the over-riding issues, and water markets were seen as unacceptable processes for wafer allocation or re-allocation. The research also provided evidence that self-interest is tempered by pro-social motivations such as fairness when making water-allocation decisions. Finally, if was evident that the public could make relatively complex judgements which used dimensions that go beyond the scope of traditional social psychological definitions of equity and procedural justice.

AB The impact of organic production practices on soil quality indicators, for selected farms in Nebraska and North Dakota, were evaluated to better understand their effects on soil quality and sustainability. Conventional production practices were the standard to which the effects of organic production were compared. Five organic and conventional farms, matched by soil type, were chosen for the study, Soil properties recognized as basic soil quality indicators were measured on each farm at depths of 0 to 7.6 and 0 to 30.5 cm, Averaged across locations, there was 22% more organic C (12 571 kg ha-(1)) and 20% more total N (970 kg ha(-1)) on organic farms than conventional farms in the surface 30.5 cm, At four of five locations, organic farms had soil pH closer to neutral, lower bulk density, and higher available-water holding capacity, microbial biomass C and N, and soil respiration as compared with conventional farms. Nutrient levels above crop needs were observed in both organic and conventional farms indicating the potential for negative environmental impacts. Despite this, organic farms often had more potentially mineralizable N (anaerobic incubation) relative to NO3-N in the surface 30.5 cm. For conditions of this study, the capacity of organic production practices to improve soil quality was mainly due to use of more diverse crop sequences, application of organic: amendments, and less frequent tillage.

AB Quantifying the locomotor forces experienced by swimming fishes represents a significant challenge because direct measurements of force applied to the aquatic medium are not feasible, However, using the technique of digital particle image velocimetry (DPIV), it is possible to quantify the effect of fish fins on water movement and hence to estimate momentum transfer from the animal to the fluid. We used DPIV to visualize water how in the wake of the pectoral fins of bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus) swimming at speeds of 0.5-1.5 L s(-1), where L is total body length. Velocity fields quantified in three perpendicular planes in the wake of the fins allowed three-dimensional reconstruction of downstream vortex structures, At low swimming speed (0.5 L s(-1)), vorticity is shed by each fin during the downstroke and stroke reversal to generate discrete, roughly symmetrical, vortex rings of near-uniform circulation with a central jet of high-velocity flow. At and above the maximum sustainable labriform swimming speed of 1.0 L s(-1), additional vorticity appears on the upstroke, indicating the production of linked pairs of rings by each fin. Fluid velocity measured in the vicinity of the fin indicates that substantial spanwise flow during the downstroke may occur as vortex rings are formed. The forces excited by the fins on the water in three dimensions were calculated from vortex ring orientation and momentum, Mean wake-derived thrust (11.1 mN) and lift (3.2 mN) forces produced by both fins per stride at 0.5 L s(-1) were found to match closely empirically determined counter-forces of body drag and weight. Medially directed reaction forces were unexpectedly large, averaging 125 % of the thrust force for each fin. Such large inward forces and a deep body that isolates left- and right-side vortex rings are predicted to aid maneuverability. The observed force balance indicates that DPIV can be used to measure accurately large-scale vorticity in the wake of swimming fishes and is therefore a valuable means of studying unsteady flows produced by animals moving through fluids.

ID FUTURE
AB Recent evolution in the practice of forestry can be linked to changes in the public's perception of sustainability and to developments in science, communications, and global markets. In response,when hiring graduates of professional forestry programs, forestry employers have changed the set of skills and competencies sought. A nationwide survey of forestry employers,educators,and recent graduates, conducted to assess how well US forestry programs are preparing professionals to practice forestry today, reveals some discrepancies between what employers want and what the schools provide. External financial and political pressures on higher education make it difficult for educators to close these gaps, but opportunities exist for employers to help.

ID IVORY-COAST; STATE
AB This article first explores the manner in which the colonial and postcolonial state in Cote d'Ivoire has sought to develop and animate rural cooperatives as a means of effecting change in the countryside. It then examines the local realities that the state has encountered in its attempt to organise and control rural cooperatives. In particular, the article shows how ethnicity, age, and contrasting economic interests have undermined state efforts to create sustainable and effective rural cooperatives at the village level. Finally, the article looks at how structural adjustment has led to the retreat of the state and the emergence of a more pluralistic environment in which different rural associations are now competing to represent the interests of rural producers.

AB This article examines whether and in what ways curricular approaches can be helpful in building positive interethnic relations in a large, ethnically diverse high school. Through this case study of curricular reform, the author documents four curricular approaches teacher leaders used to explicitly address issues of race and ethnicity and explores the impact of these approaches on student learning. By tracing the process of curricular change, the case illuminates how teacher leaders and administrators created the conditions for these curricular reforms to be sustainable.

AB political ecology is the inquiry into the political causes and consequences of environmental change, with the goal of facilitating sustainable development through the reconstruction of social and political systems. In this introductory paper, I consider how political ecology might become a productive area of inquiry for planning theorists. After surveying political ecology's topical and intellectual terrain, I link the field to theory through the consideration of several planning models and roles. I argue that Deweyan pragmatism by method of social inquiry and communitarian politics, provides an appropriate philosophical basis for integrating political ecology into planning theory.

ID VARIETY-SEEKING BEHAVIOR; CONSUMER PREFERENCE; PURCHASE QUANTITY;
   HIGHER-QUALITY; CHOICE; PRICE; PERCEPTIONS; FORMAT
AB Using product assortment to gain a sustainable differentiation is becoming increasingly difficult in the current retail environment and is likely to become evert more challenging as the importance of location continues to decline and the share of Internet-based retailing increases. Recent research, however, suggests that product assortment can play a key role, not only in satisfying wants, but also in influencing buyer wants and preferences. This article reviews and synthesizes empirical evidence indicating that (a) retailers can use the assortment subset that buyers consider to enhance the likelihood that a purchase will be made and to affect the specific option selected (b) the manner in which the set of considered options are presented also affects buyer preferences and purchase decisions, and, (c) the effects of the considered options and presentation format interact with other elements of the marketing mit such as sales promotions. The implications of these findings for retailers, including ethical aspects of influencing buyer preferences, are discussed.

TI Outcomes of social and environmental change in the Kalahari of Botswana:
   the role of migration
SO JOURNAL OF SOUTHERN AFRICAN STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
ID GENDER; HOUSEHOLDS; IMPACTS
AB Migration now features prominently both in poverty-reduction discourses, as a 'tool' for reconciling rural populations with available resources, and in sustainable livelihoods debates, as a 'coping strategy' employed in rimes of livelihood stress. This paper assesses the contemporary significance of migration as populations are affected by the dual impacts of natural environmental variability and structural land-use change in the Kalahari of Botswana. Three study areas, located across the arid to dry-sub-humid climatic gradient, were investigated. These had been redesignated as commercial ranching areas under the Tribal Gracing Lands Policy of 1975. Under this policy, pre-existing populations were to be resettled in specially designated Service Centres that were expected to reduce poverty and improve livelihood opportunities and household food security. The findings of this study reveal that the policy was accompanied by extensive population displacement rather than migration per se as ranch owners exercised their exclusive rights to the land. While some ranch populations moved to Service Centres, lack of infrastructure and alternative livelihood opportunities forced many of them back into ranch areas It here many now live as squatters dependent on the goodwill of ranch owners. Thus the policy has not resulted in envisaged sedentarisation but instead has produced a population of transients involved in a number of highly localised moves. The mobility patterns of absent householders provided some evidence to suggest that, despite rapid urbanisation, rural to urban migration from the study areas was limited as were associated remittance flows, suggesting that TGLP areas may not be currently integrated within a national migration system. There were significant differences in the implementation of the policy between study areas and these differences have had a considerable bearing on the population's ability to respond to environmental variability. In one of the Study Areas (Ncojane), severe drought has resulted in a more flexible implementation of ranches: fences had been taken down, and people and cattle were able to more between ranches in search of water and veld products. Population mobility here was thus a significantly coping strategy, ironically where commercial ranch owners had reverted back to the old cattle-post system which emphasises circulation and reciprocity.

ID DEVELOPMENT ORGANIZATIONS
AB International non-government organisations (INGOs) are increasingly regarded as important in their capacity to influence global policy on development matters such as poverty alleviation, sustainable development, and human rights. This has been possible through their simultaneous attachment to places and local cultures on the one hand, and their critical engagement with the global on the other. With recent advances in information and communication technologies, an increasingly connected INGO community is finding consideration scope for networking and information sharing at multiple levels.
   However, despite the strategic advantage of INGOs in terms of their multi-level reach, their contribution to date remains limited to small-scale success stories rather than affecting large-scale development. In this paper, we emphasise the importance for INGOs to learn from the field in their quest to influence wider policy-making and improve local accountability. We argue that as their role changes from operational work to international advocacy, INGOs will have to strengthen institutional structures and learning skills to achieve a greater developmental impact.

AB Although a large body of research theoretically asserts a positive relationship between market orientation and organizational performance, fewer empirical studies demonstrate it using multiple and varied organizational performance measures. Additionally, a series of recent studies have theoretically proposed, but not empirically demonstrated, that a firm's learning orientation is likely to indirectly affect organizational performance by improving the quality of its market-oriented behaviors and directly influence organizational performance by facilitating the type of generative learning that leads to innovations in products, procedures, and systems. This empirical study supports all of these specific contentions and the more global notion that higher order learning processes may be critical in creating a sustainable competitive advantage in the firm.

TI Presidential address: Coal - An industry in change
SO JOURNAL OF THE SOUTH AFRICAN INSTITUTE OF MINING AND METALLURGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Coal has been at the forefront of mankind's drive to improve his quality of life and also for sustainable development, from the Industrial Revolution onwards. The international coal industry today is large, with some 3,7 billion tons being produced and consumed in 1997.
   South Africa is an important participant in the coal industry, selling some 220 million tons in 1997 of which 64 million tons were exported. It Is the second-largest thermal coal exporting country in the world.
   Despite the size of the world coal industry, it is not immune to change.
   The address examines growth projections for the industry and the change drivers that will impact on it in the future.
   Environmental pressures, the most important of which being the climate change debate, the Kyoto Protocol arising from this debate and the development of dean coal technologies, to reduce the impact of coal production and usage on the environment are considered.
   Other major change drivers considered are competition from other sources of energy and that between coal producers, the deregulation of the electric power industry, corporate restructuring and for the South African producer, legislative reform. The declining (real term) coal price, the consequent squeeze on margins and the need for producers to actively contain costs is covered.
   Technology has, in the past, been the driver behind the growth and change of the South African coal industry and its future role in ensuring that coal is the fuel of choice for continued improvement in standards of living and economic development is addressed.

AB PURPOSE: To evaluate short-term flow rates achieved with a new split-tip polyurethane hemodialysis catheter.
   PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a prospective, randomized, nonblinded study. Patients referred for a tunneled-dialysis catheter received either a conventional silicone (Bard Hickman 13.5 F) if randomized to the control group, or a split-tip, high-flow polyurethane (MedComp AshSplit 14.5 F) catheter if randomized to the study group. Effective flow rates (QbEff) and recirculation were measured with use of ultrasonic dilution at pump settings (Qb) of 200, 300, 350 and 400 mL/min, as well as maximum Qb (QbMax; up to 500 mL/min) sustainable for at least 3 minutes. Measurements were repeated weekly for 6 weeks. Procedure times and initial and late complications were recorded.
   RESULTS: Twelve patients were enrolled in each group, 11 and eight completed the study in the test and control groups, respectively. Insertion complications, limited to the split-tip group, included asymptomatic air embolus (n = 1), prolonged tunnel bleeding (n = 2), and kinking (n = 2). Recirculation in both groups was low (mean < 6% at all flow rates). QbMax was 499 mL/min in the Ash group and 470 mL/min in the Hickman group. A repeated measures analysis of variance was used. Adjusted (for week) mean effective flow rates (Qbeff, mL/min) were as follows: at Qb = 200, Ash = 211, Bard = 211, P = .93; at Qb = 300, Ash = 301, Bard = 292, P = .28; at Qb = 350, Ash = 341, Bard = 314, P = .03; at Qb = 400, Ash = 375, Bard = 329, P = .01; at QbMax, Ash = 422, Bard = 359, P = .0005.
   CONCLUSION: Both catheters delivered flows within the acceptable range indicated by the Dialysis Outcomes Quality Initiative. The split-tip catheter is capable of higher flow rates (Qb and QbEff) compared with. the conventional catheter, which may allow more efficient dialysis;Insertion complications appear to be higher with the new design.

ID SOUTHEASTERN NIGERIA
AB In areas susceptible to erosion, there is the need for a comprehensive soil conservation programme so as to be able to prevent catastrophic soil erosion problems. The absence of such a programme in central eastern Nigeria, that has a total land area of 20 000 km(2), necessitated the drawing up of a soil conservation strategy for the area. The aim was to provide information for better land-use planning and proper environmental and soil management. To achieve this, topographic, soil and landform maps of the area at the scale of 1 :50 000 were used to delineate into slope land units, viz: 0-4 per cent, <4 per cent, drainage basins and headwaters. These slope units and estimated soil erosion hazard units using the revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE) were employed to form a general purpose land classification based on the USDA land capability classification and FAO framework on land evaluation.
   The soil loss tolerance of the area falls between 1.16 and 1.30 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) while the erosion hazard units are considered generally suitable for the various land utilization types, with a number of limitations the main ones being erosion and waterlogging. The soil conservation measures proposed involved the application of bioenvironmental processes in the area and appropriate watershed management. The techniques proposed are those based on low input technology, affordable by rural farmers. It is concluded that these soil conservation measures will be adequate for sustainable agricultural production in the area. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

DE Australia; land tenure; land degradation; sustainability; environmental

AB Land degradation and its management have profound effects on environmental quality and sustainability. Given the diverse range of environmental conditions and land uses across Australia, it is not uncommon for land degradation to occur on many different tenure types. This paper presents an analysis of the relationships between soil physical and chemical limitations, different degradation types and their interactions with varying tenure classes.
   Three continental scale datasets were used in this analysis to analyse degradation propensity in Australian land tenure systems. The datasets comprised: The Australian Land Information Groups (AUSLIG) Land Tenure classification at a 1:5 million scale; the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO)/Bureau of Resource Sciences (BRS) Soil Limitations for Agriculture classification at a 1:2 million scale; and a BRS classification of land degradation types and occurrence in Australia at a 1:20 million scale. The continental coverages were rasterized and summarized as a three-way contingency table of counts. The analysis of the three-way contingency table included: summary histograms; a non-parametric analysis of the cumulative empirical distribution functions; and the use of a generalized linear model (GLM).
   Over 60 per cent of the Australian continent is classified and used as agricultural land, which has a significant influence on the Australian environment. These agricultural lands are predominantly divided into two tenure types: freehold (20 per cent) and crown leasehold (42 per cent). The analysis indicates that although crown leasehold land has a large percentage of lands vulnerable to degradation, these lands are less degraded than the freehold lands, which have fewer soil physical and chemical limitations to agriculture.

AB The recent agricultural policies in the Sudan have focused on mechanized large-scale, rainfed agricultural ventures achieving increased grain production through expansion of the cultivated area only, not through increased per unit yield. The total harvested area increased steadily from about 4.5 million ha in 1961 to about 14 million ha in 1996, with great year-to-year variations of harvested areas, and therefore total yields, revealing a fragile balance between production and need. Per unit yields of all crops are steadily decreasing, currently reaching rates far below their genetic potential. The work reported here was intended to look into the causes of the fluctuations in yield and to propose some strategic approaches that may offer a path to sustainability of such crop production.
   Several factors may be contributing to these poor yields. This study shows that loss of soil fertility and rainfall variability are among such factors. Crops yields were negatively correlated at a one per cent level of significance with the cropping season indicating significant decline in soil fertility. Soil fertility management and fertilizers use could therefore be of great importance in formulating proactive strategies to enhance productivity in the rainfed agriculture in the Sudan. Rainfall in different production subregions had different levels of correlation with yields of all crops. Comparison of long-term rainfall in the four subregions of the study area showed that rainfall decline had been in the magnitude of 30-40 per cent. The western parts of the study area (Kordofan and Dal-fur) experienced extreme rainfall anomalies than the eastern and central parts (Gedaref and Damazin), and had suffered greater periods of desiccation than the eastern and central parts. The decadal rainfall means showed below average rainfall for the last three decades in all subregions; the western parts again showing greatest desiccation. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Analysts agree that raising national saving is one of the key objectives of Social Security reform. Hence, to judge the merits of proposals requires comparison of saving responses. The paper outlines the difficulties in making those comparisons that arise from the unsustainability of the current Social Security system and the uncertainty regarding the use of projected future budget surpluses. Building on previously developed arguments, it discusses three typical reform plans and also draws some conclusions about the relationship between Social Security reform and the long-run sustainability of fiscal policy.

AB Planted forests in many forms are parts of landscapes in many regions of the world. These forests contribute to the economic welfare and potential sustainability of human communities. They provide wood, forage, wildlife habitats, watershed protection, recreational settings, aesthetic vistas, and ecological conditions for many other forest values. Forests and other versions of tree plantations have been planted to replace harvested Douglas-fir forests in Oregon, to provide fuelwood and forage in Senegal, for pulpwood in Brazil, for lumber in New Zealand, for watershed protection in Nepal, and for aesthetic enhancement in Scotland and Denmark. As human pressures on native forests continue to increase - for reasons ranging from fuelwood needs to desires to preserve old-growth ecosystems - it is clear to many of us that planted forests, intensively and extensively managed, are essential to our present and future societies and cultures, whatever forms they take.

DE forestry objectives; multiple-use forestry; silviculture; afforestation;

AB Following the introduction of planned forestry and the regular high forest system more than 250 years ago, forests in Central Europe became increasingly shaped by plantation silviculture. Many natural woodlands were replaced by planted forests, and forest plantations are still being established through afforestation of extensive land areas. Nowadays, forests are managed for many different purposes, including wood production, recreation, ecological, cultural, and amenity values, biodiversity, and soil and groundwater protection. This brings new challenges to forest management and silviculture. To reach a sustainable forestry, in the sense of Brundtland (WCED 1987), we are now reshaping European forestry toward a more nature oriented silviculture. Maybe forestry in the United States and elsewhere can benefit from the mistakes made in Europe during the last two centuries and take a shortcut toward sustainable forestry.

AB Planting trees in tropical countries is an increasingly important forestry activity. Although much attention has been paid, and rightly so, to rapid deforestation in the tropics, the contribution and role that planted forests can play are now at the center of policy and planning in most national forestry strategies. The changing emphasis from exploitative management of natural forests to managed natural forests and plantation forests, seen in temperate regions over the last 100 years, has been taking place in tropical countries largely over the last 20 years. In neither temperate nor tropical regions has this evolution finished.
   Planted forests will increasingly furnish wood resources that meet domestic wood needs and provide many environmental services. In this paper I seek to place in perspective the contribution that planted forests will make in the tropics. I emphasize (1) the wide variety of purposes that planted forests serve; (2) the sustainability of plantation silviculture; and (3) the overriding importance of due regard to people's participation. I am optimistic about the great value that planted forests, rightly used, can provide for a great many hard-pressed peoples across the tropics and beyond.

AB This paper reviews the historical development of the use of the eucalypt over 200 years, from its curiosity status in the botanical gardens of Europe to its extensive use as a fuelwood for the wood-burning locomotives of the national railway systems, and then to its more recent use as a major source of biomass for paper pulp, fiberboard, industrial charcoal, and fuelwood. Ecological and biological aspects of the genus Eucalyptus have made it successful as an exotic in industrial monocultures and as a multipurpose tree of benefit to small landholders. Social, policy, and economic aspects of growing Eucalyptus are examined, as are prospects for using the eucalypt in the twenty-first century as an industrial plantation tree and as a component of farming systems in the rural landscape.

AB A combination of superior wood quality and high productivity has made Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii [Mirb.] Franco) one of the premier timber trees in the world. As such, it is grown as a plantation species in several countries in Europe, South America, New Zealand, and Australia, as well as throughout its extensive natural range in western North America. Decades of experience with the silviculture of young stands have demonstrated that practices such as planting, the use of genetically improved seedlings, precommercial and commercial thinning, and fertilization may dramatically increase the yield of industrial products over that of natural forests. Further, such silviculture is compatible with the production of desired amenities. Vigorous implementation of such practices wherever Douglas-fir is cultivated will increase the world's timber resources, and be an effective strategy for reducing the pressure, occasioned by the world's rapidly increasing population, to harvest the fragile tropical and boreal forests.

AB Loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) was a minor component of the vast natural forests of the southern United States before the region was settled by immigrants. Extensive planting and natural regeneration of cutover forest land and abandoned farmland between 1930 and 1990 made loblolly the leading timber species in the United States. It now predominates on 13.4 million ha (45 percent) of the commercial forest land in the southern United States (between latitudes 28 degrees N and 39 degrees N and longitudes 75 degrees W and 97 degrees W) and directly or indirectly provides 110,000 jobs and $30 billion to the economy of the region. The extreme versatility of loblolly has also provided important environmental contributions to most southern states. These include landscape beautification, erosion control, soil amelioration, excellent wildlife habitat, and outstanding recreational opportunities. Incorporating existing pest management strategies into silvicultural systems can produce substantial and long-lasting insect and disease control with little cost or physical effort. Introductions of loblolly into numerous countries around the world (especially China, Brazil, and Argentina) have proven to be very successful, environmentally sound, and commercially profitable. In some locations, loblolly grows much faster than on sites of similar quality in the southern United States.

DE wood supply; Monterey pine; New Zealand forests; sustainability
AB Ten thousand years ago our 5 million hunter-gatherer ancestors used, over the period of a year, about 200 species of local food items. Now, the nearly 6 billion global population gets 70 percent of its food from nine species of plants, one species of bird, and two species of mammals. This is despite global access to about 50,000 edible plants, as well as large numbers of bird and other animal species. We have concentrated our agricultural efforts on those species which are the most desirable, the most convenient, the most productive, and the most easily stored. Of equal importance, the species must be responsive to both genetic improvement and to management manipulation (i.e., domestication). Globally, very little of our food, except fish, now comes from wild sources.
   Although we use at least as much wood as we do food, wood supply (which still comes mostly from natural forests) is only now becoming limiting. There are no energy-efficient or environmentally acceptable substitutes for wood. The most likely means we have of satisfying the increasing global demand for wood is to obtain more of our wood from deliberately planted forests. Management of planted forests will increasingly parallel intensive agriculture. One consequence is that, of the 1,000 tree species we now use globally, we may eventually get most of our wood from four or five species. One of these tree species will be radiata pine (Pinus radiata D. Don). Radiata grows fast on a wide range of sites, has desirable wood properties, and responds well to both genetic improvement and stand management. The planted forest technology for radiata pine is probably the most advanced of any potential tree species. The evolution and success of radiata pine in New Zealand has major implications and lessons for the rest of the world.

DE Weyerhaeuser; high yield forestry; sustainability
AB Privately owned tree farms and plantations share many characteristics of natural forests, multiple purpose forests, and fiber plantations. Tree farms and plantations are managed primarily for the sustainable production of solid wood and fiber; however, they increasingly play an important role in protecting all forest values. This rapidly changing role poses a challenge to forest managers - to increase productivity to meet spiraling worldwide demand while satisfying public expectations for preserving and enhancing a full range of forest resources.
   These heightened expectations are prompting tree farm and plantation managers to modify proven management regimes in order to protect water quality, fish and wildlife habitat, soil productivity, and aesthetics. Proactive measures, such as establishing goals for each stewardship objective, defining measurement criteria, and third-party endorsement or certification, are helping forest managers identify and address improvement opportunities. Each of these stewardship objectives, though, can imply trade-offs in terms of yield and utilization, thus reducing the economic attractiveness of the forestry investment.
   In this period of rapid change, one effective strategy is to engage the public in the front end of the forest planning process. By listening and responding to public concerns, establishing common values, and allowing the public to judge us by our actions, we can begin to create awareness and trust. Only then will we attain the stable regulatory platform that is imperative for making long-term forestry investments and implementing science-based mechanisms for meaningful ecosystem enhancement.

AB The history of the legislative basis for managing National Forests in the USA has led to forests managed for multiple uses for a wide diversity of users and interests. Evolution of emphasis on National Forests from mandates to "preserve and protect'' and provide "a continuous supply of timber'' to concerns about owls, ecosystem management and contemporary rural development have included changes in on-the-ground forest management. All of these phases include needs for planted forests established and maintained for multiple purposes and benefits.

DE planted forests; short-rotation species; ecological impacts; economic
   viability
AB The importance of planted forests for human communities is evident today because of the increase in world population year after year. In order to supply the constantly increasing requirements for wood for fiber, energy, civil construction, resin, latex, and other needs, new forests have been established by adopting new concepts of technology. These forests, especially those with fast-growing and short-rotation species, incorporate the objectives of quality, productivity, and environmental protection.
   The Eucalyptus plantations established by Aracruz Celulose S. A. to produce pulpwood have strongly contributed to the evolution of forest science, especially in the fields of silviculture, propagation, improvement, genetics, biotechnology, nutrition, environment, and disease control related to eucalypt species. Significant investments in research and development were required, as well as technological adaptation to the local conditions. Results of these investments in productivity and quality defined the technical feasibility to build a pulp industry and its expansion to reach 1,025,000 t/yr of bleached pulp.
   As a result of these advances, the mean increment of pulp productivity has been improved significantly - from 5.9 air-dried t/ha/yr to 10.9 t/ha/yr (Fenton and Romero 1995; Bertolucci et al. 1995). This became possible by selecting trees more adapted to each site, with high yields of high quality fiber, and with eucalypt clonal plantations with an average rotation age of 7 years. Additional studies of Aracruz have promoted advances in industrial processes, as well as definition of fiber characteristics of mother trees to be in attendance with requirements of markets, thus providing an important competitive advantage (Campinhos and Claudio-da-Silva 1990).
   The care for the environment - both forest and industrial - has been always present and has been the key point for the good performance of the project. This fact has created a world emulation that strongly contributes to decreasing the pressures on native forests, as a result of the consequent utilization of smaller land areas to produce a desired wood volume. This total project is an example of domestication (Eldridge et al. 1994) of the forest genus Eucalyptus with exceptional qualities and represented by more than 500 species and hybrids (Campinhos et al. 1992).

AB Planted forests are often considered to consist of tree plantings at a scale large enough to satisfy such objectives as commercial production of timber and fiber, protection of watersheds, and preservation of natural habitats. However, trees are planted also at greatly reduced scales in agroforestry systems or as community woodlots to provide a mixture of products and services to resident households, local communities, and regional cultures.
   Agroforestry systems represent a major form of small-scale tree planting, where trees are grown in purposeful combinations with agricultural crops and/or livestock in order to take advantage of tree-crop interactions, and thereby enhance crop production, diversify farm output, stabilize or improve soils, or ameliorate harsh environmental conditions. Some important examples of these systems in tropical countries include homegardens, alley cropping, improved fallows, intercropped trees for shade and fodder production, and trees planted in hedgerows and along fence lines. Throughout the tropics, there is a large variety of indigenous practices and species mixtures that represent adaptations of these systems to meet localized needs and opportunities. Research and development programs have supported the expansion and refinement of many of these systems during the last 20 years, but substantial constraints on tree planting still exist in the form of land-tenure practices, population pressures that relegate agroforestry practices to degraded lands, subsistence needs that prevent extended periods of tree growth, and insufficient technical information or technology dissemination.
   Agroforestry systems in temperate, industrialized countries include combinations of trees, pasture, and livestock; fruit or nut trees interplanted with vegetable or grain crops; windbreaks and shelterbelts; multispecies riparian buffer strips; and forest farming systems for specialty crops. Compared to the tropics, however, temperate-zone systems tend to focus on one or two high-value crops, often involve some level of mechanization, and frequently represent an opportunistic approach to improving the economic profitability of farms rather than meeting subsistence needs. In both tropical and temperate regions, agroforestry systems and community woodlots will be an important component of new sustainable agriculture and environmental protection programs.
   Although species diversity is an essential feature of all agroforestry systems, community forests generally involve planting only a few species in small woodlots near farms, around villages, along roads, and as riparian buffers. Provincial or state governments and the local populace are often involved in landownership and plantation establishment. Major objectives of these forests are production of fuelwood for local consumption and of other tree products for market; soil stabilization, reclamation, or improvement; and protection of water quality. As with many other planted forests, the number of species widely used in community forests has been relatively small, with the genera Eucalyptus, Pinus, and Acacia providing the bulk of the species. Major issues with these "planted forests'' focus on rights for use of the products, tending responsibilities once trees are established, protection until trees are large enough for their designated use, increasing interest in using "native'' species, and greater community involvement in planning and management.
   Trees planted along streets and waterways, or as woodlots in parks and other public places, represent a major group of planted forests in many urban and periurban landscapes. In addition to providing many of the same environmental services that agroforests and community forests do, these urban plantings have unique aesthetic and recreational value. For much of the world's ever-increasing urban population, these may be the only tangible reference points for understanding planted forests.
   These relatively little-recognized forms of planted forests - planted trees, to be more appropriate - are now receiving much greater attention. There are, however, some serious technical and sociopolitico-institutional constraints to their development as more widely adopted systems in both tropical and temperate regions.

AB Although the phrase, "planting for ecosystem restoration,'' is of recent origin, many of the earliest large-scale tree plantings were made for what we now refer to as "restoration'' or "conservation'' goals. Forest restoration activities may be needed when ecosystems are disturbed by either natural or anthropogenic forces. Disturbances can impact (1) basic components of the system (e.g., plant and animal composition, soil pools, and atmospheric pools), (2) ecosystem processes, i.e., interactions among basic components, or (3) both components and processes. Early efforts at restoration or site rehabilitation focused primarily on reducing off-site impacts, such as sediment introduced into streams from ecosystems that had been severely disturbed. More recent restoration programs include ecosystems in which only some of the components are missing or some of the processes have been impacted. Restoration activities can begin immediately after the disturbance has ended. Although forest restoration projects can include many activities, planting is almost always a key component.
   When planning an ecosystem restoration project, land managers need to be aware that commonly used plant establishment and management procedures may need to be altered to meet project objectives. Some systems may have been so severely impacted that ameliorative activities, e.g., fertilization, liming, land contouring, and microsite preparation, will be necessary prior to planting. Managers may also need to take special measures to reduce herbivory, control competing vegetation, or reduce physical damage from wind or sun. Choice of species needs careful consideration. Desired species may not grow well on degraded sites, may need a nurse species to become established, or may not provide an opportunity to harvest a short-term crop to reduce restoration costs. New methods may need to be developed for projects that require underplanting or interplanting. The end result of restoration should be an ecosystem with the same level of heterogeneity inherent in an undisturbed system; thus, managers should consider how pre- and postplanting activities will affect system variability.
   As our understanding of ecosystems has increased, so has our expectation that restored ecosystems have the same components and function in the same manner as do undisturbed systems. These expectations require that land managers have more sophisticated information than was considered necessary previously. In the absence of more pertinent information, we can prescribe restoration activities based on results from related ecosystems or on theoretical considerations. Additional research, careful monitoring, and adaptive management are critical to our long-term success.

ID FORESTS; ENERGY
AB Attitudes of human societies toward tree plantations can be a critical factor in determining the source of wood supply in the future. Because human populations will expand substantially in the next century, considerable increases in the demands on native forests will occur. Currently, only a limited amount of tree plantations have been established specifically to provide firewood in developing countries. This may be the result, in part, of a world society that has evolved a general preference for pastures, but an aversion to tree plantations. In total, pastureland and tree plantations amount to 26 percent and 1 percent of the world's land base, respectively. Nevertheless, our actions today will determine whether children in the future collect firewood from natural stands or from tree plantations. It is estimated that a substantial afforestation program could increase the amount of tree plantations to equal 5 percent of the world's land base by the year 2050. Ten billion dollars (United States) is a rough estimate of the annual costs for such a program (assuming no overhead or administrative costs). Most of the wood needs could be met from tree plantations. However, if the world's society wants most of its wood in 2050 to come from natural stands (> 80 percent), then tree plantations can be limited to just 1 percent of the land base.

DE disease; forest health; insects; sustainability
AB Losses through reduced growth or mortality attributable to pests, diseases, and abiotic disturbances are generally less in intensively managed, planted forests than in natural forests. Among plantation forests, the most healthy forests are those of exotic species growing a long way from their native range (e.g., Pinus radiata D. Don in New Zealand) and the least healthy ones are those of indigenous species (e.g., Eucalyptus nitens (Deane & Maiden) Maiden in Tasmania). The better health of plantations is a reflection of the generally good growing conditions, the proper matching of site to species that is possible in artificial culture and in the case of exotic species, the freedom from the many pests and diseases present in the native habitat of exotics.

AB A broad assessment is given of the contentions that plantation forests are high consumers of water, increase acidification, sustain a low diversity of wildlife, and store more carbon than do unmanaged forests. The following conclusions are drawn: (1) Evapotranspiration from planted forest monocultures is greater than from short vegetation, as a result of greater interception loss. Water loss from conifer forests is usually greater than from deciduous hardwoods, but evapotranspiration from Eucalyptus in the dry tropics is often no greater than from native hardwoods. (2) Compared to short vegetation, forests can significantly increase the transfer of acidifying pollutants from the air to the soil and surface waters, and conifers are more likely to enhance acidification than are hardwoods. (3) There are normally sufficient plantation management options available to make most plantation landscapes the homes of a rich diversity of flora and fauna. (4) An area covered with a plantation managed for maximum volume yield will normally contain substantially less carbon than the same area of unmanaged forest.

AB Planted forests have more than a millennium of history and represent the world's best hope for meeting global wood requirements in the twenty-first century. Advances in genetic improvement, nursery practices, stand establishment, and tending, harvesting, and manufacturing have boosted plantation yields to a higher level than at any point in history. Despite this, forest managers face a mounting challenge to demonstrate that plantation productivity is sustainable. Tackling this challenge requires a sound understanding of the principles of forest productivity, how they apply to a developing plantation, and how they are influenced by management. In this paper criticisms of plantation forestry are discussed from the basis of world experience, and examples of productivity decline are described. Obvious declines are rare, and can be attributed to poor soil management. However, ambiguities exist and controversy will continue until sustainable productivity can be demonstrated conclusively. Proposed programs aim to provide the technical base needed for sound soil management and sustainable plantation productivity.

   markets; timber supply
AB Private timberlands in the United States have the biological potential to provide larger quantities of timber on a sustainable basis than they do today. Most opportunities for increasing growth and harvest lie on nonindustrial private lands in the South. Past studies, based on fixed scenarios of future prices, also suggest that many of these opportunities for intensified management can be undertaken with positive economic returns. Translation of these physical and apparent economic potentials into projections of future management and harvest requires a model of private timber management investment behavior. This study examines the dynamics of investment in private forest management according to a model of timber markets and timber supply in which intertemporal levels of private investment, harvest, and timber prices are all endogenous. The results of this model are used to examine the extent and types of possible future private management investments and how these will affect timber supply. In addition, the sensitivity of these projections to variations in key market and behavioral determinants is examined through simulation of alternative scenarios involving reduced public timber harvest and constraints on planting investment of nonindustrial private owners.
   The base case illustrates the substantial potential of timberlands for increased growth and harvest. This requires, however, investments in planting well beyond those observed in recent years. Given this, the area in planted forests would almost triple within the next 30 years. Expanded investment would allow immediate increases in timber harvest and sustained increases in timber inventory, with virtually no trend in softwood log prices. Projected increases in plantation area would concentrate timber production on fewer hectares, with more hectares managed passively. Naturally regenerated forests in the future would cover at least three-quarters of the private timberland area, with hardwoods continuing to dominate. Restricting nonindustrial private plantation investment to levels observed in the recent past markedly alters projections for softwoods, thus raising prices and reducing timber harvest relative to the base case across the full projection period. In contrast, reductions in public timber harvest alone result in increased prices and reduced total cut in the near term, but have limited impact on the outlook three-five decades hence, because private investment effectively compensates for public timber harvest reductions.

DE customers; certification; forest products; multilateral governments
AB Today several global forces are raising expectations that forestry must be practiced on a sustainable basis. This is true for forestry as practiced in tropical, temperate, and boreal regions, as well as in developed and developing countries. Several institutional processes are in place to develop criteria for and indicators of sustainable forestry. As customers and consumers have become more knowledgeable, they are becoming more demanding about the environmental attributes of the products they buy. Forest products companies and forest landowners who wish to maintain access to these more demanding markets will need to provide assurances of their commitment to sustainable forestry practices.
   Forest landowners and forest products manufacturers in Washington, Oregon, and California are currently better positioned to meet these expectations than are producers in other regions. In these western states, state forest practices laws and regulations are generally consistent with emerging international criteria and indicators of sustainable management.
   However, U.S. competitors in such countries as Canada and Sweden are acting rapidly to establish sustainable forestry practices, and to communicate their commitments to their stakeholders and customers. The assurance of sustainable forestry practices is now the latest means by which environmentally aware and demanding customers and consumers differentiate among forest products producers.

AB This paper describes current initiatives to develop a lake management plan for Lake Taupo, New Zealand. Recently there has been an indication that a shift from dry stock farming to large-scale dairy farming will occur in the Taupo catchment. The local community has expressed an interest in this shift towards more intensive land use. There is public concern regarding the current state of Lake Taupo's water quality and the ability to maintain environmental quality in the face of increasing development pressures. Concerns about rising levels of nutrients in the lake are supported by trend analysis of lake water quality monitoring data. The Taupo District Council and the Waikato Regional Council have proposed development of a Lake Taupo Management Plan. A number of mechanisms for achieving this process could be explored. These include a plan largely developed by an inter-agency management group or a more public participatory approach directly involving the community. A general lake planning framework is described and some of the limitations of the process explored. Comparison with experiences at Lake Rotorua, New Zealand, and Lake Tahoe, United States of America, supports a pre-cautionary approach to the use of predictive ecological models in policy development. The inability of aquatic ecological theory to conform to quantitative approaches in other physical sciences needs to be acknowledged by scientists and conveyed to the public. Until the link between land-use practice and water quality is better understood, a pre-cautionary approach to catchment development at Lake Taupo should be encouraged. One cannot assume that common desires for both environmental protectionism, and progressive intensification of land use, will lead to sustainable resource management. The environmental effects of dairy farming indicate that encouraging this land-use practice will not lead to the desired community expectation of water quality protection at Lake Taupo.

AB Over the past decade there has been a growing interest in occupational health as a result of some high profile legal cases, the growth of research into the psychological contract and the need to invest in people's health and development. In this article a personal viewpoint is expressed that if occupational health physicians or psychologists are to make an effective contribution to the long-term business success of their employers then they must adopt a strategic approach to their work. They ought to be able to do this and still maintain their clinical autonomy and protect the interests of their employee clients. The need for partnerships between bodies representing clinicians, managers and government agencies is also explored, taking into consideration the government's green paper Our Healthier Nation.

AB The objective of this study was to evaluate the dry matter yields of Calopogonium mucunoides, Stizolobium aterrimum, Stizolobium deeringeanum variety "rajada", Canavalia ensiformis, Cajanus cajan, Crotalaria breviflora and C. spectabilis in relation to the sowing densities of 10, 20, 40, 80 and 160 seeds m(-2), and the yield of weeds grown in these legume densities. This study was carried out from May to August 1996, in a coastal tableland area of the Antonio Martins Experimental Station (EMDAGRO/Embrapa-CPATC), at Lagarto, State of Sergipe, Brazil. The number of survival plants and the dry matter yields were determined when each species reached the flowering stage. The highest increments of dry matter yield in response to increasing levels of sowing density were observed in plants of Crotalarin spectabilis and C. breviflora followed by C, mucunoides, S. aterrimum and S. deeringeanum. A negative response to the increasing sowing densities was observed in Canavalia ensiformis and sowing densities did not affect the dry matter yield of Cajanus cajan plants. Linear and positive responses of C. spectabilis, C. breviflora and C, mucunoides, and quadratic responses of C. ensiformis, C. cajan and S. deeringeanum were obtained for number of plants in response to increasing sowing density. No equations were found to express the relation between the number of survival plants and sowing densities of S. aterrimum, but the survival of this species at high populations was very low. S. aterrimum and C. ensiformis showed the best weed inhibition, even in the lower sowing densities.

AB Individuals within a species, living across a wide range of habitats, often display a great deal of phenotypic plasticity for organ mass and function. We investigated the extent to which changes in organ mass are variable, corresponding to environmental demand, across an altitudinal gradient. Are there changes in the mass of oxygen delivery organs (heart and lungs) and other central processing organs (gut, liver, kidney) associated with an increased sustainable metabolic rate that results from decreased ambient temperatures and decreased oxygen availability along an altitudinal gradient? We measured food intake, resting metabolic rate (RMR), and organ mass in captive deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus bairdii) at three sites from 1,200 to 3,800 m above sea level to determine whether energy demand was correlated with organ mass. We found that food intake, gut mass, and cardiopulmonary organ mass increased in mice living at high altitudes. RMR was not correlated with organ mass differences along the altitudinal gradient. While the conditions in this study were by no means extreme, these results show that mice living at high altitudes have higher levels of energy demand and possess larger cardiopulmonary and digestive organs than mice living at lower altitudes.

AB Nitrogen (N) fertilizer applied in the NH4+ form results in some degree of soil acidification, which could influence nutrient availability to plants and nutrient losses through leaching. Effects of various N rates (0-168 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) on soil acidification and nutrient availability were investigated in a Riviera fine sand with 26-year-old white Marsh grapefruit (Citrus paradisi MacFadyen) trees. Soil pH significantly decreased with increasing NH4-N rates. Application of 112 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) for four years decreased the pH by 0.7 to 1.7 unit. Soil acidification was greater when the NH4+ form of N fertilizer was applied as dry soluble granular material compared to fertigation or controlled release forms. The marked effect of NH4-N fertilization on the pH of the Riviera fine sand was due to its low buffering capacity. Soil acidification increased the concentration of extractable Fe and P but decreased that of K, Zn and Mn. Soil pH was positively correlated with concentration of Ca, but negatively with concentrations of Fe, Mn and Zn in six-month-old spring flush leaves of the grapefruit trees. Leaf P concentrations, however, were poorly correlated with soil pH. This study also demonstrated an increase in leaching of P and K below the grapefruit trees rootzone with a decrease in soil pH.

ID JAPAN
AB The global environmental consequences of CO, discharge resulting from energy use are causing increasing concern regarding the sustainability of our development future. Despite the fragile nature of its energy structure, Japan successfully overcame two energy crises in the 1970s and managed to maintain economic growth which resulted in a dramatic improvement in its industrial technology. The success of these efforts can be attributed to the substitution of an unconstrained production factor (technology) for a constrained production factor (energy), a process similar to that seen in an ecosystem. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry's (MITI) industrial technology policy functioned well in stimulating such substitution, thereby inducing the vitality of industry for this substitution. Given the two-sided nature of CO, emissions and energy consumption, Japan's experience can provide informative suggestions for addressing current worldwide concern regarding global warming, particularly with respect to post Kyoto countermeasures. Nevertheless, following the relaxation of energy constraints and the succeeding 'bubble economy' and its bursting, MITI's ability to induce substitution efforts by industry has weakened, leading to a fear that Japan may again face the prospect of energy and environmental constraints. This paper attempts to analyze a systems option for sustainable development by introducing a comprehensive systems approach with a detailed description of energy and non-energy technologies in an energy-economic model. By utilizing this approach, MITI's efforts to induce industry initiatives, and subsequent efforts to overcome the two energy crises by substituting technology for energy are reviewed. In addition, sources of the current fear concerning energy and environmental constraints and the effectiveness of MITI's industrial technology policy in view of this fear are analyzed.

AB The issues surrounding mineral development have changed dramatically within the last decade and the changes associated with dealing with the social and cultural issues surrounding mineral development have seen the greatest change. The result of all of these changes is a "New Reality of Mineral Development" which requires that mineral development be a partnership alliance of industry, government (national and local), Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs; national and international) and indigenous peoples, working within the broader context of international treaties and norms, to insure that the exploitation of a nation's resources contributes to sustainable development. Central to achieving the partnership alliance and sustainable development is the requirement that the traditional government-industry alliance of the past becomes an equal partner government-industry-indigenous people NGO alliance for the future: which requires major changes in the philosophy and actions of all participants.

TI The edible plant Dichelostemma capitatum: Its vegetative reproduction
   response to different indigenous harvesting regimes in California
SO RESTORATION ECOLOGY

ID SUCCESSION; COMMUNITIES
AB To more thoroughly understand the ecological effects of harvesting geophytes for food by American Indians, an investigation of the ethnobotany and population dynamics of Dichelostemma capitatum (blue dicks), an attractive source of nutrition to many California Indian groups was undertaken. Some cultural groups harvest the corms and replant the cormlets, spare plants, and harvest after seeding to ensure replenishment of seed. Some Indian elders equate judicious harvesting with the maintenance and enhancement of field populations of this geophyte. A field experiment was conducted to determine the degree to which differences in intensity and timing of harvest, with and without replanting of cormlets, have any effect on corm and cormlet production. We found that harvesting at 100% intensity, through digging up all plants and corms, and without replanting cormlets at the seed stage, significantly reduces numbers of corms and cormlets compared to the controls (no harvest). However, harvesting at 50% intensity, through digging up half of all plants and corms at the flowering or seed stages, without replanting cormlets, was not significantly different from the controls (no harvest). The results suggest that harvesting blue dicks corms with a digging stick in the latter way could yield a sustainable level of harvest. Indigenous harvesting and management regimes may offer some of the best examples of long-term uses and management of the regional flora without detriment to its biodiversity. Restorationists are urged to study and experimentally mimic indigenous disturbance regimes and their ecological effects known to occur historically in various ecosystems. In some cases, areas will greatly benefit from the reintroduction of management and harvesting regimes that authentically simulate ancient indigenous interactions.

AB The aim of this study was to identify factors associated with sustainable behaviour change among persons at increased risk for future cardiovascular disease. A qualitative approach based on focus group interviews was used. Twenty-five men aged 62-71 years who participated in the Oslo Study Diet and Anti-smoking Trial were interviewed in four focus groups. The study identified five categories of factors linked to the process of lifestyle changes: the doctor-patient relationship, significant others, motivators, barriers, and empowerment. A strong personal attachment to the principal investigator of the Oslo Study was revealed. The relationship was described as friendly and supportive, The family based approach and the impact of spouses, in particular, was emphasized by the participants. Somatic symptoms and fear often acted as motivators to behavioural change. Individual feedback was also identified as an important motivator, Psychological resistance to external pressure, concerns regarding behaviour change, and benefits from current (unhealthy) behaviour were identified as barriers. Participants reported a process of empowerment and personal control as an important element of sustainable change. The importance of the unique relationship with a certain provider has implications for future healthcare planning. This factor may also limit the external validity of studies of human behaviour.

AB As constituted today, the transport sector is not sustainable in the long-term. It is based almost entirely on non-replenishable natural resources which, when combusted, release emissions that can cause serious harm to human beings, animals and the natural environment. Therefore, in order to achieve a sustainable transport system, it is imperative to achieve a means of propulsion, which is based on renewable energy sources in every phase of production and distribution. The responsibility for developing such a sustainable transport system is an assignment, which must be approached as a common cause, involving both the official agencies of society and the business sector together with international cooperation. In 1991 the Swedish Government allocated 120 million Swedish crowns to the Swedish Transport and Communications Research Board (KFB) as funds for research, development and demonstration in the field of biofuels to be used in the transportation sector. In order to fulfil this obligation a program was presented and approved and this program for engine alcohols and biogas was carried out between the summer of 1991 and the end of 1997. The program has generated a broad spectrum of useful results showing that, in general terms, there are a number of technical problems connected to the use of biofuels. There is also a need to continue the development of both the fuels and the engines in order to take advantage of all that can be achieved concerning the use of biofuels in the transportation sector. The presentation at The Sixth International Highway and Urban Pollution Symposium will focus on a brief description of the program carried out and a presentation of the results of the field tests and the emission characterisation.

TI Global sustainability and the creative destruction of industries
SO SLOAN MANAGEMENT REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
ID INNOVATION; FAILURE; FIRMS
AB Most large corporations developed in an era of abundant raw materials, cheap energy, and limitless sinks for waste disposal. It has become increasingly clear that many technologies developed during this earlier peiod contribute to the destruction of the ecological systems on which the global economy depends. In the absence of dramatic change, few would dispute that the world is destined to devolve toward environmental degradation, social upheaval, and mass migratron.
   Hart and Milstein argue; that the emerging challenge of global sustainability will catalyze a new round of "creative destruction" that innovators and entrepreneurs will view as one of the biggest business opportunities in the history of commerce. In this article, the authors propose a framework to help managers look beyond continuous, incremental improvement of existing products and processes to see the business world differently and make sustainable opportunities more apparent.
   To better understand sustainability-driven creative destruction, managers must evaluate business opportunities on the basis of three types of markets or economies that exist in all countries or geographical regions: developed(nearly 1 billion global customers), emerging (estimated at roughly 2 billion people), and surviving (roughly half of humanity or 3 billion customers). The authors discuss the different strategies required to achieve sustainable development in each economy.
   To compete in the consumer economy, managers must focus on reducing the life-cycle ("cradle to grave") impacts - that is, the "ecological footprint" of their firms' activities - by reinventing their products and processes. The combination of large footprint and technological maturity widens the gap between price and life-cycle cost, producing the technological and environmental forces that drive creative destruction.
   Because it is unlikely that senior managers will commit resources without a clear understanding of how sustainability-driven creative destruction can improve a firm's economic payoff, the authors offer ideas for sustainability metrics tied to the three economies discussed and show how they relate to key business and financial payoffs.
   Managers who treat sustainable development as an opportunity will drive the creative destruction process and build the foundation to compete in the twenty-first century.

AB Research projects for malaria control must involve communities to elicit strategies to be successful and programs to be sustainable. Therefore, knowledge, beliefs and practices of the population concerned must be taken into account in the design of interventions against malaria transmission. We conducted a KAP study in Buenaventura, a port on the Pacific Coast of Colombia where transmission was on the increase at the beginning of this decade. The purpose of the study was to help in the design and implementation of a primary health care approach for malaria control. Both qualitative and quantitative research methods were used. The focus group technique was applied in five urban and peri-urban communities and a cross sectional survey was conducted on a random sample of 1380 subjects with a structured interview on knowledge, practices and also on demographic and epidemiological aspects. The information obtained by the two methods was comparable on knowledge of symptoms, causes and ways of malaria transmission, and prevention practices like the use of bednets or provision of health services. We discuss the relevance of obtaining this information and analyze the elements that must be taken into account for communities to become more involved in malaria control strategies.

ID TRAGEDY
AB The question of how to organize the sustainable exploitation of common-pool resources (CPRs) is an important issue on a global environmental agenda. We argue that the current approach to collective action in CPR management has a number of shortcomings I elated to (I) the focus on single-use CPRs and (2) the formulation of a priori design principles for successful collective action, which hinders rather than facilitates CPR research and policies. We propose a social constructivist perspective for the study of CPRs, and discuss its implications for research and policy programs. This approach studies the CPR as an entity within a wider external environment, focusing on resource users' motivations for certain action strategies. The outcome of collective management is considered to be the result of interactions between stakeholders and nonhuman entities, which depends on the way social actors "socially construct" their everyday, reality. A case study of Irish fishermen, who felt alienated from their fishery as a result of the expansion of commercial finfish farms, and who created common property rights to secure access to the fishery,forms the empirical basis for this study.

AB Genetic engineering is placed in the context of a history of transformations of the relations between 'cultivated nature' and 'naturally occurring nature'. It is argued that genetic modification is a bio-socio-economic process, producing new diversity within cultivated nature. Viewing bio-science and technology as 'socially embedded', it argues that different trajectories of their development have both the much trumpeted negative possibilities of ecological disaster and a positive potential of revolutionising both the culture of food and eco-sustainability.

AB The theoretical domain developed for the study of New Social Movements (NSMs) in the early 1980s has recently been largely abandoned by its main advocates. Increasingly, the cross-class, 'post-materialist' movements of the 1970s and 1980s, typified by the issues of environment, peace and feminism, cease to pose a radical challenge to contemporary western politics. This paper revisits the theoretical work of three of the European voices central to understandings of the emergence and success of New Social Movements. Claus Offe, Alberto Melucci and Alain Touraine succeed in amalgamating an essential emphasis on structural transformation and an understanding of the importance of identity in bringing about 'new' collective action in the 1970s and 1980s. In response, to the significant decrease in European work on the NSM phenomenon today the paper proposes that the existing body of theory may be insufficient for describing collective action at the turn of the Millennium. The increasing predominance of 'identity' politics (e.g. in the realms of ethnicity and sexuality) in the arenas previously dominated by 'universalist', post-particularist themes; the institutionalisation of elements of NSM action and concerns; and the perceived appropriation by transnational agencies of the issues dominating original state-NSM struggles are cited as reasons for the need to develop a new language to describe contemporary collective action phenomena.

AB The potential of planted leguminous cover crop fallow as an alternative to the natural regrowth fallow for sustaining the productivity of low activity clay (LAC) soils in the tropics as the fallow period shortens was tested at Ibadan in the forest-savanna zone of southwestern Nigeria. The study, initiated in 1990, compared an improved system (cover crop-fallow) and a traditional system (natural fallow), with the aim of developing an improved cover crop-fallow system for sustainable management of LAC soils of the tropics. Pueuraria phaseoloides, an herbaceous, N-fixing, perennial legume with a slow initial growth habit, was selected as a test cover crop. Pueraria was sown with a maize-cassava intercrop at the same season. In a 2-year cycle, 1 year of cropping was followed by 1 year fallow with pueraria fdr the cover crop-fallow system or with natural regrowth (mainly Chromolaena odorata) for the natural fallow system. Maize-cassava intercropping without a fallow period (continuous cropping) was included as a control. No fertilizer was applied throughout the experimental period. Pueraria produced 253 kg N ha(-1) after the fallow period, compared with 109 kg N ha(-1) for chromolaena; pueraria was also better in recycling P (11 kg P ha(-1)) than was chromolaena (9 kg P ha(-1)), Natural fallow for 1 year increased the maize yield from 75 to 350% from 1992 to 1996, and the cassava yield from 9 to 130% compared with continuous cropping. Cover crop-fallow resulted in a 22 to 72% higher maize yield than the natural fallow from 1992 to 1996. Although in 1992 and 1994 cassava tuber yield was lower with the cover crop-fallow than with the natural fallow, with better pueraria husbandry in 1996, cover crop-fallow increased the cassava tuber yield by 41%. With residue burning, the N balance was 27 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) for the pueraria cover crop-fallow system and -15 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) for the chromolaena natural fallow system. Cover crop-fallow maintained soil organic carbon status better than the natural fallow. Integration of a pueraria legume cover crop did not affect soil pH. Results indicate cover crop-fallow with pueraria could be a better alternative to traditional natural fallow under shortened fallow periods for raising or maintaining productivity of LAC soils of the humid tropics.

AB Soil C and N greatly influence Long-term sustainability of agricultural systems, We hypothesized that cropping and tillage differentially influence dryland soil C and N characteristics in the Southern High Plains. A Pullman clay loam (fine, mixed, thermic Torrertic Paleustol) cropped to vc heat (Triticum aestivum L.)-sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L) Moench]-fallow (WSF), continuous wheat (CW) and continuous sorghum (CS) under no-tillage (NT), and stubble mulch (SM) was sampled at three depths to determine soil C and N characteristics. For CW, CS, and WSF phases (F-WSF, S-WSF, W-WSF), soil organic C (SOC) averaged 10.6 to 13.1 kg m(-3) and was greatest for CW, Carbon mineralization (C-MIN) at 0 to 20 mm was 30 to 40% greater for CW and F-WSF than for CS, S-WSF, or W-WSF. Cropping system by depth influenced soil organic N (SON),vith greatest SON at 0 to 20 mm in CW (1.5 kg m(-3)). At 0 to 20 mm for SM and NT, SOC was 9.9 and 12.5 kg m(-3), soil microbial biomass C (SMBC) was 0.80 and 1.1 kg m(-3), and soil microbial biomass N (SMBN) was 0.14 and 0.11 kg m(-3). Also at 0 to 20 mm, NT had 60% greater C-MIN, 11% more SMBC as a portion SOC, and 25% more SON compared to SM. Summed for 0 to 80 mm, NT had more SOC (0.98 vs 0.85 kg m(-2)) and SON (0.10 vs 0.9 kg m(-2)) than SM, and CW had greater or equal C and N activity as other systems. Negative correlations between yield and SOC, SMBC, C-MIN, SON, and SMBN indicate N removal in grain negatively affects active and labile C and N pools. Under dryland conditions, C and N conservation is greater with NT and with winter wheat because of less soil disturbance and shorter fallow.

TI Erosion and productivity of vegetable systems on sloping volcanic
   ash-derived Philippine soils
SO SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
ID SOUTHEAST-ASIA; LAND; MALAYSIA; UPLANDS; CARBON; WATER
AB Soil erosion is a major constraint to the sustainability of sloping-land vegetable systems. Little information is available on the effectiveness of soil conservation measures under sloping intensified vegetable systems on volcanic ash-derived soils. We hypothesized that contouring, strip cropping, and high-value contour hedgerows - asparagus (Asparagus officinalis L.), pineapple [Ananas comosus (L.) Merr.], pigeonpea [Cajanus cajan (L,) Huth], and lemongrass [Cymbopogon flexuosus (Nees ex Steudel) J. F. Watson] - reduce soil loss compared with the farmer's traditional practice of up-and-down cultivation on sloping lands. A field experiment tested these soil conservation technologies from 1995 to 1998 in a completely randomized block design on a 42% natural slope on a clayey, halloysitic, isothermic, Typic Kandiudox, The greatest annual soil loss (65.3 t ha(-1)) was in the up-and-down system and comparative values were 37.8 t ha(-1) for contouring, 43.7 t ha(-1) for strip cropping, and 45.4 t ha(-1) for high-value contour hedgerows. Three rain events alone caused 47% of the total soil loss. All erosion-runoff plots showed large differences in soil properties and crop yields between the upper and the lower slope. Crop yields downslope were greater by 40% for tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Miller), 36% for corn (Zea mays L.), and 78% for cabbage (Brassica oleracea var, capitata L.) than for upslope. In the contour hedgerow treatment, rapid terrace development changed soil properties, and crop yields for the bottom portions of bioterraces were greater by 121% for corn and 50% for tomato than yields of top portions.

AB Historically, societies have been abandoned when management invoked complicated infrastructure that diminished returns on effort. Some societies survived by redefining their relationship to the resource base through emergence of a new, more elaborate level of organization. Organization may elaborate when resources are expanded or used more efficiently. The new situation favorably resets the cost/benefit ratio of problem solving. With six billion people, our critical problem is the capture of natural resources while maintaining ecosystem function to keep them renewable. Presently resource management is too complicated at too low a level, and suffers diminishing returns. Supply-side sustainability recommends management from the context for the function of the whole ecosystem, not the resource. Then ecosystems integrate materials and energy sustainability, while generating resources that humans can take. To achieve a global level of organization of resource management we see a new relationship between the feedback of commerce, greened by the social and environmental resource sciences in the academy, with governmental catalysis.

AB This paper shows how systems science can clarify the debate and outline the basic differences between technology and sustainability. Deconstruction is a process by which the various meanings of a concept are ascertained. It is used to draw the characteristics of technology and sustainability. Each of these two concepts is driven by imperatives which are in conflict with each other. The discussion infers how they can be reconciled. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB With the end of the Cold War, private property free enterprise has emerged as the dominant economic model, its hallmark the rapid spread of capital markets worldwide. Institutionalized capital is fast becoming the dominant means by which that capital is held. This detached form of capitalism has combined with concentrated personal ownership to create a form of free enterprise that is often insensitive to the concerns of people and communities whose Lives its operations affect. The result is to endanger sustainability across five overlapping domains: fiscal, constitutional, civil, social and environmental. Today's dumbed-down capitalism requires a policy environment capable of fostering ownership patterns that include a component of people-ized, localized and human-sized ownership.

DT Article
DE business; sustainable; feedback; innovation; efficiency; design
AB Since the 1960s, business and environmental advocates have battled over how to apportion nature's resources. Should they be used to drive business growth, or protected to safeguard the environment? There is an alternative to this win-lose approach: the application of systems principles to business and management. By taking a systems approach to business and environment, conflict can be resolved to the benefit of both.
   One key is to consider business as a system. A growing number of chief executives are viewing their companies in this way, not just as an environmental step, but as a strategy for enhancing total business performance. The result is not only a reduction in environmental impacts, but an increase in profits and performance as well.
   Bill Coors of Coors Brewing believes that the businesses of the past were structured like machines, according to a linear 'open loop' model that wasted resources, taking them from nature, cycling them through the economy, and discarding them into air, water, and land. This old business model is much like the food chain once emphasized in biology. Coors developed his company, Coors Brewing, using a 'closed loop' model that more closely resembles a food web. In this model, feedback loops transmit environmental costs back to the company, triggering innovations that not only reduce waste, but also trigger new profit centers. Coors used his insights to leverage a traditional industrial business-a mass-market brewery-into a diverse high-technology spin-off, ACX Technologies, whose profits are based more on design than on the consumption of resources.
   Gordon Moore, cofounder of Intel, has taken this concept a step further. In Moore's view, by applying the concept of value by design, microchips and other products can be created that provide even greater economic value using even fewer resources. The microchip is his example. It is made of simple, abundant materials, which serve as a platform for design. The chip's value is a function of the design inscribed on it, not the resources in it. Based on this,'Moore's law' suggests that the number of transistors on a microchip will double every 2 years.
   Moore's law suggests an even more promising opportunity: that throughout the economy businesses of all types can create huge increases in economic value, while consuming fewer physical resources. They can profit not by consumption, but by design. Tachi Kiuchi, founding CEO of Mitsubishi Electric America, believes that resource efficiency can be boosted by a factor of four or more, if businesses can be structured not like machines, but Like living systems. He suggests principles and practices through which businesses can become 'as creative and innovative as the rainforest'. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Nutrients in manure constitute an ecological and economic liability if managed as a waste for disposal. However nutrients are the source of economic benefit when managed as a resource. By combining economic and ecological analyses, the ecological benefits of nutrients in manure are conserved, their economic value is captured, and both ecological and economic goals can be met. We derived a simple model to define the conditions required for manure to be recycled effectively and transported economically The basic premise of the model is that ecological and economic considerations must be in balance at steady state for manure nutrient management to be sustainable. The model combines the cost of processing and transportation, the value of the crop yield response to the manure product and the steady state capacity of the land to recycle macronutrients. The model predicts that processing, to increase macronutrient content or to decrease unit transportation cost, and use of manure products on high value crops could permit break-even distribution distances for same manure products of more than 300 km. We then used estimates of manure and crop production in Alberta to calculate municipal N and P balances to determine the distance of distribution required to use manure effectively (municipality as used here is analogous to county in many parts of the world). In 1991, municipalities with manure nutrients in excess of that harvested as grain were adjacent to municipalities with nutrient deficits. We conclude that (1) equating ecological and economic aspects of manure distribution is feasible and may enhance the profitability of agriculture, and (2) improved effectiveness in the use of manure resources may be achieved by nutrient conservation and harvesting, processing to increase nutrient retention and reduce transport costs, and application technologies to increase crop response to nutrients in manure products.

TI A global review of energy use in urban transport systems and its
   implications for urban transport and land-use policy
SO TRANSPORTATION QUARTERLY
LA English
DT Article
AB The use of energy in urban transport systems is a critical dimension in the sustainability of cities. And, as the 21st century approaches, more attention is being placed on this issue because of the problematic global outlook for traditional oil supplies, and the effect that the burning of fossil fuels has on greenhouse gas emissions.
   Automobile cities, such as those in the United States, use eight times more energy per capita in private passenger transport systems than in more public transport-oriented Asian cities. These patterns can be traced to population trends in metropolitan regions and the various transport factors that flow from low-density, heavily zoned suburban-based cities compared to high-density, mixed land-use cities such as those in Asia, especially Hong Kong. Energy-use patterns cannot be defined in terms of a city's wealth, as is often claimed. Public transport energy use per capita represents a tiny fraction of that in private transport, even where public transport plays the major role in a city's transport system. Public transport offers huge savings in energy use and reduces greenhouse gas emissions. Some policy implications, in terms of urban land-use change and transport infrastructure priorities, can further reduce energy use in transport and offer cities other positive outcomes for livability and sustainability.

TI Transformation of transport policy in Great Britain
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE
LA English
DT Article
DE British transport policy; traffic; restraint; road pricing;
   sustainability
AB The British Government recently issued a white paper on its future transport strategy. Its central precept is unambiguous. current trends in traffic are unsustainable, from the point of view of the environment, business efficiency, health, and the unfeasibility of providing growth in road capacity that would keep pace with predicted growth in traffic. Much of the policy logic in the white paper stems from the explicit abandonment of predict- and-provide' as a desirable - or possible - strategy. This leads to a recognition of the importance of a co-ordinated approach to public transport, walking and cycling, together with policies aimed at reducing less necessary travel where possible; ensuring that the costs of congestion and environmental pollution are, as far as practical, met by those who cause them (in which the revenue from new pricing systems would be kept under local control and used for transport improvements); an emphasis on better maintenance and management of the road system rather than increasing its capacity; consideration of the effects on transport of other policies in land-use, health, education etc; development of institutional structures or contractual arrangements able to bring these changes about; and conditions in which people's everyday behaviour and attitudes may be in harmony with policy, finance and environmental constraints. These themes did not arise out of the blue following the general election in 1997. They evolved over many years, especially in nearly ten years of intense discussion connected with the previous two governments' recognition that the 1989 road programme ('Roads to Prosperity'), in spite of its size and expense, would still not be nearly sufficient to keep pace with traffic growth, as well as being environmentally damaging. The process of discussion and argument has not ceased with publication of the white paper. A very interesting feature of the current debate is that its central argument is widely (though not unanimously) accepted in the media, with great emphasis on the problems of implementation. The author argues that the policy shift is genuine and firmly grounded in research, though with a number of real problems in implementation, research and methodology that will have to be addressed.

AB Modern agricultural practices require the massive application of fertilizer to soils worldwide. In the USA alone, millions of tons of fertilizer are applied to agricultural soils each year. The adverse environmental impact and high cost of fertilizer use underscore the importance of improving the capability of plants to capture nutrients from soil. Therefore, engineering plants with improved micronutrient uptake may help in creating sustainable agriculture in the next century.

AB The majority of soils in Africa are P-deficient, bur the high cost of conventional, water-soluble P fertilisers limits their use by resource-poor farmers. Rockphosphates are a low-cost alternative. The relative agronomic effectiveness of unacidulated (RP), 25% partially acidulated (PARP25), 50% partially acidulated (PARP50) Minjingu rockphosphate and triple superphosphate (TSP) was evaluated at rates of 0-80 kg/ha P on style (Stylosanthes guianensis) on an Ultisol in the Ethiopian highlands. The fertilisers were applied once and their effects were followed for 4 consecutive harvests. Style dry matter (DM) yields were below 3 t/ha at each cut without applied P and reached as high as 4.8 t/ha when P was applied. Over all 4 cuts, RP was 100%, PARP25 was 89% and PARP50 was 103% as effective as TSP in increasing style herbage yields. The corresponding relative responses in P uptake were 103, 79 and 92% for RP, PARP25 and PARP50, respectively. The substitution rates for herbage yields were 100% for RP, 79% for PARP25 and 106% for PARP50 while those for P uptake were 106% for RP, 62% for PARP25 and 85% for PARP50. Significant (P < 0.05) effects of P on style DM and P uptake were observed at all harvests. It is concluded that raw Minjingu rockphosphate is highly effective on style in these soils. This rockphosphate could be used to increase forage production for increased and sustainable crop-livestock productivity on the P-deficient Ultisols.

AB Theileria parva is the causative agent of three epidemiologically different diseases, East Coast fever (ECF), Corridor disease and January disease, caused by 3 types of T, parva, T. p. parva, T. p. lawrencei and T. p. bovis, respectively. The history of immunization against these diseases has been marked by salient discoveries such as the immune status in recovered animals, the activity of tetracyclines during the incubation period, the possibility for cryopreserving supernatant of prefed ticks and the development of useful serological tests. The possibility of simultaneous administration of stabilate and lone-acting tetracycline have greatly contributed to making the infection and treatment method operational. The importance of antigenic diversity in T. parva has been reflected in the difficulties related to the selection of the immunizing stock or combinations of stocks: a 'cocktail' of East African isolates may give broad protection against field challenge by ECF (T. parva parva), but Corridor disease is more problematic. On the other hand, certain single isolates may give equally good protection against ECF field challenge. Studies on the immunology of T, parva infection and the application of molecular tools have led to the discovery that sera of recovered animals neutralize sporozoites-of various isolates, and to the p67 molecular vaccine; yet so far the only available method of immunizing against T. parva infections is the infection and treatment method or, in the case of T. parva bovis, the use of sublethal stabilate doses. Infection and treatment is applied on a fairly large scale in Zambia. and on a more limited scale in a few other countries. Immunity by this rather crude method is longlasting and solid, but cross-immunity problems against some field strains remain. Furthermore, as immunized animals remain carriers, immunization may contribute to attaining and improving endemic stability in endemic areas in indigenous breeds with an adequate level of genetic tolerance to ECF. On the other hand, carrier animals may constitute a risk for spreading the disease into ECF-free areas where the vector is present. Other disadvantages of the method are chat immunization of cattle during the incubation of naturally contracted East Coast fever will not prevent the disease and jeopardize its reputation. Furthermore, stabilates have to be cryopreserved, often a technical drawback, and contamination with undesirable pathogens may occur in rick-derived material. Therefore the need remains for the development of effective molecular vaccines and it must be remembered that immunization must be cost-effective and sustainable and it is only one aspect of integrated control of theileriosis and other tick-borne diseases. There is no universally valid strategy Several factors have to be considered: value and susceptibility of cattle to theileriosis and to other tick-borne and rick-associated diseases, infestation by various ticks present in the area, the type: of theileriosis (ECF, Corridor disease or January disease) and the epidemiological situation where immunization is taking place. The optimal age for immunization of the calves in endemic areas needs to be determined: when calf mortality by naturally occurring theileriosis is a problem, the sooner calves are immunized the better, but a proportion will have contracted natural infection before they can be reached, and immunization of very young calves might not be fully effective.

AB Water is vital for the survival and development of every community or society. The health of a given community is reflected to a large extent in the water quality of the community's available water resources. In Ghana, efforts have been made since colonial clays to supply both the urban and the rural communities with potable water to enhance the rapid socio-economic development of the country. It is economically viable due to the remoteness of most of the rural communities to supply them with potable water from local sources such as groundwater. The urban water supply systems are mainly based on surface water sources. With the ever-expanding population, there is a need to improve freshwater resources conservation and management in order to avoid impending shortages. To ensure the total coverage of all rural and ur ban communities by the year 2020, a huge capital outlay of $1 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively, is needed Most of these funds are expected to come from the private sector, both local and foreign, with the Government making some substantial contribution.

TI Maternal effects on development and performance of young rabbits
SO ZUCHTUNGSKUNDE
LA German
DT Article
AB A total of 775 fattening rabbits out of 90 litters from Zika-hybrid does were used to quantify pre- and postnatal maternal effects on growth performance df the kids. Half of the does tested were young does with their first litter and old does with more than two litters respectively. By applying a complete kid exchange and assigning eight kids per nursing doe, the effect of prenatal performance of the doe (kids' body weight at birth) separated from the postnatal performance of the nursing doe (milk performance) on the development of the kids were quantified. Primipara does had a lower milk production and their kids showed lower weight at birth compared to old does. The most pronounced differentiation was observed between kids from young and old nursing does during the first three weeks of life. This was due to the different availability of milk as the only nutritional source for the kids. Birth weight of the kids as influenced by the age of the doe significantly affects the 3-week-body weight thereafter independent of the milk available. The differences due to the age of the mother resp, nursing doe in daily gain of the kids became smaller in the course of the development. Age of the mother (kid's weight at birth) as well as age of the nursing doe (milk performance) influenced the 12-week-body weight of the kids significantly. Considering 12-week-body weight and the composition of the carcass (carcass cuts) prenatal maternal effects tended to be more sustainable and pronounced compared to postnatal maternal effects. The distinct difference in body weight of the kids at the early stage, due to differences in milk performance of the nursing does, was only partly compensated for up to the end of the fattening period.

AB The Manila Bay coastal area in The Philippines was evaluated for the possible consequences of accelerated sea level rise in the context of climate change and to assess adaptive responses to such threats. The coastal area is an important region in terms of commercial, industrial, agricultural, and aquacultural activities of The Philippines. Results show that areas along the coast if inundated by a 1 m sea level rise would include coastal barangays from 19 municipalities of Metro Manila, Bulacan, and Cavite and would cover an area of 5555 ha. Proposed response strategies consist of protecting the coast by building sea walls; institutional actions such as formulation of setback policies and construction regulations; and adaptive planning in the context of an integrated coastal zone management to address the short- and long-term problems, with the involvement of communities in the area. Information, education, and communication are essential along with the technical and scientific efforts to achieve a well-balanced adaptation plan.

TI Automatic generation of dynamic clamping forces for machining fixtures
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID WORKPIECE
AB Automatic fixture configuration analysis is an essential issue in the context of computer-integrated manufacturing. In this paper, a general methodology for fixture configuration verification is presented, which is based on force closure and clamping equilibrium. The inclusion of a new clamping equilibrium criterion ensures a robust clamping layout and hence reduces the possibility of workpiece displacement within a fixture. For clamping force analysis, a new method for directly generating the minimal clamping intensity for planar fixtures is presented. Next, we develop a general friction methodology of dynamic clamping analysis and planning for arbitrary-shaped workpieces based on nonlinear programming. The objective of the presented algorithm is to determine a spectrum of minimum sustainable clamping forces for a machining process based on a proposed criterion of maximum friction. The set of variable clamping intensities is determined such that it is just enough to counterbalance the dynamic cutting forces. This approach is more realistic than other systems with static cutting conditions and frictionless contacts. The concept of maximum clamping forces is also proposed and a computation method is presented. The non-approximation representation of contacting forces presented in this algorithm guarantees the existence of an optimal clamping solution. Moreover, it makes the algorithm robust and reliable. Case studies are included to demonstrate the effectiveness and capabilities of the methodology.

AB This study presents for the first time in the Indian context a consistent set of annual macro-economic data from 1950-51 to 1997-98 by integrating the national accounts statistics of the CSO with the balance of payments and the monetary data of the RBI as well as with the fiscal data of the government of India. Despite certain minor problems of definitions and measurements left unresolved by this exercise, the resulting integration helped us to detect the structural changes that have occurred in the real and financial sectors of the Indian economy over the entire sample period, in general, and between the pre- and post-liberalisation phases, in particular. In such a context we have identified many important empirical patterns and regularities, notably the existence of business cycles, the counter-cyclical nature of inflation, the cyclical variations in income distribution, the twin deficits problem, the impact of absorption on reserves, the evolution of the debt-income ratio, the relationship between real interest rates and growth, the sustainability of the fiscal stance, amongst others, which could act as theoretical guideposts for the formulation of issues in the role and conduct of macro-economic stabilisation policy. In this first part, we use a consistency accounting matrix which specifies the linkages between sources and uses of funds as well as between institutional sector accounts. It is seen that the resulting framework ensures the numerical consistency of data drawn from different sources in such a way that both the sectoral budget constraints as well as the overall economy wide budget constraints are simultaneously satisfied.

AB Sustainability of tropical pastures has various economic and biophysical dimensions and is affected by species composition, age and management. The sustainability of pastures in cattle ranching systems was analyzed in terms of economic viability, soil nitrogen stock change, CO2 loss/sequestration, N2O and NO emissions, pollution by herbicides, and nitrogen leaching loss, for a case study in the Northern Atlantic Zone of Costa Rica. Development scenarios were explored for the next 25 years based on degradation and yield decline of current pastures, and on possible introduction of grass-legumes and fertilized improved grass species. With degradation of current pastures, gross margin, soil nitrogen stock, nitrogen leaching and N2O and NO emissions are simulated to decrease in time, whereas CO2 emission and herbicide use increase. With the introduction of grass-legumes or fertilized grasses, the reverse takes place. The conversion of degraded pasture to grass-legumes or fertilized grasses is calculated to lead to a sequestration of CO2 of up to 50 ton C ha(-1), which might be a potential mechanism in mitigating the greenhouse effect. Quantitative, exploratory studies point out the often conflicting nature of different dimensions of sustainability and show possible pathways of sustainable development.

AB African and Asian mountains and highlands are ecoregions of particular importance for sustainable development due to their intensive land-use systems, their generally low economic productivity and integration, and the increasing rates of land degradation and mountain hazards. Opportunities for sustainable development exist, if ways to overcome land degradation can be found. The percentage of people who are engaged in subsistence agriculture can be reduced in favor of the secondary and tertiary sectors, protected areas can be better managed, access to remote areas improved, mountain waters utilized in a more integrated highland-lowland interaction, and mechanisms to manage conflicts developed. Research in support of sustainable development needs to focus on transdisciplinary approaches in order to develop appropriate technologies, improve land-management systems, and most importantly, create an enabling institutional environment. international cooperation is an essential tool for exchanging and communicating successful experiences from the local level to regional levels.

TI Rehabilitation of degraded mountain ecosystems in southwestern China: An
   integrated approach
SO AMBIO
LA English
DT Article
AB The degradation of the mountain ecosystems in southwestern China has been unprecedented in speed and scale over the past decades. Deforestation, overgrazing, water and soil erosion, loss of soil fertility and declining or poor crop yields are alarming indicators of unsustainability due to rapid population pressure. Under the conditions of shortage of arable land, more marginal and forest lands are being reclaimed for agricultural use, and this accelerates the degradation of the fragile mountain ecosystems. Moreover, inaccessibility and a low level of education are preventing development in mountain communities. Agroforestry provides a promising resource-centered technology to meet the twin goals of productivity and conservation. This paper discusses the indigenous agroforestry system practiced in southwestern China, and the promising economic and ecological benefits. People in southwestern China have accumulated abundant knowledge on the utilization of agroforestry technologies to rehabilitate degraded land and the multiple benefits that follow some indigenous practices. Integrating the agroforestry system and modern agricultural technologies can be an effective approach for the sustainable development of mountain ecosystems.

AB This paper highlights the importance of water-resources development for food security and overall socioeconomic development. It describes the management associated with Sardar Sarovar (Narmada) Water Resources Project (SSP), which is under implementation in the Indian Narmada basin of the Satpuda and Vindhyan mountains. The SSP is an interstate multipurpose joint venture of four Indian States namely; Madhya Pradesh (M.P.), Gujarat, Maharashtra, and Rajasthan. The storage dam will submerge 37 533 ha of land and will result in displacement of more than 40 000 families-0.12 million people-from 245 villages in the States of M.P., Gujarat, and Maharashtra. The positive impacts expected from the project are; generation of 1450 megawatts (MW) power; irrigation of a 75 000 ha arid area in Barmer and Jalore districts of Rajasthan and a 1.8 million ha, mostly drought prone, area in Gujarat, environmental improvements etc. The ecosystem approach used in both human rehabilitation and environmental management works for environmentally sustainable development in the Narmada basin and is replicable in mountainous as well as nonmountainous areas.

AB The mountain ecosystems of Kenya include the Mount Kenya, Mount Elgon and Aberdare (Nyandarua) mountain ranges. These mountain areas have been recognized as important ecosystems with high social, spiritual, economic and environmental values. They are used as water catchments, forest reserves, national parks and agricultural land. increasing population pressure on the natural resources of these ecosystems has fed to environment and development challenges such as unsustainable utilization, conversion of forest to cropland, human-wildlife conflicts and highland-lowland resource-use conflicts. Several initiatives are involved in promoting sustainable management and conservation of these important ecosystems. The notable opportunities include changes in government policy to promote integrated and participatory interventions and existing partnerships in resource use and conservation.

TI Patient education model for increasing handwashing compliance
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF INFECTION CONTROL
LA English
DT Article
ID INTENSIVE-CARE UNIT; NOSOCOMIAL INFECTIONS; PREVENTION; EFFICACY
AB Background: A review of the literature on handwashing has documented the absence of research on the education of the patient as an intervention model for changing staff behavior regarding handwashing compliance. The primary objective of this project was to conduct a prospective control study of the effect of patient handwashing education on staff compliance with handwashing.
   Method: A prospective, controlled, 6-week intervention/control study was performed in 4 community hospitals in South Jersey. Each hospital served as its own control. Patients were educated within 24 hours of admission about the importance of asking their health care workers to wash their hands. Soap usage and handwashing was calculated by bed-days. Patient follow-up was conducted through telephone interviews 2 weeks after discharge.
   Results: The patient handwashing education model increased soap usage by health care workers an average of 34% (P = .021); this increase was consistent across hospitals regardless of the initial soap usage rates. Of the patients interviewed, 81% read the materials provided, 57% asked health care workers whether they had washed their hands, and 81% of this 57% said they received positive responses.
   Conclusions: For the first time, our findings document that education of patients regarding their role in monitoring handwashing compliance among health care workers can increase soap usage and handwashing and provide sustainable reinforcement of handwashing principles for health care workers.

AB The objective of this article is to offer some information about traditional practice regarding the use of the genus Buddleia in the Highlands of Chiapas, Mexico, with the aim of increasing its use as a potential fodder for sheep feeding in the area. Based on the indigenous Tzotzil Botanical Classification, three Buddleia groups were taxonomically identified. Group 1 includes the species Buddleia skutchii and Buddleia cordata, group 2, Buddleia americana and Buddleia crotonoides, and group 3, Buddleia parviflora and Buddleia nitida, Even though all these groups have been used as fodder, the most frequently used are the species in group 1, which are the most common species with the widest distribution patterns. Based on their chemical composition, the species of higher nutritional values were B. skutchii and B. crotonoides (crude protein (CP), 10.6% and 9.3%; neutral detergent fiber (NDF), 37.5% and 33.7%; in vitro dry matter digestibility (IVDMD), 75.9% and 58.2%; and digestible energy (DE), 3.3 and 2.5 Mcal/kg). The first one has been recommended for sheep feeding based on its high nutritional value. During an intake and digestibility trial, B. skutchii leaves substituted 50% of Kikuyo grass (Pennisetum clandestinum) without decreasing dry matter (DM) intake and digestibility. These results suggest that the systematic incorporation of B. skutchii into existing sheep production systems could markedly increase feed resources without higher pressure on pasture land.

AB Aquaculture in Western Australian began with the cultivation of trout in the 1930s, although commercial status was not achieved until the cultured pearl industry was established in Broome in the 1950s. Aquaculture, especially in rural Western Australia, remains a relatively new but expanding industry. Aquaculture development in the agricultural areas of Western Australia represents a potential diversification in large tracts of land where salinization has reduced the economic and ecological sustainability of rural industries. The utilization of saline groundwaters for aquaculture presents a major opportunity for economic expansion. The industry is very small and based around finfish species with wide salinity tolerances, The development of an economically and ecologically sustainable industry requires the application of appropriate environmental management procedures, which provide a high-quality product, minimize the impact of the industry on the surrounding environment and provide a long-term competitive advantage.

AB Mouse L-fibroblast cells stably transfected with either type 1 Ins(1,4,5)P-3 receptor (InsP(3)R) cDNA (L15) or the vector control (Lvec) have been used to investigate the functional consequences of increased InsP(3)R density on receptor-mediated Ca2+ signalling. L15 cells express approx. 8-fold higher levels of the type 1 InsP(3)R compared with Lvec cells, which endogenously express essentially only the type 1 InsP(3)R protein. Stimulation of Lvec and L15 cells with UTP or ATP increased cytosolic Ca2+ concentration to a greater extent in L15 cells at all agonist concentrations. UTP and ATP were equipotent, suggestive of the presence of endogenous cell-surface metabotropic P2Y(2)-purinoceptors. In both cell clones the purinoceptors were coupled via pertussis-toxin-insensitive G-protein(s) to phospholipase C activation, resulting in similar concentration-dependent accumulations of InsP(3). Single-cell microfluorimetry revealed that overexpression of InsP(3)Rs reduced the threshold for purinoceptor-mediated Ca2+ signalling. L-fibroblasts also exhibited temporally complex sinusoidal cytosolic Ca2+ oscillations in response to submaximal agonist concentrations, with significant increases in oscillatory frequencies exhibited by cells overexpressing InsP(3)Rs. Sustainable oscillatory responses were dependent on Ca2+ entry and, at higher agonist concentrations, cytosolic Ca2+ oscillations were superseded by biphasic peak-and-plateau Ca2+ responses. Overexpression of InsP(3)Rs in L15 cells resulted in a 4-fold reduction in the threshold for this change in the temporal pattern of Ca2+ mobilization. These data provide the first direct evidence demonstrating that altering the expression of the type 1 InsP(3)R significantly affects receptor-mediated InsP(3)-induced Ca2+ mobilization.

AB The Spanish driftnet fishery operating since 1994 on the Mediterranean side of the Gibraltar Straits was an illegal activity whose main target was the swordfish Xiphias gladius but which also caught other species incidentally, particularly sunfish Mola mola. Observations during the 1993 and 1994 seasons showed that the fleet was composed of 27 boats deploying nets 3-4 km long. Swordfish constituted 7% of the catch in 1992, 5% in 1993 and 7% in 1994. Sunfish represented 71% of the catch in 1992, 93% in 1993 and 90% in 1994. Sea turtles, mainly loggerhead turtles Caretta caretta, constituted 0.32% of the total catch in 1993 and 0.92% in 1994. The incidental capture of small cetaceans, composed entirely of common dolphins Delphinus delphis in 1992 and of striped dolphin Stenella coeruleoalba and common dolphins in roughtly equal proportions in 1993 and 1994, constituted 0.9% of the catch in 1992, 0.6% in 1993 and 1% in 1994. The bycatch rate of dolphins was 0.1 individuals per km of net set. The total catch of dolphins can therefore be estimated at 366 (95% confidence interval 268-464) animals for the 1993 fishing season and 289 (CI 238-340) for that of 1994. If these figures are added to the undetermined catches of dolphins by the Italian and Moroccan driftnet fleets also operating in the region, it is possible that these catches are not sustainable.

AB Forty plots were selected in an old-growth beech forest (Biological Reserve of La Tillaie, Fontainebleau State Forest, France), to embrace the whole range of site conditions and phases of vegetation dynamics. Soils are sandy, thus the nutrient status of the topsoil is very poor except when trees have access to an underlying limestone layer. The study was focused on the role of calcium in the sustainability of the beech ecosystem. Calcium is mostly redistributed through leaf litter accretion and the activity of litter-consuming organisms, but other sources are fallen wood and uprooted mounds. In each of the 40 plots, earthworm species were sampled, and measurements were taken in order to describe humus profiles, growth of adult trees, litter quantity and quality, and access to lime. Densities of soil-dwelling earthworms, calcium content of beech leaf litter, height of tallest tries and depth of the limestone layer were correlated, indicating a gradient of soil fertility which mainly results from long-term interactions between soil organisms and trees in varying geological conditions. Possible causal relationships and implications of calcium turnover for nature conservation were discussed in the light of existing knowledge.

ID SOIL
AB In the forest-savanna ecotone around Puerto Ayacucho, Amazonas State, Venezuela, characterized by sandy entisols and ultisols with very low natural fertility, some producers have established agroforestry systems (AFS) of production on savanna soils by adding animal manure as the main fertilizer. This paper examines the earthworm communities in a natural savanna (NS) and in an AFS supplied with organic fertilizers established over 25 years ago. Organic matter management of the savanna soils has strongly modified the earthworm populations in the studied AFS as compared with the original savanna soil. Earthworm density was found to be 1.6-4.8 times higher in the AFS than in the original savanna, The correlations among earthworm populations and soil parameters suggested that earthworms in AFS can be limited by the amounts of food (organic matter) present in the soil. Moisture, in turn, affects other parameters that are important for earthworm distribution. Our results emphasized the importance of appropriate organic-matter management and the relevance of earthworms in such agroecosystems. By promoting the use of the earthworm population as an agroecological factor linked to low levels of organic fertilization, it is possible to promote major agroecological sustainability in sandy savanna soils.

DT Article
AB Advanced communications technology and services (ACTS) provide the platform whereby the business, political, administrative and social communities communicate, organise and transact all of the important relationships and exchanges which form the socioecomonic life of our planet. The increasing concern with sustainability of physical, social and business resources as a basis for continued development at a global scale identifies a number of concerns which implicate advanced telecommunications technologies and services as a key determinant of sustainability 'best practice'. This paper attempts to summarise the current sustainable-development debate and to position recent developments in the ACTS programme of CEC DG13 as exemplars of positive responses to need-both in, terms of demonstrations of current good practice and guidelines for future practice.

   GROWTH; MODEL; CROPS; USA
AB The Ogallala or High Plains aquifer provides water for about 20% of the irrigated land in the United States. About 20 km(3) (16.6 million acre-feet) of water are withdrawn annually from this aquifer. In general, recharge has not compensated for withdrawals since major irrigation development began in this region in the 1940s. The mining of the Ogallala has been pictured as an analogue to climate change in that many GCMs predict a warmer and drier future for this region. In this paper we attempt to anticipate the possible impacts of climate change on the sustainability of the aquifer as a source of water for irrigation and other purposes in the region. We have applied HUMUS, the Hydrologic Unit Model of the U.S. to the Missouri and Arkansas-White-Red water resource regions that overlie the Ogallala. We have imposed three general circulation model (GISS, UKTR and BMRC) projections of future climate change on this region and simulated the changes that may be induced in water yields (runoff plus lateral flow) and ground water recharge. Each GCM was applied to HUMUS at three levels of global mean temperature (GMT) to represent increasing severity of climate change (a surrogate for time). HUMUS was also run at three levels of atmospheric CO2 concentration (hereafter denoted by [CO2]) in order to estimate the impacts of direct CO2 effects on photosynthesis and evapotranspiration. Since the UKTR and GISS GCMs project increased precipitation in the Missouri basin, water yields increase there. The BMRC GCM predicts sharply decreased precipitation and, hence, reduced water yields. Precipitation reductions are even greater in the Arkansas basin under BMRC as are the consequent water yield losses. GISS and UKTR climates lead to only moderate yield losses in the Arkansas. CO2-fertilization reverses these losses and yields increase slightly. CO2 fertilization increases recharge in the base (no climate change) case in both basins. Recharge is reduced under all three GCMs and severities of climate change.

AB Ocean wave spectra were for many years regarded as scientific information of little use for practical purposes. In the last decade, this has changed. Within many marine sectors there are now stronger demands for more accurate spectral information which directly have an impact on safety and regularity of operations and on the sustainability of constructions. This paper shows examples of applications, mostly from routine forecasting service experience in the North Sea and the North East Atlantic. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A current paradigm in conservation biology is that forest harvest practices that better approximate natural disturbance processes are more likely to conserve biodiversity. We contrasted bird communities in three replicate stands in each of 1, 13-15, and 22-28 yr old forests following wildfire and harvest in north-central Alberta, Canada. Stands were chosen from old (>120 yr) boreal mixedwood forests having greater than or equal to 95% of the canopy trees killed during fire, and harvested sites retaining an average of 6% of the pre-harvest canopy trees. For all age classes, postharvest sites tended to have greater bird abundance. Species composition also differed between these treatment types. Two-Way Indicator Species Analysis (TWINSPAN) identified five major ecological groupings of species that differed between wildfire and harvest, and among stand ages. Correspondence analysis (CA) identified similar bird communities. Greatest differences between bird communities occurred immediately following disturbance, and gradual convergence of communities occurred throughout the first 28 yr after disturbance. Species associated with open shrub and grassland or riparian habitats were associated primarily with I-yr postharvest stands. Three-toed Woodpeckers (Picoides tridactyla) and Black-backed Woodpeckers (P. arcticus), together with other species that use snags for foraging or nesting, occurred primarily in 1-yr postwildfire stands. Convergence in avian communities was correlated with the loss of standing snags on postwildfire sites. However, differences in bird communities were apparent up to 28 yr following disturbance, and this lack of complete convergence has important consequences for sustainable forestry practices designed to maintain biodiversity in the boreal mixedwood forest. Notably, Connecticut Warbler (Oporornis agilis), Brown Creeper (Certhia americana), Winter Wren (Troglodytes troglodytes), and American Robin (Turdus migratorius) had higher densities on postwildfire than on postharvest stands. Lincoln's Sparrow (Melospiza georgiana), Alder Flycatcher (Empidonax alnorum), Tennessee Warbler (Vermivora peregrina), Black-and-white Warbler (Mniotilta varia), American Redstart (Setophaga rutticilla), Mourning Warbler (Oporornis philadelphia), Rose-breasted Grosbeak (Pheucticus ludoviciana), Canada Warbler (Wilsonia canadensis), and Pine Siskin (Carduelis pinus) had higher densities on postharvest stands, possibly due to the greater abundance, after harvest, of larger live residual trees and a taller and more dense shrub layer. Harvest designed to approximate stand-replacing fires may require the retention of more snags than is currently practiced. New approaches to fire salvage logging are also required to ensure adequate retention of standing dead trees on the landscape.

AB High-elevation forests in the northeastern United States have received large amounts of atmospheric deposition of pollutants that may alter natural element cycling and retention rates in a variety of ways. This study examined atmospheric deposition of N, S, and base cations (Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, Na+), and their impact on element cycling, in a high-elevation forest on Whiteface Mountain, New York, USA. Ten years of element cycling data (1986-1995) showed that at our study site (1050-m elevation) precipitation and cloud water contributed most of the atmospheric deposition relative to dry deposition. Input-output budgets revealed a net retention of N in this forest. Tn contrast, annual variations in outputs of K+ were roughly balanced by atmospheric inputs. Potassium output seemed to be strongly related to and dependent on K+ inputs. There was a net loss of Ca2+, Mg2+, and SO42- from the site. Calcium and SO42- outputs were related to one another and to water inputs to the forest. Net loss of 2.9 kg S.ha(-1).yr(-1) was likely supplied by the large mineral soil S pool. The difference between atmospheric input and ecosystem export of 7.4 kg Ca.ha(-1).yr(-1) may or may not be sustainable, depending on replacement by mineral weathering. The dominance of inorganic N species in all solutions except O-horizon leachate supports the idea that the forest is heavily impacted by N deposition. However, the decrease in NO3- export from the forest observed during the study and the continued accumulation of N in vegetation suggest that N saturation has not yet occurred.

AB Implementation of an ecosystem approach to natural resource management requires evaluation of a broad array of ecological services in a multidimensional, community-based watershed approach that empowers people to make informed management decisions. Conventional economic approaches that assign values to ecological services (contingent valuation) or that evaluate the efficiency of preserving and restoring those services (cost-benefit analysis) are quite limited for this purpose. In addition to the methodological difficulties encountered in applying contingent valuation and cost-benefit analysis, several problems occur when nonmarket values of ecological services are estimated independently of ecosystem planning and management. Multiple attribute decision-making (MADM) is an alternative conceptual framework for evaluating and selecting land and water resource management systems (LWRMS). Advantages of MADM are that it facilitates community-based collaborative decision-making, avoids some of the ethical, theoretical and practical shortcomings of conventional economic approaches, does not require assigning monetary Values to ecological services, allows consideration of multiple attributes and is not culturally biased. The MADM model described in this paper explains how a property manager selects the most preferred LWRMS for a property based on their multiple stochastic attributes. Application of the model requires determination of the technically feasible LWRMS for a property and specification of the socially acceptable ranges of attributes. This information is combined with economic/biophysical simulations to derive the efficient combination of attributes and LWRMS for a property. The property manager then selects the most preferred combination of attributes from the efficient combinations of attributes for a property using utility maximization, surrogate worth tradeoff, free iterative search, analytical hierarchy process, Aspiration-Reservation Based Decision Support System or stochastic dominance, A watershed alliance can evaluate the sustainability of the most preferred LWRMS for properties in a watershed based on a weak or strong sustainability criterion. If the alliance determines that the most preferred LWRMS are not sustainable, then an index of attributes is used to evaluate the cost effectiveness of alternative public policies for stimulating the adoption of more sustainable LWRMS.

ID SUSTAINABILITY
AB As economic systems develop over time they tend to become more complex with more structure and greater throughputs, assuming favorable conditions. Energy use increases as more economic sectors develop and more channels for flow are opened. Economic diversity, as measured by the number of economic sectors using energy and the equatability of flows between them, generally increases. As diversity increases the efficiency of generating outputs with a given amount of energy also increases. Development capacity, the product of system energy throughput and diversity of flows, is a measure of the potential system output and is calculated for selected countries. Capacity changes over time are shown to relate to changes in economic output in selected countries. Two distinct development strategies become evident, one which promotes energy use and one which emphasizes diversity. While most countries utilize a mix of the two, developing countries generally rely more on increasing energy use to increase output while developed countries tend to become more diverse as a means of increasing outputs. Sustainability is enhanced by strategies which promote diversity and resource use efficiency in economic systems. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

ID TIMBER
AB The main purpose of this article is to evaluate different policy options for promoting low-impact logging through the use of economic incentives. To do this we construct a small optimal control theory model within an integrated framework including both the biological and the economic implications of timber extraction. The approach uses detailed stock, yield and cost data from Ghana. A numerical solution is reached by the use of multi-period non-linear optimisation. Direct subsidies to low-impact logging activities through area-dependent subsidies is found to be far more efficient than subsidising prices of tropical timber. The model takes a novel approach in combining growth and stock in a tropical forest area with the cost and damage connected with timber extraction. II allows us to analyse the interactions between stock, growth, timber extraction, logging damage and operating costs in an integrated manner. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper studies the possibility of nonlinear dynamics in a simple overlapping generations model with the environment - the John-Pecchenino (1994) model. We show that if people's concerns towards greener preferences and the maintenance efficiency relative to degradation are not sufficiently high, cyclically or chaotically fluctuating equilibria are more likely to exist; moreover, under a specific condition, a complicated topological structure might emerge. Our short-run analysis complements John and Pecchenino's long-run analysis and our findings suggest that the associated transition towards an environmentally sustainable state is not trivial.

DE vacuum arc for formation of AIN; medium-vacuum region; discharge
   continuity; power supply
AB The continuity of a steered vacuum are with Al cathode and N-2 flow at a pressure between 0.1 and 5 Pa is investigated. Two constant-current power supplies (60 V open-circuit voltage/30 V load voltage and 310 V/240 V) and a constant-voltage power supply with open-circuit voltage 550 V are used. The are current is 30 A, the N-2 flow rate is 20 ml/min, and the transverse magnetic field density at the cathode edge is 1.2 mT. The following results are obtained. (1) When the power supply with lower open-circuit and load voltages is used, a decrease in pressure causes the are to lose sustainability. (2) When the power supply with high open-circuit and load voltages is used, the are can continue even at lower pressure. (3) When the power supply with higher load voltage is used, abnormal discharge behind the magnet field guide-disk may occur at lower pressure.
   The above-mentioned influence of power supply on are continuity is interpreted in terms of column fall and generation of a new cathode spot. (C) 1999 Scripta Technica.

SO ENERGY ECONOMICS

DE new Zealand electricity distribution; electricity regulation;
   unsustainable natural monopoly; contestability
AB The ongoing reform of New Zealand's electricity supply industry has attempted to separate its potentially competitive elements from those with naturally monopolistic characteristics. Yet, some competition for distribution services is occurring, raising the question as to whether electricity distributors are natural monopolies as is typically assumed. This paper presents a simple model of a representative New Zealand distribution business, and shows that, in a true economic sense, distributors are most probably sustainable natural monopolies as expected. However, the model demonstrates that a mechanism for competition may arise because the financial principles enshrined in the Ministry of Commerce's regulatory regime can produce unsustainable cost structures and unintentionally introduce elements of contestability into the market for distribution services.

Scarcity indicators can be classified by what is being measured: value of the resource stock or value of extracted resource commodities; who's value is considered: social vs. private scarcity; and by the mode of valuation considered: exchange value and use value. Prices and rents are common measures of exchange value or indicators of "exchange scarcity" and unit costs can be seen as use value indicators or indicators of "use scarcity". The major aim of this paper is to demonstrate the links between productivity indicators such as unit costs and the classical concept of use value. The two classes of indicator relate to John Commons' discussions of scarcity and efficiency, and a marginal vs. a non-marginal approach to value and scarcity. The classical use value concept also has wider relevance for issues of valuation in energy, resource, and environmental policy. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Many environmental management issues can be defined as allocation problems, e.g., the allocation of rights to use common-pool resources or the allocation of the cost of regional resource development projects. The allocation methods developed in the area of cooperative n-person game theory are most appropriate for these problems because they focus on the conditions for engendering and sustaining the necessary cooperation among the involved stakeholders. These solution concepts seek to ensure that the allocation is based on some norm of equity and, most often, also to minimize the incentive for any player to defect from the cooperative venture. We illustrate these solution concepts with an application to a water resource project in Southern California. We argue how the rigorous mathematical nature of these solution concepts should not hinder their application to actual situations and how, with the use of heuristic rules and inexact notions of comparable worths, we can employ these concepts even in approximate fashion. We remind ourselves that the goal of such an endeavor is to convince stakeholders of the equity of a proposed solution and, in so doing, maximize the prospect of sustained cooperation. The alternative to cooperation, on the other hand, may be endless stalemate.

AB Unsustainable agricultural policies and water and soil resource schemes have drained two thirds of Mediterranean wetlands since 1920. An outstanding example is Karla in Greece, a former internationally important wetland that was drained in 1962 causing environmental, social, and water and soil problems. The objective of this study was to assess the functions and values of Karla, at three periods of its history, and to relate them to major events in the management of the water and soil resources of its watershed. Information on wetland and watershed features was collected from historical records and field visits. The results showed that the wetland in its pristine state had performed five functions to a high degree, one (groundwater recharge) to a moderate degree, and one (flood storage) to a low degree. Flood-control works, uncontrolled pumping, etc., in 1936-1961 degraded all functions except microclimate modification while, the bird supper? function was moderately altered. Drainage works in 1962 left a very small artificially flooded wetland with only four functions performed to an insignificant degree. Value degradation followed function degradation. It was concluded that past resource management has been nonintegrated. No consideration was given to the multiple functions and values of Karla. Previous restoration proposals involved the reinstatement of one or two functions only The appropriate restoration scheme for Karla must be multiobjective and based on the integrated resource management of its own and the neighboring watersheds.

AB The objectives of this study are to: (1) characterize the meteorology and hydrology of the Maya Mountain-Marine Area Transect in southern Belize, (2) employ a simple water balance model to examine the discharge rates of seven watersheds to Port Honduras, (3) test the validity of the hydrological model, (4) explore the implications of potential landscape and hydrological alterations, and (5) examine the value of protected areas. The southern coastal portion of the study area is classified as wet tropical forest and the remainder as moist tropical forest. Rainfall is 3000-4000 mm annually. Resulting annual freshwater discharge directly into Port Honduras is calculated at 2.5 x 10(9) m(3), a volume equal to the basin. During the rainy season, June-September, 84% of the annual discharge occurs, which causes the bay to become brackish. Port Honduras serves as an important nursery ground for many species of commercially important fish and shellfish. The removal of forest cover in the uplands, as a result of agriculture, aquaculture, and village development, is likely to significantly accelerate erosion. Increased erosion would reduce soil fertility in the uplands and negatively affect mangrove, seagrass, and coral reef productivity in the receiving coastal embayment. Alternatively, the conservation of an existing protected areas corridor, linking the Maya Mountains to the Caribbean Sea, is likely to enhance regional sustainable economic development. This study aims to support environmental management at the scale of the "ecoscape"-a sensible ecological unit of linked watersheds and coastal and marine environments.

AB The Bemba people of northern Zambia practice citemene shifting cultivation. We utilized Landsat satellite images from 1984 and 1992 to map the distribution of citemene fields in those two years and to assess changes in the spatial sustainability of citemene cultivation in a miombo woodland study area. The citemene fields were concentrated within about 5-6 km of roads. Between 1984 and 1992, there was a decrease in the number of fields, and an increase in the average distance from the road. These changes may have been due to the introduction of semipermanent maize farming in the intervening years. The estimated cycle times for woodland utilization may have been long enough to maintain sustainability under traditional citemene cultivation practices. However, cycle times may be too short to maintain sustainability within the woodlands along roads.

LA English
DT Article
DE Brent Spar; rationality; science; precaution; sustainability
ID PRECAUTIONARY PRINCIPLE
AB In June 1995, a campaign by Greenpeace forced the multinational oil company Shell to cancel its planned disposal of a redundant oil installation in the Atlantic. The Brent Spar incident attracted massive publicity and was influential in changing government policy on marine disposal of waste. During and following their campaign, Greenpeace were criticised as emotive and irrational by Shell and academic scientists. This paper looks at the arguments used during the debate, using literature, interviews and questionnaires. We investigate the use of key environmental words and phrases and ask what is meant by rationality in this context. We discuss some of the lessons that should be learnt from the incident by policy makers and scientists.

DE voluntary modesty; international sociological comparison
AB The effective solution of environmental problems calls for changes in levels of consumption. Sociologists have described moderation in households of high socio-economic status in affluent countries, and also a type of modesty which cannot be a response to the experience of abundance. However, its essence is not the way of life of a traditional community. Sustainable living based on self-restraint could be considered to be a symptom of the summit of cultural evolution to date. Nevertheless, historical experience warns us against making too much of contemporary cases of moderation.

AB Fishing has been a part of the traditional heritage of Kuwait for centuries. Nearly 130 fish species are known to occur in Kuwait waters. The fin-fish fisheries are licensed to be caught by gill nets, gargoor traps and hand lines using dhow wooden and fibreglass boats. A complete ban on fishing within the 3-mile limit off the Kuwait coast and Kuwait Bay has been maintained as part of conservation of fish breeding and nursery areas. However only Hadra stake nets are allowed to be operated for fin-fish catches within the coastal zone. Annual 1995 fin-fish catch comprised nearly 80% of the total marine fisheries' harvest. Recent catch composition of highly palatable fish, namely the silver croaker, Otolithes argenteus, the shad, Hilsa ilisha, the silver pomfret, Pampus argenteus, the brown spotted grouper, Epinephelus tauvina and the silvery grunt, Pomadasys argenteus has been found to be 23, 17, 16, 5 and 3% of the total fin-fish catch respectively. It has been noticed that edible fish preference varies from state to state as species-specific preferences appear to differ among Gulf tribes. The consumer demand for fish and the price stability equilibrium have been evaluated. The pattern of regional fin-fish import and export has been discussed. Although mariculture production potential has been estimated to be high, only 90 tons/annum of sea bream has been cultivated in floating cages. Kuwait Institute of Scientific Research in collaboration with the Public Authority for Agriculture Affairs and Fish Resources have initiated cultivation of tilapia and other fish species in the local brackish water fish farms. Suggestions and recommendations have been made for sustainable fin-fish development in Kuwait. (C) 1999 Academic Press.

DE demersal fisheries; Arabian Sea; Gulf of Oman; Arabian Gulf
AB The demersal fisheries of the Arabian Sea, the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Gulf are reviewed. The region comprises eight countries: Oman, United Arab Emirates (U.A.E.), Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Kuwait, Iraq and Iran. Over 350 commercial fish species, eight shrimp species, two spiny lobster species, one shovel nose lobster species, one cuttlefish species, one crab species, and one abalone species support the demersal fisheries in the continental shelves of the three regions. Artisanal and industrial vessels with over 120 000 fishermen were involved in demersal fisheries. Fishing boats include fish and shrimp trawlers (wooden and steel hulled), large wooden boats (dhow) with inboard engines, small dhows with outboard engines, and fibreglass boats. Fishing gear consists of trawls, bottom gill nets, traps (wire mesh and plastic types), barrier traps, hand lines, and bare hands and knives (to dislodge abalone). Demersal fish (primarily Lethrinidae, Sparidae, Serranidae, Siganidae, Sciaenidae, Stromateidae, Lutjanidae, Trichiuridae, and Nemipteridae) and shrimp (primarily Penaeus semisulcatus, Metapenaeus affinis, Parapenaeopsis stylifera, and Penaeus merguiensis) were the two commercial demersal resources. Approximately 198 000-214 000 tomes (t) of demersals were landed annually during 1988-1993, accounting for nearly 40% of the total marine landings (475 000-552 000 t). This percentage, however varied among countries: 25% in Oman, 32% in U.A.E., 71% in Qatar, 52% in Saudi Arabia, 56% in Bahrain, 55% in Kuwait, close to 100% in Iraq, and 41% in Iran. Fishing effort on certain stocks may have been below the optimum level (e.g. certain Omani demersal fish), near the optimum level (e.g. Omani shrimp), or above the optimum level (e.g. Arabian Gulf shrimp and demersal fish). Overexploitation led to restriction of fishing effort by limiting fishing licences, regulating fishing gear (mesh size) and capture size, closing fishing areas, restricting fishing season, and banning certain fisheries. However, fisheries management was hampered by lack of appropriate management regulations, enforcement and data on most stocks. Pollution and degradation of nursery areas were also affecting the productivity of fisheries resources. To achieve sustainable demersal fisheries, maintaining a healthy marine environment, reducing fishing effort, and strictly enforcing closed seasons and closed areas are needed. These measures are being implemented with varying degrees of success by all the countries. (C) 1999 Academic Press.

TI Trends in an Indonesian coastal fishery based on catch and effort
   statistics and implications for the perception of the state of the
   stocks by fisheries officials
SO FISHERIES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
DE trend-analysis; perception; variance; coastal fisheries; Indonesia
AB Indonesia's capture fisheries are monitored in each district of all 27 provinces with a comprehensive catch and effort data recording system that was installed in 1976. The annual data are sent to the Indonesian Directorate General of Fisheries (DGF) in Jakarta, where these are aggregated for nine regions. Catches for the 45 recognised fish categories are accumulated in four major fish groups and analysed with conventional fisheries surplus models to estimate maximum sustainable yields (MSYs). These estimates have been used by DGF to determine the number of fishing licenses for each region in the nation's economic exclusive zone (EEZ). This paper discusses the effect of data aggregation and accumulation on the variance around trends in fisheries data of the South Sulawesi province. Simple regression techniques are applied to time series of catch, effort, catch-per-unit-effort, and numbers of boats. At the lowest level of data aggregation and accumulation we find the highest variance. Although high variance obscures the perception on the state of fish stocks at the lowest levels, perceptions at the highest levels are not necessarily more useful for fisheries management. Bias caused by motorisation of the fleet by using CpUE as an indicator of fisheries mortality and by combining data from administrative units that have no ecological or biological meaning obscures the detection of trends.

TI Household food security in semi-arid Africa - the contribution of
   participatory adaptive research and development to rural livelihoods in
   Eastern Kenya

   adjustment programmes; adaptive research; sustainable rural livelihoods
AB The already precarious household food-security situation in many semi-arid areas of Africa may be rendered more so through the implementation of structural adjustment programmes that frequently prescribe austerity measures, along with a safety net to protect the vulnerable. However, longer-term development policy perspectives on the one hand, and shorter-term food-relief considerations on the other, often conflict. This paper illuminates the policy conflicts which arise when local-level research and development initiatives interface with the effects of macro-policy-initiated changes and safety-net interventions. Using a participatory agricultural research project in Eastern Kenya as a case study, the paper describes specific household food-security problem diagnosis and a range of research interventions planned within a more sustainable rural livelihoods framework. Working with local farmers, the project implemented a range of applied research and linked development interventions that showed promise in easing food security through a broadening of the livelihood base. Some of these initiatives were carried further through the local farmers' own initiative. The conclusion is that semi-arid areas, despite views that see these as low-potential and obvious safety-net candidates, often have potential for agricultural intensification and increased productivity. However, to ensure that research results are utilised and farmers have access to new technology and markets, there is a need for external or public-sector support to integrated longer-term development initiatives. This may require rethinking the scope of research and development approaches, particularly removing unhelpful boundaries between research, extension and development functions, and increasing farmer participation in the whole process-if possible as part of a less centralised and more household-oriented approach to food-security policy and strategy.

DE timber production; environmental regulations; pulp and paper industry;
   social accounting matrix
AB Economy-wide and distributive impacts of: (1) an $80 million increase in pulp and paper exports; (2) a $10 million decrease in lumber exports; (3) a 25% increase in the costs of timber production; and (4) a 25% increase in the costs of pulp and paper production in Alberta's forest sector are examined. A social accounting matrix (SAM)-based quantity model is used to examine the first two shocks, while a SAM-based price model is used to analyze the last two shocks. The results of the quantity model suggest that higher income households get a larger share of the benefits than lower income households in response to an expansion in the pulp and paper industry, A contraction in the lumber sector will hurt higher income households more than lower income households. Larger shares of medium and higher income households in total labor income and capital rents are identified as reasons for this asymmetric response, The results of the price model suggest that additional costs associated with sustainable forest management and environmental regulations will hurt lower income households more than higher income households. The higher share of consumer expenditure in total income for lower income households when compared to that of high income households may be responsible for this result.

AB In the 1960s there were large-scale concerns about the world's ability to feed itself. However, widespread adoption of "green revolution" technology led to major increases in food-grain production. Between 1966 and 1990, the population of the densely populated low-income countries grew by 80%, but food production more than doubled. The technological advance that led to the dramatic achievements in world food production over the last 30 years was the development of high-yielding varieties of wheat and rice. These varieties are responsive to fertilizer inputs, are lodging resistant, and their yield potential is 2-3 times that of varieties available prior to the green revolution. In addition, these varieties have multiple resistance to diseases and insects and thus have yield stability. The development of irrigation facilities, the availability of inorganic fertilizers, and benign government policies have all facilitated the adoption of green-revolution technology. In the 1990s, the rate of growth in food-grain production has been lower than the rate of growth in population. If this trend is not reversed, serious food shortages will occur in the next century. To meet the challenge of feeding 8 billion people by 2020, we have to prepare now and develop the technology for raising farm productivity. We have to develop cereal cultivars with higher yield potential and greater yield stability. We must also develop strategies for integrated nutrient management, integrated pest management, and efficient utilization of water and soil resources.

AB Evaluation of soil aggregate stability under managed fallow systems is very relevant in the assessment of their agricultural sustainability. It is also important to identify the parameters that are most responsive to the effects of these fallow systems on aggregate stability. This study was carried out in southwestern Nigeria to quantify the effects of various fallow management systems on the macroaggregate stability of surface soil (0-15-cm depth) using a long-term fallow management trial established in 1989 on an Alfisol toposequence. Data were collected between 1994 and 1995. Three fallow systems (bush fallow, Pueraria phaseoloides, and Leucaena leucocephala) and three fallow periods (1-3 years after 1-year cropping) were evaluated. Cropping consisted of maize + cassava intercropping. A split-plot design with fellow systems as main plot and cropping intensities as subplot in four replications was used in the trial. Soil aggregate samples were wet-sieved to evaluate their mean-weight diameter (MWD) and fractal dimension (D). The means of MWD for the fallow systems and cropping intensities ranged from 2.4 to 6.4 mm. The mean D values ranged from 2.29 to 2.72 while the mean intercepts (log k) of the regression ranged from 2.01 to 2.28. Low D values (cohesive and stable aggregates) were associated with fallowing whereas high D values (fragmented aggregates) were associated with cultivation. Fallowing enhanced soil aggregate stability. The Pueraria system also enhanced soil aggregate stability more than the bush fallow and Leucaena systems when continuous cropping was practised. The subplots, which were fallowed for 2 or 3 years after 1 year of cropping, were usually similar in aggregate stability to the secondary forest soil. Fractal analysis showed further that soil aggregates in the dry season and on the upper slope of the toposequence were more cohesive than in the wet season and on the lower slope. Observed D and log k values were also significantly influenced by laboratory method. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Acoustic Doppler current profilers (ADCPs) provide a means to measure the components of water current velocities in three dimensions. Such instruments have been used widely by the oil industry in deep offshore waters but their application to nearshore coastal and estuarine environments has been principally confined to the USA. Using examples of ADCP datasets acquired from the macrotidal Tay Estuary, eastern Scotland, the principles of field deployment, data acquisition and forms of output are critically summarised. It is shown, for the first time in the Tay Estuary, that vertical current Velocities are significant and are particularly so in downwelling zones associated with the development and passage of axially convergent tidal fronts. The improved understanding of three-dimensional water and suspended sediment dynamics in coastal and estuarine waters is crucial to, inter alia, the sustainable management of effluent discharges and, in more general terms, it is predicted on the basis of the Tay case study, that ADCP measurements afford significant opportunities to refine understanding of geomorphological processes in a variety of aquatic environments worldwide.

AB The participation of affected communities in the development of public health intervention research improves project sustainability and effectiveness by making projects more relevant and acceptable to the communities. This article presents a multimode, multidomain model approach for community participation in different project components, which ensures the benefits of participation without requiring the same level of participation in every activity or by every community sector. A case study is used to illustrate the model, describing procedures for establishing and maintaining farmworker participation in developing an intervention to reduce exposure to chemicals. Farmworkers are a poor and underserved population for which the empowering and culturally appropriate benefits of community participation are especially needed. However, this population presents challenges for participatory health projects: geographic dispersion, ethnic diversity, lack of organization, sense of powerlessness, and communication and transportation difficulties. The lessons learned in this case extend the method and theory of community participation.

TI Health promotion in the Scottish workplace: a case for moving the
   goalposts
SO HEALTH EDUCATION RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB The workplace provides an important opportunity for health promotion, both in terms of allowing access to a large proportion of the adult population and encouraging developments within the workplace structure to improve health. This paper reports on the findings of a survey of Scottish workplaces carried out in 1996 for the Health Education Board for Scotland to assess the state of health promotion activity in the Scottish workplace setting. The results echo those from previous surveys in that most health promotion effort was centred around health and safety, smoking, and alcohol issues, particularly for the smaller and less well-resourced businesses. Under one-fifth of businesses surveyed addressed areas such as stress and mental health, which are being seen as increasingly important in terms of their contribution to the well-being of the employee and the organization. The main implication of these findings is that it is smaller businesses who potentially have the most to gain from workplace health promotion, In this context, the construction of relevant and sustainable health promotion programmes requires an organizational development perspective in order to encourage such businesses to regard workplace health promotion as part of good business practice.

AB Taxol(R) (paclitaxel), an important anticancer agent, is found in many species of Sew. As the need for Taxol increases, sustainable sources must be found for this drug. Plants often respond to stress with increased production of terpenoid compounds such as Taxol and related taxanes or hormones such as abscisic acid (ABA), To determine whether water stress would enhance the production and recovery of Taxol from stem clippings, 100 young Taxus xmedia 'Hicksii' shrubs were grown for sustainable production of Taxol from stem clippings for two seasons in the dry climate of the Malheur Experiment Station in Ontario, Ore. Shrubs were grown under minimal, moderate, or severe water stress, and the relationships between taxane content and 1) soil and plant water potentials, 2) percentage of stomatal closure, and 3) ABA content were examined, Severely water-stressed shrubs produced significantly more taxanes and ABA than did the less stressed shrubs. Chemical names used: Taxol; 10-deacetyl baccatin III; baccatin III; 10-deacetyl taxol, cephalomannine; 7-epi; 10-deacetyl taxol; abscisic acid. Taxol is a registered trademark of Bristol-Myers Squibb.
