TI Employee relations issues for US companies in Mexico
SO CALIFORNIA MANAGEMENT REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
AB Low labor costs are a key attraction for companies seeking to establish or expand operations in Mexico. However, the realization of sustainable low costs while maintaining high quality requires managerial approaches adapted to the Mexican business environment. Companies doing business in Mexico need to understand the significant culturally based differences between U.S. and Mexican approaches to employee relations. This article examines employee relations in Mexico from the perspective of U.S. managers, identifies pivotal features of Mexican employee relations, and offers pragmatic guidelines for managing employee relations south of the border.

AB The paper describes livestock herding in Shimshal, an indigenous mountain community in Pakistan, with particular attention to the considerations that inform herding decisions, Ethnographic fieldwork in Shimshal reveals two main categories of consideration: instrumental and symbolic, Habermas' theory oi communicative action provides a basis for reformulating these categories into a set of conceptually integrated ideal types of resources and for arguing that instrumental and symbolic resources provide motivations toward consumption and conservation, respectively, Two examples of outside interventions to Shimshal's pastoral ecology reveal the limitations of conceptualizing indigenous resource use in purely instrumentation terms, The paper concludes with a call to conceptualize indigenous community sustainability in instrumental and symbolic terms.

AB Soil management practices that contribute to increased soil productivity and long-term sustainable agricultural production have been neglected over the last four decades. The need to increase soil productivity led to the evaluation of a system of disposing of large quantities of organic by-products and poultry litter on agricultural land. Our objectives were to evaluate the effects of applying noncomposted municipal solid waste (MSW), amended with either poultry litter (PL) or NH4NO3 to adjust C:N ratios in the soil surface in either the spring or fall. Changes in soil chemical properties, bacteria population shifts, changes in species richness and evenness of indigenous soil bacteria, and response by cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) were evaluated. Soil P, K, Ca, and Mg were increased in the surface 0-15 cm by a factor of three or four times by application of organic by-products. After two annual applications, soil Cu increased slightly, Zn doubled, Co and Cr decreased, while Pb increased by a factor of two. Soil organic matter content increased on average by 89 percent for treatments containing newsprint, yard trimmings, and cotton gin trash. Newsprint plus NH4NO3 resulted in a shift to more Gram positive bacteria, while newsprint plus poultry Litter resulted in a shift to more Gram negative bacteria. Both N sources resulted in a reduction in Bacillus sp. Shifts in the bacterial populations and changes in species richness (number of species detected) and evenness (relative abundance of each species) were induced by organic by-product additions. These shifts appear to be the result of increased substrate for C mineralization rather than any properties of biological control. Shifts in the microbial community structure towards Gram negative organisms may benefit plant growth and may be useful as an indicator of soil quality.

AB The development of statistics, as with any other tool, can only be understood in relation to their particular uses. This is confirmed by the development of National Income estimates and of the National Accounts. Proposals to integrate environmental costs and benefits into the National Accounts can similarly only be evaluated by considering them in the context of their likely policy use. The most important potential use is as a general measure of welfare or progress, for policy to aim to maximise. Environmentally adjusted National Accounts correspond to a very weak view of sustainability. The use of adjusted National Income as a measure of welfare essentially assumes complete substitutability between manufactured and natural capital. Problems of monetary valuation are likely to lead to huge underestimation of environmental costs. Issues of inequality and poverty, essential to a more robust view of sustainability, are ignored. Policy targeting a revised National Income will continue to aim for ever higher output while making very limited concessions to environmental concerns. Adjusting the National Accounts for environmental costs is not the only way to ensure they are allowed for in policy making. An alternative approach, more appropriate if sustainable development in the stronger sense is to be achieved, is the construction and use of a set of social and environmental indicators.

AB It is clear from the scale of anthropogenic resource use that economic systems should be brought within biophysical limits as soon as possible. One might assume that this task is difficult because it would involve identifying these limits, knowing when and where they are breached, and allocating responsibility. However, an intimate understanding of the natural limits to economic development may not be necessary for achieving a biophysically sustainable economy. Certain measurable features of the natural world are intimately connected with overall biophysical integrity, one such feature being biological diversity, A growing body of ecological research gives compelling evidence that biodiversity confers stability on ecosystems by buffering them against natural and artificial perturbations, and that it increases system productivity. It is well known that the stability and productivity of ecosystems are fundamental components of the earth's biophysical integrity. Therefore, biodiversity should act as a measure of biophysical integrity and biodiversity conservation might provide a viable framework for policies that drive economic activity towards overall biophysical sustainability. Economic instruments to implement a biodiversity constraint would penalise economic activities that directly or indirectly cause biodiversity loss and favour those that conserve it, A biodiversity constraint would, of course, require new legal and institutional underpinnings. What makes a biodiversity constraint doubly attractive is that it would also conserve the potentially large economic use and option values of biodiversity itself, thus removing the need for separate measures for its conservation.

TI Sustainable development: Looking for new strategies

   information
ID ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
AB Many strategies have been proposed to reach sustainable development. A great many of these strategies aim at one type of problem-preventing environmental deterioration-while ignoring the importance of economic or social goals. In addition, while political decisions are at the heart of the choices to be made, most researchers seem to consider sustainable development as a mere technical problem. In this paper we describe a more complete strategy for sustainable development. We use the outlines of this strategy to find out what knowledge and skills are still needed. The strategy is based on the idea that it is necessary to find consensus on the development of a socio-environmental system as a whole, and between all people involved. It leaves us with at least two main areas that need further study: the supply of information and the management of consensus building. A formal procedure for consensus building might be developed based on the literature and on experiences with Environmental Impact Assessments. Special attention is paid to the information needed. It can be summarized as information about: (1) delimiting a socio-environmental system; (2) the needs and wants to be satisfied via that system; and (3) the physical, ecological, economic, social and cultural constraints of satisfying those needs and wants.

TI Democratising the global economy by ecologicalising economics: The
   example of global warming
SO ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS

   warming; sustainability
ID ENVIRONMENT
AB The aim of this paper is to show that continued reliance on an unreconstructed neo-classical economic model for human progress is largely responsible for an economic development path which is both unsustainable and undemocratic. Using the topical issue of global warming as an illustration, it is argued that the ecologicalisation of the economics discipline challenges the foundations of this strategy and promises, among other benefits, a more democratic global economic organisation. The data analysed in this paper suggest that the damage of global warming is directly attributable to economic activity, the benefits of economic growth go to the economically articulate, and the disbenefits in terms of environmental damage are borne by the economically inarticulate. Mainstream economics gives no answer to, and becomes a method for evading, this moral problem. The data also show that huge increases in energy efficiency are required if a basically unchanged world economic system is to be sustainable. Nevertheless, the predominant goal of development policy is to ignore the problem of scale and to promote an economic model of urbanised development in the ''developing'' countries which carries the implication (and the promise) that the rates of resource consumption typical in ''developed'' countries can be achieved globally. An alternative development model is presented which includes the recognition that, in ecological terms, ''developed'' countries are in debt to ''developing'' countries, largely because of the way in which economic growth is measured gross of externalised social and environmental costs. A method is suggested for calculating part of this ecological debt for individual countries, thus going some way towards quantifying the extent of the distortions in the current global political economy and the unsustainability of the present economic order.

AB Statistical measures are needed to reveal at a glance how far (or near) various countries are to meeting the conditions of long-run sustainability, and how conditions are changing on a year-to-year basis (i.e., whether sustainability is being approached or not). The scheme proposed in this paper presents numerical comparisons of energy and materials use in the real world vis a vis an ideal case where all of the identifiable criteria for sustainability are satisfied. Apart from population stabilization, five general but quantifiable criteria for sustainability are suggested, including (1) stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere, (2) stabilization of acidity (pH) in rainfall, (3) reduction of dissipative uses, and wastes, of heavy metals to natural mobilization rates, or lower, (4) elimination of agriculture based on pumping ''fossil'' water from non-renewable aquifers and (5) elimination of loss of arable land because of salination or erosion. Other criteria, such as preservation of biodiversity and socio-economic equity between countries and generations might be added to the list. They introduce more difficult measurement problems, however, which are not considered further in the paper. Having fixed the list of criteria, the next step is to identify measures that either go to zero or unity, as the system approaches more and more closely to sustainability, at least in the limited sense defined above. Various types of measures of sustainability/unsustainability can be developed, viz. (i) measures of relative dependence of the economy on non-renewable sources of energy and materials, (ii) measures of the productivity of energy and materials consumed by the economic system and (iii) measures of dissipative loss, especially of toxic and hazardous substances. Specific examples of each type are discussed.

AB We manipulated, in accord with global-warming predictions, the thermal regime of a permanent first-order stream near Toronto, Ontario, Canada. We examined the effects of a 2-3.5 degrees C water-temperature increase on densities, biomass, species composition, and life histories of resident stream invertebrates. The stream was divided longitudinally at the source into two channels, one control and one experimental, and a before and after (BACI) design was employed such that one pre-manipulation year was followed by 2 yr of the temperature manipulation. Changes in the experimental channel following commencement of the manipulation included: (1) decreased total animal densities, particularly Chironomidae (Diptera); (2) earlier onset of adult insect emergence; (3) increased growth rates and precocious breeding in Hyalella azteca (Amphipoda); (4) smaller size at maturity for Nemoura trispinosa (Plecoptera) and H. azteca; and (5) altered sex ratios for Lepidostoma vernale (Trichoptera). These results partially corroborate previous laboratory and field studies. However, variation in the responses of individual target species to the manipulation was unexpected and may have been influenced by the genetic structure of local populations. We conclude that levels of gene flow among habitats may be critical to the degree of impact seen as a result of large-scale thermal perturbation (e.g., global warming).

AB There is a recognised need for an integrated approach to new professional challenges of sustainability, and for coordination of all environment-related subjects within the curriculum of The University of Melbourne, Faculty of Architecture and Planning. The new Environment Programmes developed during 1993 and started in 1994 will offer courses on the theory and practice of sustainable urban and architectural design, with an emphasis on bioclimatic urban and architectural design. In addition, the Programme will engage in research on the development of environment-responsive, regional approaches to urbanism and architecture in different parts of Australia, The Pacific region and throughout the world, implementing research results with practical design work. This paper presents: (i) the curriculum itself; (ii) the basic organisational and educational principles and ideas behind the course; (iii) its parallel programmes based on interdisciplinary and international collaboration, and (iv) describes an attitude to educate architects capable to contribute to the generation of a specific, environmentally generated regionalism in future Australian architecture. The Energy and Environmental Programme's curriculum was fully defined in December 1993, and gradually introduced during 1994. The first full undergraduate cycle started in 1995.

TI Architecture indigenous to extreme climates
SO ENERGY AND BUILDINGS

DT Article
DE environmental architecture; extreme climates
AB The term 'extreme' climates suggests that some climates have exaggerated characteristics in comparison with others that are more neutral and less extreme. By reducing the number of global climate zones to less than ten, a discipline of climatic description is forced that emphasizes their distinctive differences. Reviewed are the Arctic and Subarctic, and the maritime climatic zones. Simultaneously, indigenous architecture is examined as an indicator or telltale of climatic uniqueness, parallel to the use of vegetation types to define and distinguish biological climates. The snow igloo of the Inuit is examined in detail as both a constructive and operational environmental system. In comparison the Lapp winter hut or kata is also described. Although nominally examples of the temperate or maritime climate, the New England Cape Cod cottage is contrasted with the Hungarian village and house. A series of conclusions identify lessons from indigenous architecture appropriate to sustainability in industrial and post-industrial cultures.

AB Wetlands in India supply crucial human and animal needs such as drinking water, protein production, fodder, water purification, wildlife habitat, and flood storage. Increased appreciation of uses and threats is essential to protect wetlands where justified. Three quarters of India's population is rural, it places great demands on India's wetlands and losses continue to occur. This paper is based on extensive discussions with natural resource managers, government employees, farmers, academicians, and resource users at dozens of sites in India, as well as an extensive literature search. Twelve important kinds of wetland loss are identified and mechanisms believed to be causing them discussed: (1) agricultural conversion, (2) direct deforestation, (3) hydrologic alteration, (4) inundation, (5) defoliation, (6) altered upper watersheds, (7) accumulative water demands, (8) water quality degradation, (9) wetland consolidation, (10) global climate change, (11) ground-water depletion, (12) exotic species and biodiversity. Wetland understanding, management, and public awareness in India must continue growing if wetland resources are to remain functional.

TI Socially cooperative choices: An approach to achieving resource
   sustainability in the coastal zone
SO ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT

DT Article
DE behavioral solutions; cooperation; integration; mistrust; self-interest;
   social dilemmas
ID BRITISH-COLUMBIA; COMMONS
AB Achieving resource sustainability, particularly in the coastal zone, is complicated by a variety of interdependencies and trade-offs between economic, social, and ecological variables. Although trade-offs between each of these variables are important, this paper emphasizes the social components of resource management. In this regard a distinction is made between individual and cooperative choices. Individual choices frequently are made from a short-term, self-interested perspective, whereas cooperative choices are made from a long-term, community and resource-sustainability perspective. Typically, when presented with a spectrum of resource management decisions, individuals have a tendency to act in a self-interested manner. Thus, cooperative benefits, such as reduced conflict and improved resource certainty, are not realized. An overview of selected aspects of social dilemma theory suggests that socially cooperative choice outcomes are attainable in coastal zone management by integrating structural and behavioral solutions in resource use decision making. Three barriers to successful integration of structural and behavioral solutions are identified as self-interest, mistrust, and variable perceptions of resource amenities. Examples from coastal zone management indicate that these barriers may be overcome using approaches such as scope-reduction, co-management, community education, and local participation. The paper also provides comment on the potential benefits of integrating structural and behavioral solutions in international coastal zone management efforts.

AB Some methods used for the implementation of cleaner technology in slaughterhouses are mentioned and results based on Danish experience are described. It is stated that a combination of research and consultancy service has brought the Danish meat industry a long way towards a cleaner and sustainable meat production:
   More than 1 000 1 water were used in 1970 for slaughtering a pig and the equivalent figure was 340 1 in 1993. Similar results have been achieved for cattle where more than 2000 1 were used per animal in 1989 and only 950 1 in 1993. Large reductions in the BOD load were also found: 1 kg BOD per pig was released in 1980 and only 0.5 kg in 1993 whereas the corresponding figures for cattle were 4.0 kg in 1989 and 1.9 kg in 1994.
   It is emphasized that it generally pays to introduce cleaner technology solutions in a plant and that most investments have a short pay-back period. Cleaner technology is 80% common sense and 20% techniques.

TI Nutrition and the convention on the rights of the child
SO FOOD POLICY
LA English
DT Article
DE nutrition; rights; CRC
AB Nutrition is not a recognized right in any of the major international human rights instruments. Access to food, basic health services and adequate caring practices, however, are explicitly recognized as rights in the International Bill of Human Rights and other important human rights instruments, such as the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC). As food, health and care are all necessary, and in combination will ensure good nutrition, nutrition in this sense becomes a right. This paper describes the evolution of children's rights and how nutrition has become neglected. The CRC, which encompasses both civil and political rights and social, economic and cultural rights and thereby underlines the indivisibility of the international human rights system, provides a fun base for the promotion of nutrition as a right. The paper further emphasizes that development should ensure both a desirable outcome and an adequate process. Outcomes can be specified by goals, such as improved nutritional status of children. A high-quality process is characterized by a high degree of participation, community ownership, sustainability and empowerment. Outcome-focused strategies emphasize the achievement of goals; they are relatively easy to monitor, but often unsustainable. Process-focused strategies, on the other hand, emphasize participation and empowerment; they are difficult to monitor, and they often do not result in any significant outcome. Both outcome-focused and process-focused nutrition strategies alone should be avoided. A rights-based strategy combines the two positive extremes. Rights require the fulfilment of deontological criteria, inter alia a high quality process. Implementation, therefore, requires a holistic approach, which recognizes both the scientific and the ethical aspects of the problem at the theoretical as well as the practical level. A rights-based strategy goes beyond the fulfilment of needs because the state has obligations to respect, protect and fulfil these rights. A rights-based strategy for nutrition aims at the progressive achievement of nutritional goals and the progressive establishment of a high quality process in fulfilling these obligations.

DE human resource building; nutrition rights; human rights; training
AB The current focus on human development in general global development efforts carries with it a need for building human resources with appropriate intellectual, communicative and operational skills for use in analyses, decision-making and action at all levels, Human resource building extends beyond conventional disciplinary training and fosters the capability to work together to solve often complex problems for which each discipline does not alone have the answers, Human resources are needed to bridge the thinking and action between human rights and economic, social and cultural development, including food and nutrition improvements as human and social development goals and as human rights, This paper discusses the opportunities and prospects for human resource building for the promotion of nutrition rights as a mutual challenge for human rights lawyers and institutions and nutrition training institutions, The view is put forward that, while human resource building for nutrition rights is critical at the community and grass-roots levels, a commitment to appropriate programmes at academic institutions is needed to ensure the preparation of expertise as well as cadres, who can stimulate and backstop activities at these levels and within the civil society as a whole and ensure credibility and sustainability. The paper gives some examples of emerging and planned efforts to establish focused nutrition rights training and calls for a networking of like-minded institutions within the human rights and nutrition communities, for a strengthened performance and impact in training for further nutrition rights theory-building, standard-setting, assessment and promotion.

AB Consumers are becoming interested in the environmental impacts caused by the production, packaging and disposal of the products they purchase and consume. As a result, environmental certification of forest products and forestry practices, part of the more encompassing green movement, is proliferating globally. In response to these environmental concerns, some environmental organizations, retailers and wood products companies have developed a set of standards for wood products that are intended to encourage consumers to purchase wood originating from certified sustainable forests. These efforts are a response to the perception by the general public that most forest practices involving the harvesting of wood do irreversible damage to the environment.

SO FUTURES

DT Article
ID ECOLOGY; FLEXIBILITY; SYSTEMS; FIRM
AB In recent years, analogies taken from the natural world, and from evolutionary theory in particular, have been increasingly applied to problems outside the field of biology. The growing interest in issues of sustainability has not escaped this trend and the application of evolutionary analogies to issues of sustainability is discussed and its benefits outlined. Furthermore, a conceptual tool for addressing issues of sustainability within an evolutionary framework is presented and its main features investigated. There are, however, a number of reasons for caution when adopting any analogy for the purposes of theory development. These points of circumspection are investigated and a number of suggestions are made for enriching the framework to facilitate the application of evolutionary analogies to human-centred and other non-biological systems. This is achieved by recognizing the unique characteristics of human beings and interpreting the component factors of evolutionary theory so as to account for the fundamental differences between humans and other species.

DE CAMPFIRE; Zimbabwe; sustainable development; wildlife management;
   biodiversity; wildlife utilization
AB Zimbabwe is devolving substantial wildlife management responsibility to local government, and ultimately to local communities, through its Communal Areas Management Program for Indigenous Resources (CAMPFIRE) program. This paper's purpose is to explore the notion that CAMPFIRE offers a useful model for sustainable development discussions by examining the program's impacts in one case study location. It presents a legislative history of the CAMPFIRE Program before specifying the spatial criteria that explain ideal CAMPFIRE sites. Thereafter, it reports results from a study of the development impacts of locally controlled wildlife management in Masoka, an isolated CAMPFIRE community in the Zambezi Valley. The village has developed a land use plan, fenced its fields and settlements, reduced wild animal attacks on people and crops, provided access to primary education for both boys and girls, created local employment, and provided money for household food purchases during a severe drought. In Masoka, the implementation of CAMPFIRE seems to successfully provide incentives to protect megafauna and their habitats. For Masoka, CAMPFIRE has provided an alternative model to statist solutions emphasizing centralized control for biodiversity conservation purposes.

TI Electronic nautical charting: Economic value and role in sustainable

SO INTERNATIONAL HYDROGRAPHIC REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
AB Electronic nautical charting plays a major role in providing safe and efficient navigation of vessels primarily involved in commerce, fishery landings, marine recreation, cruises and research activities on the civil side, and naval operations for the military. In order to determine the contributions of electronic charting to marine transport operations, and the priorities for converting to electronic charts, this paper provides a general assessment of the economic value and importance of shipping operations in and out of U.S. ports including: foreign commerce, fishery landings, accidents, oil spills and military needs. This assessment will enable establishing priorities for electronic charts based on importance in serving U.S. Ports and U.S. Coast Guard Districts. Many accidents and spills are due to human error in ship navigation. In many cases these could be averted by using Electronic Nautical Charts (ENC) integrated with other navigation aids to provide features for collision/grounding avoidance. In its supporting role, ENC will help promote sustainable development of marine transport operations. In addition, ENC provides geodetically accurate coastal mapping data to serve as a reference base for Geographic Information Systems (GIS).

AB The concept of sustainable development should be familiar to those who have had to contend with development issues in the developing world. This concept first emerged in the latter part of the 1960s because of the increasing frustration felt by policy makers regarding the proliferation of failed grandiose and ambitious development programmes and abandoned 'white elephant' projects in Africa and other developing countries. Consequently, 'sustainable growth' was to form the cornerstone of development programmes. Gigantic 'white elephant projects' that often overshoot budgets and cease to be operational with the ending of development assistance were abandoned. However, the current broader understanding of sustainable development does have a very strong environmental theme. It is gradually becoming apparent that an unqualified growth, measured by increases in gross domestic product, which is then used as proxy for development is contradictory. Given the present situation where more than 1 billion people subsist in abject poverty, failing to attain the most basic fundamental human needs of shelter, food, clothes and decent living conditions, the need to achieve higher growth rates has never been more urgent. In particular, accelerating population growth and the attendant rural-urban migration are fast manifesting in rapid urbanization, chronic housing shortages, giant slums and proliferation of illegal settlements. However, recent evidence has shown that unless a balance is struck between growth and the ecosystem, future growth prospects could be seriously undermined. The ability of the earth to sustain all living species is defined by its 'carrying capacity'. Sustainable development is an imperative if we are to enhance and sustain this capacity. The almost everyday disasters such as drought, crop failure, soil erosion, desertification and famine that have engulfed Africa in recent years is an attestation to the need for an environmentally friendly development strategy. While environmental degradation has manifested in various forms, traceable to all facets of human existence, it is well established that more than 75% of the damage to the environment is traceable in one way or another to the built environment. Construction materials, household energy consumption, transportation and our life style do impact negatively on the environment. Considering, on the one hand, the level of poverty and population growth, and on the other, current and future demand on global resources, the need to strive for sustainable development in these countries cannot be overemphasized. The question that has largely been ignored is the capacity of the developing countries to embark on sustainable development, given the enormous exogenous influences bearing on them. This paper discusses the scope and limits of sustainable development in sub-Saharan Africa.

AB Sustainable development has become the conceptual framework within which societal, economic and environmental issues are addressed at every level around the world. In 1993, a United States-Canada assembly of more than 250 Great Lakes leaders was convened to evaluate the efficacy of creative processes under way in the Great Lakes Basin relative to sustainable development and to identify key success factors and process characteristics which are consistent with principles of sustainable development. A combination of eight criteria for effective project management (i.e. stakeholder involvement; leadership; information and interpretation; planning; human resource development; results and indicators; review and feedback; stakeholder satisfaction) and six principles of sustainable development (i.e. long-range planning and intergenerational responsibility; carrying capacity; anticipation and prevention; full cost accounting; integration of economic, social and environmental factors; efficiency, innovation and continuous improvement) were developed to evaluate and help improve decisionmaking processes. Such criteria and principles may be useful in improving decisionmaking processes in other parts of the world.

DE Moldova; economies in transition; erosion; water; energy; agriculture
AB In this paper, the state of sustainable development in Moldova is analysed. A descriptive analysis of economic, social and environmental landmarks in this newly independent republic of south-eastern Europe reveals a country with important agricultural and human potential hampered in its development by a process of economic transition, substandard capacity to manage the processes of technical change, climate change, threats to the environment and insufficient capacity for the creation of a development-strategy that will be sustainable over the long-term. The prospects for initiating sustainable development at the local level in the northern Moldovan village of Ishcalau are evaluated. A general framework for sustainable development projects in countries with economies in transition is described. Active involvement of local target groups during all phases of the project, capacity building, particular attention to the small-scale private sector, counteracting of existing environmental degradation and multi-level planning for sustainable development are identified as elements of critical importance. Within this framework, a local Agenda 21 based on ten priority areas for the initiation of a sustainable development project is defined and its main short- and medium-term results are described.

AB Problems and prospects of minor forest resource uses and management in three remote high elevation villages in the Indian Central Himalaya were studied. Of the 45 species constituting the minor forest product resource base, medicinal plants (14 species), wild edibles (ten species) and bamboos (four species) were important both for local use and for the rural economy. A range of tree species had fodder and organic manure value. The management practices differ in the government-owned forests and village community-owned forests. Local communities are more conscious of sustainable utilization of the forests they own and manage. Indirect economic benefits from forests were much higher than the direct benefits. The margin of profits to the villagers from minor forest resources could be improved by appropriate changes in the extraction, regeneration and marketing systems, together with improvement in traditional knowledge in terms of the industrial values of the products and empowerment of local communities.

AB Four main forces appear to be shaping urban growth and change at the end of the twentieth century: tertiarization, the shift from manufacturing to services; informationalization, the increasing use of information as the basis of the economy; the resulting locational disarticulation whereby command-and-control functions are carried out in places different from production locations; and constant innovation in both manufacturing and, increasingly, the generation and exchange of information. The result is a new urban hierarchy dominated by a few global cities. Their worldwide distribution depends a great deal on historical accident; there are fundamental and deep-seated differences between the urban hierarchies of North America, Europe, and Japan. But in all, higher-level urban development is concentrated into quite small axial belts: Boston-NewYork-Philadelphia-Baltimore-Washington, the Tokaido corridor of Japan, and the complex pattern of transport corridors connecting the major cities of North-West Europe. While on the macro scale there is increasing concentration into metropolitan areas and corridors, at the level of the individual metro area there is simultaneous dispersal of homes and jobs, which further increases journeys and poses challenges to sustainable urban development. Cities are just beginning to develop strategies to meet the resulting tension.

AB Nearshore coastal sand mining may adversely affect coastal development where extractions occur within the active beach-nearshore sand system. In this paper, the outer limits of the beach-nearshore system are reviewed, with the inclusion of new data from Pakiri, New Zealand. These include interpretation of nearshore sedimentology, morphology, bedforms and benthic fauna, theoretical estimates of sediment movement, historic evidence of beach-nearshore morphodynamics, measurement of the seaward extent of riphead plumes during or following storm wave conditions, and stratigraphic indications of seabed erosion and deposition. Convergent data indicate that the maximum limit of the modem beach-nearshore sand system occurs around the 25 m isobath on moderate to high energy beaches, on the east coast of Australia and New Zealand including Pakiri. The recent interpretations of the geomorphology of the Pakiri-Mangawhai sand system, within which shallow marine mining takes place, are re-examined in light of the results of this review. The conclusion that substantial onshore sediment exchange occurs between inner shelf and nearshore environments and that the Pakiri-Mangawhai sand system is therefore open to sediment inputs is not sustained. The results of investigations of bedforms, subtidal facies, historic morphodynamics and theoretical estimates of sediment transport thresholds, indicate that the nearshore-inner shelf boundary approximates the 25 m isobath at Pakiri. Significant sediment transport does not occur beyond this depth over the relevant time scales. A re-analysis of the beach profile records, as well as interpretation of barrier morphostratigraphy, indicates that, contrary to most previous interpretations, the Pakiri-Mangawhai coast shows no strong accretionary trend and is at best stable and possibly erosional. We hypothesize that the weak recovery of the Pakiri-Mangawhai coast following severe erosion in 1978 may be a consequence of sand mining. In the Pakiri-Mangawhai context, there is a high risk that nearshore coastal sand mining will adversely affect coastal processes and landforms.

AB A significant part of waste generation is caused by the building and construction industry. Reduction of construction waste is therefore a major topic of the integrated chain management policy of the Dutch government. Construction companies benefit from reduced waste generation by lower deposition costs and lower purchasing costs of virgin materials. An overview is presented of the main policy areas of the Dutch government concerning sustainability. Reducing the generation of construction waste fits into this policy. Subsequently, an overview is presented from construction-waste data available in literature. Then, the waste generation during several Dutch residential construction projects has been quantified and analyzed in detail. It follows that about 1-10% by weight of the purchased construction materials, depending on the material, leave the site as waste. Furthermore, the analyses identify additional sources of waste generation as those already known, such as a lack of attention paid to the sizes of the used products, lack of influence of contractors, and lack of knowledge about construction during design activities.

SO JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS

DT Article
DE creditworthiness; inflows
AB This paper studies the determinants and sustainability of the widespread private capital inflows to middle-income countries after 1989. The key question is whether these flows are mostly 'pulled' by attractive domestic conditions or 'pushed' by unfavorable conditions in developed countries. An analytical model focusing on country risk is developed and used empirically. It is argued that the observed improvement in country creditworthiness is mostly due to the decline in international interest rates, and that therefore its importance as a proximate cause does not support the 'pull' interpretation. All things considered, in most countries the key answer that emerges is 'push'.

AB This paper takes a critical look at the field of strategic human resource management and in particular the debate about the strategic value of the human resource. We identify the contribution as well as the problematic nature of the situational-contingency perspective. Drawing from the strategic management literature and the concept of resource heterogeneity, we then posit a resource-capability view of the firm and argue that the mutually reinforcing interaction between the stock of knowledge, skills and expertise (resources) and the organizational routines and human resource policies and practices (capabilities) generates human resource competencies whose strategic value is realizable to the extent that they are linked with core competencies. We thus offer a reconceptualization of human resource competencies which goes beyond existing trait, behavioural and systems approaches. Finally, we identify the circumstances surrounding the generation and distribution of rents arising from the utilization of human resource competencies by drawing from transaction cost theory and industrial relations.

AB There are numerous reports of nematicidal chemicals in crude plant homogenates, leachates, and decomposing residues. These compounds are usually assumed to be secondary metabolites, which serve as chemical defenses against disease and parasites. When such compounds are released into the rhizosphere, they are known as allelochemicals. The possibility exists to exploit allelochemicals for nematode control, and there have been many attempts to use this approach either by rotation, intercropping, or green manure treatments. Results have met with mixed success. Proof of allelochemical activity in field situations is difficult to obtain, but it is evident that some rotation crops are significantly better at reducing nematode populations than others. Rotations with non-host plants may simply deny the nematode population an adequate food source for reproduction (passive suppression), whereas allelopathic crops kill nematodes by the production of toxic compounds (active suppression). Progress toward sustainable agriculture should benefit from studies on allelopathic nematode control. However, grower acceptance of new plant-rotation strategies are based on economic and logistical considerations as well as efficacy. A potential practical application of allelopathic nematode control that involves using rapeseed as a green manure crop to reduce populations of Xiphinema americanum sensu lato in temperate orchards is presented.

TI Planning as sustainable development
SO JOURNAL OF PLANNING EDUCATION AND RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper makes the case that planning should fully incorporate the notion of sustainable development (SD) and argues that SD is nor achievable in any real way without attention to the substance and process of planning as ir happens on the ground. Sustainable development should be a fundamental principle of planning bur the concept is ambiguous. This paper distills a working definition of SD suitable for planners in terms of process and substantive criteria. The definition is derived mainly from an analysis of recent literature and shows that ecological sustainability is a necessary bur nor sufficient condition for sustainability and that social and economic conditions must also be met.
   The highest priorities in planning for SD are to ensure that plans address ecological issues and co improve decision-making processes ro achieve vertical consistency between actions ar local, national, and even international levels and horizontal coordination between development actions ac all levels. Despite the limited effectiveness of local decisions, there is so much that local communities can do for SD in their own interest and for the long-term benefit of the planet.

AB It is shown within a given framework that, with the world economy following an egalitarian path, the aggregate capital gains being positive is equivalent to the interest rate tending to decrease. This result is of importance for the concept of net national product in open economies. In particular, with positive aggregate capital gains, an open economy cannot sustain consuming the return on its capital stocks, since some part of the return must be used to augment the country's national wealth. It is established that a country's share of world-wide sustainable consumption equals its share of worldwide wealth.

AB Sustaining rangeland ecosystems is as much a social process as an ecological one, It requires application of many of the same principles as those used in planning for wildlife reserves, but the tenets of conservation biology need to be applied to conserve social as well as ecological structural elements and processes, For some rangelands, a crucial element in a sustainable, culturally meaningful, and ecologically rich landscape is ranching, which is at once a collection of ecological processes and interactions, and an expression of human community, Results of several surveys and studies are used to highlight the ''culture clashes'' that occur at the ecological and social edges of landscape elements, Unfortunately, differing expectations of what conserved areas should be like has hindered the creation of alliances between environmentalists and ranchers that might prevent the degradation of the landscape by uncontrolled residential and urban development, In one California case, successful planning and alliance building led to the conservation of ranchlands, Zoning, conservation easements, political and financial support for the livestock industry, community leadership, and recognition of the heritage value of rural lifeways all played a part in this success, Similar patterns have been noted in other parts of the West, To conserve some of the most productive and biodiverse rangeland landscapes, ranching must not just be tolerated as a means to an environmental end, but valued and planned for, ecologically, socially, and economically, Rangeland professionals have an important role to play in the development of sustainable social relationships that support sustainable rangelands.

AB Urban sustainability reporting is a tool for informing local government, as well as individuals, businesses, and other organizations, about the progress that they are making towards achieving urban sustainability. The reporting process starts with the definition of sustainability goals for the community, followed by a scoping stage. Subsequent steps comprise choosing a conceptual framework for reporting, preparing a list of potential sustainability indicators, evaluating them by a variety of criteria, choosing a final set of indicators, analyzing their results, presenting the results to an intended target audience, and then periodically assessing indicator performance.

ID CESIUM-137; SOIL
AB Many authors have indicated significant erosion in conjunction with grazing of sheep and rabbits in the semi-arid lands of Central Otago. Observations, however, have generally been based on subjective assessments influenced by vegetation depletion and proportions of bare ground. This paper quantifies net soil losses over the past 40 years using the radionuclide tracer caesium-137 (Cs-137). The study area was a ridge near Earnscleugh showing field evidence of surface erosion. Compared with a Cs-137 input of 275 Bq/m(2), analyses indicated a reduction in soil depth by 3.4 cm over 40 years from the sunny upper sideslope site. This corresponds approximately to an annual loss of 10.2 t/ha. The loss rate indicates that past land use was unsustainable. Net losses up to this value have affected approximately 24% of the local landscape. Conversely, there was net soil deposition on the shady upper sideslope and the sunny and shady footslope sites. Estimated gains in soil depth over 40 years range from 0.3 to 0.6 cm which correspond approximately to annual gains of 0.5 to 0.9 t/ha. A mean (N=10) contemporary topsoil thickness of less than about 8 cm infers net soil loss from the study area and this may apply to much of the Conroy land, system. Erosion and deposition is dominated by wind transport from north-westerly winds.

SO JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT-ASCE

ID AQUIFER
AB Geoelectric and well data are combined and used to delineate ''best'' well location areas. The best location is selected based on a compromise solution for two conflicting objectives: (1) maximum well yield (i.e., maximum sustainable pumping rate); and (2) maximum wellhead protection (i.e., maximum total travel time related to a fixed setback distance). The methodology combines hydraulic conductivities and layer thicknesses obtained from well logs, well-performance tests, and geoelectric measurements to estimate and map well yield and travel time. Hydraulic conductivities, layer thicknesses, and the estimated yields and total travel times are considered as spatially correlated random variables. Expected value and 75% reliability maps are developed for yield and total travel time. The best well location areas are identified based on a trade-off map that is calculated as a combination of the yield and travel time maps. The relative importance of well yield versus wellhead protection is incorporated in the trade-off relationship. The methodology is illustrated for a study area located near Ashland, Nebraska.

AB Social and cultural diversity coupled with the environmental complexity have developed magnitude of techniques and technologies regarding management of different sub-systems and have evolved different sets of approaches for natural resource-use. Indigenous peoples have the power to make decisions concerning the sustainable use and management of natural resources; this is governed by village committee/institutions. Such institutions could be strengthen providing adequate training and technical assistance to adapt their more traditional land-use systems to modem economic conditions. A meaningful development could be achieved only when culture and indigenous knowledge equalized with the ecological and economic developmental packages. Labour intensive techniques employed within the framework of modem appropriate technology can improve agricultural production in the area, high yields can be maintained and labour efficiency maximized. Finally, appropriate training in all cash fetching and market demanding articles/items could improve economic pool of the marginal peoples of the watershed.

TI Polyandry in a central himalayan community: An eco-cultural analysis
SO MAN IN INDIA
LA English
DT Article
AB Polyandry as a social institution has often been connoted as a cultural oddity or an ethnographic fossil in the evolution of family. In part, this view has resulted from a fragmented or isolated analytical frame work. This article, in contrast, takes a more holistic point of View to express the institution in its ecological, economic-and cultural perspectives through a study of the Jaunsaries, a Central Himalayan community of India. The Jaunsaries have undergone a number of classification and development changes. At present, the Jaunsaries are a scheduled tribe, and have been so since the Jaunsari-Bawar area was declared scheduled tribe area in 1967. This article begins with the analysis of the socio-economic situation of the Jaunsaries and identifies the role and influence of polyandry in their social development and economic sustainability.

TI Effects of vascularization on lymphocyte/tumor cell dynamics:

SO MATHEMATICAL AND COMPUTER MODELLING
LA English
DT Article
DE vascularization; tumor; lymphocyte; Hopf bifurcation; limit cycles
AB By adapting a pre-existing model to include the effects of vascularization within a tumor or multicell spheroid, a predator-prey system describing the cell populations of a solid tumor and reactive lymphocytes is formulated. The paper serves as a review of the minimal deterministic approach to tumor-host immune system interactions while examining, in a qualitative manner, the modifications to the dynamics induced by a simple representation of the vascularized tumor. In addition, the possibility of limit-cycle behavior is studied by regarding each of six parameters present in the model as a bifurcation parameter. Thus, in principle, well-defined and periodic oscillations in both lymphocyte and tumor cell populations may occur under appropriate circumstances; whether or not such oscillations are sustainable by the host, and their stability, amplitude and period depend on aquisition of more quantitative information concerning the relevant parameter ranges.

SO MYCORRHIZA
LA English
DT Article
DE arbuscular mycorrhiza; Citrus aurantifolia; cultural practices;
   agroecosystems
ID SOILS; FUNGI
AB Tecoman, in the Mexican state of Colima, had the world's greatest production of lime Citrus aurantifolia Swingle. Typical farming systems in the area include: (a) high-input monoculture, (b) a high-input system in which lime trees grow together with coconut palms, (c) a low-input system called ''Family Farms'' or ''Family Gardens''. In the Family Gardens, cultural practices are minimal and other fruit trees (about 16 species) coexist with the lime trees. This traditional minimal input system makes use of locally available resources and they are structurally very diverse. Arbuscular mycorrhizae may be crucial for sustainable production in Family Gardens. Root colonization and spore populations of fungi were scored at 2-week intervals in the three agroecosystems during a 6-month period. First samples were taken after the application of chemical fertilizer and irrigation in the high-input systems. Root colonization of lime was much higher and consistent in the low-input plots than in conventionally farmed plots, with colonization levels of 50-62% that remained the same throughout the sampling time; the high-input systems showed a high variation and lower level of colonization, 36% and 27% in associated and monoculture systems, respectively. Spore abundance was higher in the high-input systems but showed constant variation. The results suggest a strong effect of agroecosystem on mycorrhizal colonization of lime roots.

SO OUTLOOK ON AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
AB Relatively few small-scale farmers culture fish, even in Asia, as the gap between the traditional supply - wild fish - and the demand has begun to widen only relatively recently. Rapid human population growth, overfishing and environmental degradation are providing a stimulus for the growth of aquaculture but sustainable systems of production remain to be developed for most areas. A balanced model involving both on-farm and off-farm resources is required to promote aquaculture so that it can fulfil its potential and contribute significantly to people's welfare, Rising expectations and the poor resource base of most small-scale farms dictate the need to intensify nutrient flows and productivity through increased levels of off-farm inputs, as outlined here for resource-poor northeast Thailand.

In this area, which has considerable agricultural and hydrological potential, various irrigation projects are in development, in almost all cases without being based upon systematic soil studies. Five environments were identified: lowlands; terraces; platforms located above the terraces; tableland areas; and dissected areas, each one with its set of characteristic soils. The crucial factors acting in the pedogenetic processes in these conditions are the parent material and the relief, which, considered in an integrated way, explain the characteristics and properties of the soil classes. The color, texture and cohesion degree are consequence of those factors and co-vary with diverse soil properties, allowing, in this manner, their utilization for a secure and efficient transfer of knowledge to similar systems.

AB Although environmental protection is nor specifically mentioned in the Charter of the United Nations? the organization has perforce become the leading catalyst for and coordinator of activities in this field. The UN Conference on the Environment (Stockholm, 1972) and the UN Conference on the Environment and Development (Rio de Janeiro, 1992) adopted principles and recommendations that have guided the environmental protection activities of the UN and individual stares. This paper analyses the role of the UN in developing and executing international environmental law, particularly in the areas of the marine environment, pollution of fresh water, degradation of the atmosphere, biodiversity and desertification. The work of the UN Environment Programme and the UN Commission on Sustainable Development receive special attention. Finally, the problems of 'treaty congestion', the lack of an overall framework for regulating human/environment interactions, and adequate financing of environmental programmes are discussed.

AB A hybrid genetic algorithm is used to schedule tasks for a satellite that can be modeled as a robot whose goal is to retrieve objects from a two-dimensional field. The objective is to find a schedule that maximizes the value of objects retrieved. Typical of the real-world tasks to which this corresponds is the scheduling of ground contacts for a communications satellite. An important feature of our application is that the amount of time available for running the scheduler is not necessarily known in advance. This requires that the scheduler produce reasonably good results after a short period, but that it also continue to improve its results if allowed to run for a longer period. We satisfy this requirement by developing what we call a sustainable genetic algorithm.

AB Nuisance cyanobacterial blooms are an important environmental problem. Toxins released by cyanobacteria can kill animals and cause illness in humans. The sustainable management of toxic cyanobacteria would increase the conservation and amenity value of affected water bodies, and decrease on-site water treatment costs. Methods are available to kill or to prevent blooms but often the expense is prohibitive or the agent used is detrimental to desirable lake organisms. Different management strategies are therefore considered within the context of the current state of the UK water industry. Particular reference is made to the potential impact of the 1994 Ofwat-determined water-price increase limits on environmental policy and prioritization.

AB Biodiversity is a precious source for modern biotechnology. It is a source which potentially holds innovative and sustainable solutions to a broad range of important problems for modern society. Improved cooperation between the natural product chemists and the microbiologists is an important step forward for speeding up the process of evaluating these potentialities. Further, microbiologists and natural product chemists in tropical countries, with the richest flora and fauna placed right at their door step have a very central position. They are essential for building up international scientific cooperation, with the objective of expanding our understanding of biological and biochemical diversity, and based on this bringing forward more biological solutions. The entire process should build on a principle of fairness and equity in sharing of the benefits and respecting the State's sovereign right to its own resources.

AB The analysis show how the Swedish iron ore producer, LKAB, in spite of mining its ore underground in an arctic climate at relatively high costs, has remained internationally competitive thanks to its large-scale operation with high grade magnetite ore, pelletization and relatively short distance to both its shipping harbour and its international markets. LKAB starts at a relatively high level on the supply curve with respect to mining costs, but as the analysis continues to describe, LKAB moves gradually downwards on the supply curve on delivered pellet costs. The analysis clearly shows that LKAB has successfully managed to find its comparative advantage and that its competitive strength is sustainable, primarily thanks to its rich deposits of magnetite ore.

AB Though sustainable development is a relatively recent addition to the public lexicon, concern that resource depletion may threaten the welfare of future generations dates back at least to Thomas Malthus and other classical economists writing nearly two centuries ago, Today the debate over this threat not only continues, but seems more polarized than ever, In one school are the concerned, often ecologists and other scientists and engineers, who contend the earth cannot for long continue to support current and anticipated levels of demand for oil and other exhaustible resources, In the opposing school are the unconcerned, often economists, who claim with equal conviction that the earth with the help of market incentives, appropriate public policies, and new technology can amply provide for society's needs for the indefinite future, That intelligent and informed individuals remain so divided on such an important issue for the future of humanity after years of debate is surprising, The explanation, at least in part, appears to lie with the very different paradigms adopted by the two different groups coupled with quite contrasting views on the beneficence of technology, public policy and the marketplace, The two competing paradigms lead to quite different outlooks on the human condition and in turn on recommendations for public policy.

DE Senegal; cotton; compost pens; periurban milk belt; cash flow; economic
   analysis
AB Compost pens are promoted since 1985 in the Senegalese cotton area and they have a good expansion thanks to their diversified products and their integrative influence on crop and livestock production. This study was conducted on 13 farms from January to may 1994 in the Tambacounda area. It gives more information on the adaptation settings of the compost pens and their production and marketing advantages for a peri-urban milk belt. Analyses on milk activity show a positive cash flow and opportunity cost pricing of consumed milk and manure gives interesting margins. The promotion of peri-urban milk belts based on compost pens has a good future in a post devaluation setting. The sustainability and expansion of the system is greatly influenced by the pricing policy of cotton by-products by the developement agency promoting the technology.

TI Intellectual property in international relations - Technology transfer
SO SCIENCE COMMUNICATION
LA English
DT Article
AB This article explores how the integration of intellectual property in international relations could facilitate the transfer of technology from the North to the South. The role of technical and development cooperation among countries is imperative to international relations. international relations enhance cooperation among countries and make possible the inflow and outflow of capital goods and services among cooperating countries. Today, people think about the North as having control over advanced technologies revolving around intellectual property, which deals with specialized issues and which is governed by such specialized branches of law as industrial property law and copyright law Considering the fact that issues pertaining to technologies are invariably an integral part of any policy designed to achieve sustainable development at all levels, integrating intellectual property discussion in international relations could facilitate acquisition of expired patents by developing countries for accelerated expansion of their social construction.

AB Information technology will greatly influence the quality of life in the 21st century. The challenge is to use the technology to help overcome numerous global, regional, and local problems that threaten the quality of life. These problems include global overpopulation, intense and potentially socioeconomically destructive global economic competition, continued pressures on the global environment, increasing levels of regionalized armed conflicts, regional water shortages and other regional environmental problems, and local transportation congestion, poverty, crime, and drug abuse. Social scientists must become aggressively involved and accept leadership roles in the conceptualization, development, and implementation of computer-based systems that have broad social impact.

DE fertility parameters; inland valleys; intense leaching; intense
   weathering; West Africa
AB In an effort to improve the critical food situation in West Africa, wetlands are currently receiving the necessary attention as the environment most suitable for rice production. Various scientific studies are required to effectively put these wetlands into sustainable crop production. Between 1983 and 1989 inland valleys (IVs) of West Africa were surveyed with the main objective of characterizing these soils; soil samples were therefore collected from these IVs throughout the various climatic zones.
   As inland valleys of West Africa have undergone intense leaching and weathering, the soil pH is generally low. Mean soil pH values (0-15 cm) are: West Africa, 5.3; Equatorial forest (EF), 5.3; Guinea savanna (GS), 5.3; Sudan savanna (SuS), 5.9; and Sahel savanna (SS), 6.0. Exchangeable cations for West Africa IVs are ion:; also low for IVs of EF; very low for GS IVs; and moderate for the drier zones (SuS and SS), Total carbon and nitrogen contents (12.8 g kg(-1) C and 1.11 g kg(-1) N) of these soils are low for West Africa in general, moderate for EF (20.4 g kg(-1) C and 1.66 g kg(-1) N), and very low for the three savanna zones. Mean values of available phosphorus suggest that the phosphorus status of these soils is low (West Africa and EF) to very low (GS, SuS, and SS) throughout the region. This study revealed that most of the soils of IVs of West Africa are characteristically low in plant nutrients. For effective and sustainable crop production, farming systems that are both soil restoring and enriching need to be developed.

AB This paper represents the text of the obligatory talk given by the author on receipt of the 1995 Jay Wright Forrester Award for his book titled ''Towards Sustainable Development, Essays on System Analysis of National Policy.'' The paper documents methodological and problem-related insights created over the course of an extended research effort that yielded the essays of the book. The methodological principles elaborated include the use of a diverse data base for model development, the partitioning of a complex problem into tractable parts and the process of building confidence in a model. The problem-related insights cover the concept of economic value, its diverse manifestations and their implications for sustainable development. An attempt is made to extend the concepts learnt to the global economic system and research agendas are outlined for addressing the problems of global sustenance.

AB This paper discusses recent regulatory and legislative changes affecting competition in local network distribution services in Canada. It highlights reliance upon vague or inappropriate criteria such as 'fair' and 'sustainable' competition, as well as the overwhelming importance policy-makers place on cultural nationalism in shaping major recent policy initiatives. The paper argues that the outcome of recent policies will likely be disappointing in terms of stimulating efficient competition and cautions policy-makers elsewhere to resist appeals by interested parties to adopt similar criteria.

AB The Convention on Biological Diversity provides an international legal framework and multilateral mechanism for the exchange of genetic materials and conservation of biodiversity. The Convention recognizes the sovereign rights of states over their natural resources, and the authority to determine access. The research agreements and legal contracts must address the needs of indigenous people, community rights, sustainable methods of sample collection, compensation and intellectual property issues. Implementation of the articles of the treaty requires not only the formulation of legal agreements and contracts, but also the establishment of meaningful and just collaborations, and functional partnerships between industrialized nations and source countries.

AB Grazing lands constitute a major source of consumable products and a wealth of natural resource values for society. These resources are under pressure to feed the masses, protect biodiversity, manage for multiple sustained values and provide a standard of living for the holder of the land. Emerging challenges to management of grazing lands acid guidance as to opportunities to address the complexity of land management for both on- and off-site values are discussed. The basic premise focuses on the importance of developing information infrastructures which link the producer, non-governmental organisations, scientists, action agency personnel and interested lay persons concerned about management of and multiple products/values derived from grazing lands, Establishment of communication infrastructures by government and industry is critical to providing linkages to biological, economic and social information needed to move environmental issues out of the realm of emotionalism to a more rational decision making environment. At issue is the creation of information infrastructures capable of linking major stakeholders with data, spatial images, analytical tools and expertise. Improved information systems should link knowledge seekers with knowledge creators, resulting in more focused science, and technology transfer being targeted for issues which enhance sustainability of our global sating resources.

AB Emphasis in management and research for tropical grasslands has focussed on increasing productivity via the addition of new plants, animals or energy to native systems. The criterion for success was economic performance. However, public expectations and a more thorough understanding of ecosystem dynamics, have redefined the goals of land management. In this paper, we identify temporal and spatial variability as the primary constraints to sustainable land management in tropical grasslands and provide experimental evidence to suggest that an enhanced understanding of key ecological processes is central to achieving sustainability.

AB This study demonstrates how analysis of new British Census data (the Samples of Anonymised Records) may enhance other data sets for transport and planning purposes. The study uses logistic regression with categorical and dichotomous socio-economic independent variables to investigate access to cars amongst the elderly population in Sheffield. The method can be applied to any UK metropolitan or county area. The conclusions have implications for policies on sustainable transport and social integration.

AB Ian Barbour in the second volume of his Gifford Lectures makes a significant contribution to environmental ethics. Worthy of scrutiny are his views on the relation of technology to the environment, on the distinction between nature and culture, on the problem of hierarchical thinking, and on the notion of sustainability. His integrated approach is a model for how we must relate to nature.

DE environmental ethics; politics; process philosophy; sustainability;
   technology
AB Both Roger Shinn and Robert Stivers ask whether technology has a momentum of its own that is difficult if not impossible to control (''autonomous technology'' or ''technological inevitability''). I reply that the difficulty in controlling technology is a product of economic and political institutions (such as corporate lobbying and campaign contributions) rather than of any inherent characteristics of technology. Against Stivers's assertion that the ecosystem should be the center of value in environmental ethics, I defend the process view that all beings are valuable, but they are not equally valuable in their richness of experience or their contribution to the experience of others. I also consider his caveats about ambiguities in the concept of sustainability. Two questions raised by Mary Gerhart are taken up: the difficulties of interdisciplinary writing and the role of theological ethics in discussions of public policy. In dialogue with Frederick Ferre I explore the role of alternative visions of the good life as a source of social change. In the face of diminished concern about social justice and environmental sustainability among citizens and in Congress since the book was written, I express long-range hope, but not optimism about the short-term prospects for change.

AB THE functioning and sustainability of ecosystems may depend on their biological diversity(1-8). Elton's(9) hypothesis that more diverse ecosystems are more stable has received much attention(1,3,6,7,10-14), but Darwin's proposal(6,15) that more diverse plant communities are more productive, and the related conjectures(4,5,16,17) that they have lower nutrient losses and more sustainable soils, are less well studied(4-6,8,17,18). Here we use a well-replicated field experiment, in which species diversity was directly controlled, to show that ecosystem productivity in 147 grassland plots increased significantly with plant biodiversity, Moreover, the main limiting nutrient, soil mineral nitrogen, was utilized more completely when there was a greater diversity of species, leading to lower leaching loss of nitrogen from these ecosystems. Similarly, in nearby native grassland, plant productivity and soil nitrogen utilization increased with increasing plant species richness. This supports the diversity-productivity and diversity-sustainability hypotheses. Our results demonstrate that the loss of species threatens ecosystem functioning and sustainability.

AB Because of the dietary and financial importance of fisheries resources in many African countries, concerns have been expressed regarding the potential for adverse impacts to fisheries resources from climate change, and a need has been identified for assessment tools that can evaluate the potential for impacts in a timely and cost-effective manner. This paper presents a framework and set of methods for assessing the potential effects of climate change on fisheries resources in Africa. The framework identifies the need to first link predicted climate changes to changes in the aquatic environment, and only then can potential impacts to aquatic resources be evaluated. The approach developed for Africa was constrained by several factors, including availability of existing data and assessment technologies, and the need for a rapid evaluation of potential climate impacts. The assessment approach employs a variety of methods including empirical models which predict changes in mortality, maximum sustainable yield, and yearly catch, a bioenergetics model, and a habitat suitability model Previously developed or newly derived site-specific empirical models can be used to compare mortality, yield, and annual catch estimates among historic, current, and predicted climate conditions. Similarly, bioenergetics modeling can be used to compare growth rates and biomass production among different climate conditions. Habitat suitability models can be developed for current climate conditions, and the effects of changes in climate-driven habitat variables such as water depth, temperature, and current velocity on habitat suitability can be evaluated for different climate conditions. Use of these approaches is recommended because they can utilize existing ecological data and do not require extensive new data collection activities, they are not technologically complex, and they can provide evaluations of potential climate change impacts in a timely and cost-effective manner.

AB The possibility for supplying Earth with abundant clean energy imported from space has been appreciated for many years. Much solid work has taken place on studies and technology demonstrations, the results of which have persuaded many that this concept is the enabler for a sustainable energy future. As with any new large-scale technology, however, valid questions can be raised and it is timely to determine whether power from space is needed for the Earth and if the approach suggested by its advocates is sound.
   The purpose of this paper is to establish a framework for determining this need and soundness of approach. The method used is to frame key questions and for each question, suggest what is known, what is unknown or controversial, and what actions would be helpful to expand what is known and to shrink the domain of uncertainty. ?he questions are: is power from space technically feasible?, is it needed to meet the demand for energy, is it needed on environmental grounds?, is it safe?, and, can it be cost competitive?
   If power from space is needed and the approach is indeed determined to be sound, then serious work to lay the foundation for actual implementation should commence. Dr. Glaser proposed a set of ''Terraces'' along which technical progress might proceed. This paper amplifies the terracing notion, extending it into the implementation dimension, and suggests additional actions to promote power from space as an energy option to meet a pressing human need.

AB Following rapid industrialization in China, traditional integrated-farming techniques are being lost before their potentials have been properly assessed. South of Canton, organic farming and waste recycling have been practiced for centuries in a dike-pond system, which still offers sustainable income opportunities and a multiple-crop yield which is, per area, among the highest in the world. Within the system, leakage of nutrients and the use of chemicals are minimized. A study of the dike-pond concept points at simple ways to reduce unfavorable environmental impacts of food production.

AB The conservation community is faced with the need for protected areas to attract public and political support. It needs to be shown that the contribution of protected areas to society is relevant and important. This article assesses the promotion of human health facilitated by the opportunities created by the presence of a national park, and the contribution of such protected areas to the health of the community. A case study approach has been adopted. The observed improvements in the living conditions of the communities neighboring the Serra da Capivara National Park, Brazil, have arisen from the need to conserve the local natural and cultural heritage. It is suggested that the interrelationship between health and conservation can enable local communities to sustain their living and increase their commitment to neighboring protected areas.

AB Attempts to generate a ''climate-responsive'' northern urban form are part of a relatively recent phenomenon and field of investigation. In conjunction with the international ''winter cities'' movement, the need has been established for explicit, systematic inquiry directed toward national and local action to improve the comfort and lifestyles of all northern inhabitants. It is important to recognize that winter-induced discomforts exist and that they must be acknowledged in planning theory and practice.
   For northern cities to function more satisfactorily, the negative impacts of winter must be reduced while its beneficial characteristics are enhanced. While not all summer activities can or should be abandoned during winter, proper micro-climatic control is essential if human life is to be retained outside. The outdoor season should be extended since so much indoor isolation occurs. The main principles to be incorporated in exemplary ''winter city'' design should be contact with nature, year-round usability, user participation, cultural continuity, and the creation of comfortable micro-climatic conditions throughout much of the city's open spaces. All valuable sources of inspiration must be harnessed in the attempt to mediate between organic regionalism and internationalism, on the one hand, and romanticism and pragmatic realism, on the other. Creating optimum conditions for human well-being, habitation, work and intellectual development in each of the four seasons is vital under harsh environments. Adopting a climate-sensitive approach to planning policy and urban design can render everyday life less stressful, especially during the lengthy winter periods found in many northern latitude and high altitude settings.

AB Background. Liaison meetings between psychiatrists and general practitioners are now well established. Much has been written about their purpose and structure but little about their content.
   Aim. A study aimed to describe the clinical focus of meetings between a community mental health team and general practitioners and the nature of the professionals' interactions.
   Method. Audiotapes of six consecutive monthly meetings between a community mental health team and general practitioners in two general practices were analysed.
   Results. Attendance rates among professionals were over 70%. Over 90% of discussion time was focused on patient-centred clinical matters. Almost two thirds of interactions were focused on patients receiving ongoing joint care; few interactions were devoted to new referrals or to patients who had not been assessed. Psychotic patients, although accounting for 15% of referrals, occupied 54% of patient-centred discussion time. Most interactions consisted of reciprocal information exchange between members of the community mental health team and general practitioners.
   Conclusion. The high attendance rates indicate that both general practitioners and community mental health team members considered these meetings as high priority The steady move towards management of severely ill psychiatric patients in the community rather than in hospital requires close collaboration between primary and secondary care teams. The meetings described in this paper appear to be a simple, manageable and sustainable response to this need.

AB The influence of nitrogen (N) fertilizers, especially anhydrous ammonia, on soil quality has been questioned frequently by proponents of organic farming and low input sustainable agriculture. A 10-yr experiment was conducted on an Orthic Dark Brown Chemozemic loam, at Scott, Saskatchewan, to examine the influence of urea and anhydrous ammonia, at rates of N up to 180 kg ha(-1), on yields of cereals and oilseeds. In the 10th yr, we sampled soil from the 0- to 7.5- and 7.5- to 15-cm depths of each treatment 3 d before and 6 and 26 d after fertilization to assess the impact of applied N on microbial populations and soil biochemical properties. The long-term residual effects of N fertilization on soil properties were evident prior to the 10th annual N application. The short-term effects were most pronounced 6 d after the 10th N application. Generally, effects were greater in the 7.5- to 15-cm depth, where N was placed. The soil, which was already acidic (pH = 5.2 in 0.01 M CaCl2), decreased in pH in proportion to N rate and more so for anhydrous ammonia than urea. Generally, fungal and bacterial populations (plate counts) were positively related to N rate and were greater in soil treated with anhydrous ammonia than in urea-treated soil. In contrast, the actinomycete population was inversely related to N rate and was less for anhydrous ammonia than for urea. Nitrifier counts were increased by low rates of N (added substrate) but were similar to the check at high N rates (high acidity). There were no significant effects of N treatment on denitrifiers or yeasts. In contrast to the plate count results, microbial biomass decreased with increasing rates of N and was lower for anhydrous ammonia than for urea. However, the authenticity of this response is questionable because the fumigation-incubation method of biomass determination is compromised under acid conditions. Carbon mineralization was unaffected but N mineralization and nitrification tended to decrease at the 180 kg N ha(-1) rate of anhydrous ammonia. Significant nitrification occurred at pH < 5.0 suggesting possible adaptation of nitrifiers in this acid soil. Wet aggregate stability (WAS) was unaffected by N treatments. We concluded that, if producers in the Dark Brown soil zone apply fertilizers at rates less than 90 kg N ha(-1), deterioration of soil quality should be minimal.

AB The future is open, therefore it is impossible to predict correctly what is to come. Nevertheless, we have expectations about the future because man has got the experience that substantial trends, which have their origin in the past, will continue. This means, from the view of natural sciences, the fundamental laws of physics and chemistry set a frame also for the time to come. First of all, the conservation theorems and the principle ot dissipation of energy and matter set boundaries to our activities.
   From this assertion the existence of quantitative limits of growth and limits of population capacity on earth is deduced. These limits are dynamic quantities whish depend on many variables, particularly on human behaviour. Within the given boundaries it is possible to establish a sustainable society Man himself is responsible for his future.

ID IIASA ENERGY SCENARIOS; PROGRAM
AB The history of the U.S. Global Change Research Program calls into question its sustainability. The Program was established on the presumption that a prerequisite for rational, comprehensive, and cost-effective policy responses is the reduction of scientific uncertainty through comprehensive predictive models. This presumption remains a significant barrier to the renewal of public support for the Program through near-term progress consistent with its mandate 'to produce information readily usable by policymakers'. This article critiques the use of comprehensive predictive models for policy purposes; proposes one modest alternative to comprehensive predictive models as a means of integrating scientific and non-scientific considerations into recommendations readily usable by policymakers; and places the issue In the broader context of a paradigm shift in U.S. science and technology policy, The purpose is to expedite progress, consistent with the policy mandate, that would help sustain public support for the Program.

AB The dynamics of a remnant population of the palm Neodypsis decaryi were characterized using a linear stage-structured demographic model. This palm is a threatened keystone species restricted to a narrow ecological zone in southeastern Madagascar. The population showed high mortality rates in the early stages of the life cycle, followed by a period of lower adult mortality. Demographic, results indicated that the population was either stable or increasing inside the reserve (lambda(m) close to 1.0). Sensitivity and elasticity analyses indicated that adult stage classes were the most sensitive to producing changes in population growth rates . Continued biological monitoring is appropriate for the long-term conservation management of this palm inside the reserve. Outside the protected area the population appears to be declining rapidly;mainly because of anthropogenic effects (especially fire and grazing). If the conservation of Neodypsis decaryi is to be successful In the long term, then conservation methods must be carried oat in cooperation with local villagers, and the species should be managed as a renewable resource in situ and ex situ. In situ conservation should include nlltivntiolz of this species throughout its natural range and protection of the existing viable natural populations. Alternative conservation management practices, both ecologically and economically, sustainable, may be useful to alleviate the human pressures on this renewable resource. If leaves of N. decaryi are to be harvested by local people, we recommend restricting annual harvesting to about 25% of leaves per tree per year, Based on sensitivity analysis, seed collection should be kept well below 95% of the yearly crop if harvesting is not to have a significant impact on population growth rates.

AB Although palms are the most commonly harvested tree family in the world, they are susceptible to overexploitation, and many harvest schemes are not sustainable. We assessed the impact of leaf harvesting of the Asian palm, Livistona rotundifolia, in North Sulawesi, Indonesia, to determine the effect of harvest intensity on subsequent growth and to determine if current harvest practices are ecologically sustainable. We conducted experimental harvests of two intensities and compared results with a control. Leaf emergence, expansion, opening, and maturation were monitored for I year. Leaves in heavy and light harvest treatments grew and opened significantly faster than control leaves. Final leaf size was a function of harvest intensity: control of leaves were larger (4.O6m) than light-harvest leaves (3.62 m) and heavy-harvest leaves (2.62 m). Census results for palms in harvested and unharvested nl ens indicated that palm density was twice as high and reproductive-sized palms were 10 times more common in the unharvested area. We judged current harvest practices to be nonsustainable. Recommendations for sustainable harvesting include reduction of harvest intensity and waste and preservation of reproductive-sized palms.

AB An analysis of 350 users of Norplant contraceptive subdermal implants from six centers in two African countries (Ghana and Nigeria) indicates that method acceptability remained high among the women who used the method for five years. Overall, 90.1% of the 155 five-year users in these countries reported having a very favorable experience and 9.9% a favorable experience with Norplant implants. Ease of use was cited by 56.1% and duration of use by 23.6% of the women as the mast liked characteristics of the method at study completion after live years. Menstrual disturbance was the least liked aspect, by 42.9% of the women. On average, women who discontinued early from the study had fewer living children and were more likely to desire additional children at method adoption than those who completed five years of use; the differences were statistically significant. Differences in level of education and previous use of contraception were not found to be statistically significant between completers and non-completers. Differences in age were not significant in Nigeria, but were marginally significant in Ghana, with completers being older than non-completers. Of the clients who completed this study, 79.2% indicated a desire to continue with contraception and 43.9% planned to have a second set of implants inserted. These findings have important implications for counseling, method access and service sustainability in African countries.

ID WATER
AB Compensatory mitigation for damages to wetlands in the United States occurs largely without explicit analysis and replacement of wetland functions. We offer an approach to standardize such analyses and strengthen the connection between ecological principles and policies for wetland resources. By establishing standards from reference wetlands chosen for their high level of sustainable functioning, gains and losses of functions can be quantified for wetlands used in compensatory mitigation. Advantages of a reference wetland approach include (1) making explicit the goals of compensatory mitigation through identification of reference standards from data that typify sustainable conditions in a region, (2) providing templates to which restored and created wetlands can be designed, and (3) establishing a framework whereby a decline in functions resulting from adverse impacts or a recovery of functions following restoration can be estimated both for a single project and over a larger area accumulated over time.
   To establish reference standards, conditions inherent to highly functioning sites must be identified for classes of wetlands that share similar geomorphic settings. Ecological functions are then identified, and variables used to model the functions are employed in developing reference standards. Variables range from the highest levels of sustainable functioning to the complete absence of functions when a wetland ecosystem is displaced. An example given for wet pine flats in the North Carolina coastal plain illustrates how to determine the loss of a given function for an impacted wetland, how to calculate recovery (gains) in function through compensatory mitigation, and how to use the relationships between the two (loss vs. gain in function) to set minimum replacement ratios of restored to impacted area. In all cases, data from reference wetlands provide the benchmarks for making these estimates and for directing restoration or creation of wetlands toward the standards established for the wetland class. Programs to implement the use of reference wetlands require regional efforts that build upon the knowledge base of existing wetlands and their functioning.

AB The creation and restoration of new wetlands for mitigation of lost wetland habitat is a newly developing science/technology that is still seeking to define and achieve success of these wetlands. Fundamental requirements for achieving success of wetland creation and restoration projects are: understanding wetland function; giving the system time; and allowing for the self-designing capacity of nature. Mitigation projects involving freshwater marshes should require enough time, closer to 15-20 yr than 5 yr, to judge the success or lack thereof, Restoration and creation of forested wetlands, coastal wetlands, or peatlands may require even more time. Ecosystem-level research and ecosystem modelling development may provide guidance on when created and restored wetlands can be expected to comply with criteria that measure their success. Full-scale experimentation is now beginning to increase our understanding of wetland function at the larger spatial scales and longer time scales than those of most ecological experiments. Predictive ecological modelling may enable ecologists to estimate how long it will take the mitigation wetland to achieve steady state.

AB To produce reliable estimates of the size or vital rates of a given population, it is important that the boundaries of the population under study are clearly defined. This is particularly critical for large, migratory animals where levels of sustainable harvest are based on these estimates, and where small errors may have serious long-term consequences for the population. Once populations are delineated, rates of exchange between adjacent populations can be determined and accounted/corrected for when calculating abundance (e.g., based on mark-recapture data). Using satellite radio-collar locations for polar bears in the western Canadian Arctic, we illustrate one approach to delineating wildlife populations that integrates cluster analysis methods for determining group membership with home range plotting procedures to define spatial utilization. This approach is flexible with respect to the specific procedures used and provides an objective and quantitative basis for defining population boundaries.

ID POLICY
AB Conservationist arguments for international trade restrictions on tropical hardwoods, along with counter-arguments by the wood industry, are both based on the claim that key hardwoods, like mahogany, can be either sustainably managed in their natural forest habitat or sustainably produced in silvicultural settings. This paper examines the financial feasibility of three mahogany planting regimes found among small-scale family farmers in the Brazilian Amazon State of Rondonia: degraded fallow enrichment, agroforest consorciation (e.g., mahogany and coffee), and pure-stand plantation. The sensitivity of net future and present values from each of the three systems to changes in real interest rate of capital, opportunity cost of labor, production time, seedling survival rate, and producer roundwood price was tested under 10 scenarios, Overall, mahogany production was found to be financially viable in 21 of the 30 alternative scenarios considered, with pure-stand plantations offering the most profitable alternative, Based on financial criteria alone the most promising approach to blending tropical timber trade with natural forest conservation would be through mahogany plantations, especially if they are located outside the tropical forest zone of the Amazon region.

TI A comparative assessment of the energy and carbon balance of utilizing
   straw
SO ENERGY
LA English
DT Article
AB There has been a recent growth of interest in the potential for using straw as an energy source to generate electricity and/or heat. The energy balance of this process is important as a measure of the sustainability of such an activity, while the CO2 emitted and that saved by offsetting the need to produce energy by other means are also important, given the U.K.'s obligations to reduce CO2 emissions. An existing methodology is adopted to calculate estimates of primary energy inputs and CO2 outputs. Results of calculations are presented and considered in the context of their implications for potential uses of straw represented by four scenarios. One scenario is the use of straw as a fuel in commercial scale power only, heat only and combined heat and power (CHP) plants. Overall, CHP production provides the most favourable energy and CO2 balances. Results are compared with those for alternative uses or disposal methods for straw, represented by other scenarios, and with those for producing electricity and/or heat by conventional means. Conclusions are drawn concerning the contributions to the energy and carbon balances of using straw as a fuel and recommendations are made for further work.

DE uncertainty; recruit estimation; escapement policy; stock management;
   recruitment; spawner-recruitment relationship; maximum sustainable yield
ID STOCK; CURVE
AB Recruitment observation or estimation always includes uncertainties in some degree. The optimal escapement policy considering the uncertainty in recruitment observation is analyzed, assuming that the spawner-recruitment relationship is well detected. When there is an observation error, the spawner varies from an expected value, by which the recruitment in the next year also varies though the spawner-recruitment relationship is already determined by detailed research. In such cases, the criterion of the constant escapement strategy should be changed. The model predicts that the spawners should be increased with increasing magnitude of estimation error, by which fishery yield can be improved. And it is also suggested that although the yield is increased by strategy considering uncertainty in recruit estimation, it decreases with increasing observation error.

SO FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE net present value; timber; beef; corn; bean
AB The 'front-line' in the war against deforestation is decision-making by individual landowners and other stewards about land-use allocation which, according to economic theory, involves the unbiased comparison of returns from competing options, In this study discounted cash flow analysis is used to estimate the potential returns from three land-use options available to landowners in Costa Pica: sustainable forest management, cattle ranching, and crop production. A growth-and-yield projection model was used to predict the periodic timber yields from a sample of forests in the three most important timber producing regions: the south, north, and Atlantic zones. Information on product yields and costs for the agricultural alternatives was obtained from interviews with farmers. Price data for both timber and agricultural products including historic rates of change were taken from a recent study investigating price trends. The findings suggest that landowners are not basing their land-use decisions on economic grounds alone, and that alternative explanations for their behavior must be sought. Two possible reasons are that landowners may be averse to the periodic nature of the cash flows associated with forest management and/or they may lack basic information on the potential returns and technical requirements for the forestry alternative. Suggestions for government policies needed to promote retention of the remaining natural tropical rainforests are offered.

AB Forest management planning models are highly developed and used extensively, but few explicitly consider the effects of fire and other uncertain losses which can be significant. Previous studies recommended contradictory responses to potential fire loss. We developed forest-level timber management optimization models with deterministic average and stochastic fire loss and used them to develop insight into the impact of uncertainty on forest management planning. Our analysis indicated that producing a stable timber supply requires the establishment of a buffer stock of timber. This strategy reduces the short-term harvest quantity, but increases the expected long-term harvest quantity. Paradoxically, the timber supply is both more stable, and larger. The results are sensitive to the method of regulating timber production: profit maximizing behavior of future producers requires a much greater buffer stock. In addition, bounds on the effect of transportation were developed, conditions where the mean value problem is adequate were identified, and the effect of a downward sloping demand curve was investigated.

ID FUTURE
AB This essay is a response to the dominance of short-term thinking in Western culture. It begins with a critique of the minimal, or fleeting, present and then explores some possibilities for extending what might be meant by the 'present'. It suggests that considerable utility may be derived from a more careful and considered use of particular timeframes. It is doubtful whether questions of sustainability, the rights of future generations and, indeed, the disciplined study of futures can be resolved without a number of innovations based on long-term thinking. The latter part of the essay considers two-the creation of institutions of foresight and an international programme of 21st century studies.

TI Integrating sustainable development and economic restructuring: A role
   for regulation theory?
SO GEOFORUM
LA English
DT Article
AB Despite the growing importance of environmental issues within international and national economic policies, little attention has been paid to these issues in work on economic restructuring. However, the increasing adoption of the concept of sustainable development as a means to resolve conflict between the economy and the environment has major implications for the form and direction of economic restructuring. In this paper it is therefore argued that the growing adoption of sustainable development as a central guiding principle for economic development necessitates the incorporation of environmental issues into work on economic restructuring. The limited amount of existing work linking the environment with economic restructuring is criticized and it is suggested that there is considerable potential to use regulation theory to combine debates on economic restructuring and sustainable development.

TI Rural energy technology: Issues and options for sustainable development

SO GEOFORUM

DT Article
AB Energy availability both by quantity and quality is a key determinant of the economic productivity of most human systems. The real contributions of energy resources in a sustainable development framework, to a greater extent, involve more complex issues, particularly with regard to the nature and degree of technological involvement. In such regions as sub-Saharan Africa where wood provides the bulk of rural energy needs, technological issues range from site level impacts to human health implications. The paper draws on a field study undertaken by the author in Ghana to illustrate the significance of wood energy at the rural level and the various stages and processes in the wood energy sector requiring technological adaptation. Technological constraints in relation to local food systems, traditions, and environmental protection are also analyzed. It is concluded that technological innovations which take into account local environmental and human circumstances will be required in the rural energy sector to meet new challenges.

ID HAIRY VETCH
AB A low-input sustainable agricultural system for the production of staked, fresh-market field tomatoes (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) is described. The system uses winter annual cover crops to fix N, recycle leftover nutrients, produce biomass, and prevent soil erosion throughout the winter and spring. Yields of tomato plants grown in hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth), crimson clover (Trifolium incarnatum L.), and rye (Secale cereale L.) plus hairy vetch mulches were higher than those grown in the conventional black polyethylene (BP) mulch system in 2 of 3 years. Fruit were heavier with the plant mulches than with BP mulch. Eight weeks after transplanting, N levels in tomato leaves were higher with plant than with BP mulch, although the plant mulch plots received only 50% of the N applied to the BP plots. The cover crops had no effect on populations of five phytoparasitic nematode species.

AB This article examines the impact of past extraction methods and present inattention to resource maintenance on the protection and development of the Russian Far East's natural resources. I focus on the forestry sector in particular because of the great importance of forest resources to environmentalists and developers alike. While the Russian Far East contains some of Russia's last remaining old-growth forests, the forestry sector is also of prime interest to developers-in attracting foreign investors, it ranks among the top five sectors in the Russian economy. Foreign investors have been mainly interested in extracting raw materials from the Russian Far East for processing in their home countries. Although this type of cooperation meets the short-term economic needs of the region, debates are taking place in the Russian press about the need to balance pressing needs for investment in resource extraction with the development of high quality processing industries and environmental protection in the Russian Far East.

AB 1. Change in the number of red kangaroos (Macropus rufus) in the South Australian pastoral zone is related to rainfall and population size.
   2. These relationships are used to assess effects of harvesting red kangaroos by predicting the change in the risk of population decline and explosion under a range of harvesting regimes. The predictions account for the combined influences of rainfall, density dependence and environmental stochasticity.
   3. The method illustrates the importance of considering environmental stochasticity when assessing impacts, and how risk assessment may be used to assist wildlife management. Sustainable harvesting rates will be overestimated if environmental stochasticity is ignored.
   4. Because of uncertainty about the response of the red kangaroo population to extremes of rainfall, it is difficult to be certain of the effects of harvesting red kangaroos. The relationship between rainfall and population size depends on the scale of observation. The previous year's rainfall is most closely related to changes in population size over the whole pastoral zone. Over smaller areas, summer and autumn is the most critical rainfall period.

TI Estimating the minimum population size that allows a given annual number

SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY

   Leslie matrix model
ID CERVUS-ELAPHUS; DYNAMICS
AB 1. The management of ungulate populations for sport in the presence of potentially conflicting interests such as conservation, either of the animals or of the habitat they use, may be formulated as a problem of optimization subject to constraints.
   2. A deterministic simulation model was developed to assess optimal culling strategies for Scottish red deer. The aim was to allow deer population size to be reduced while maintaining a given annual cull of mature males (stags).
   3. To achieve the above aim, the model indicated that the female (hind) cull should be restricted to non-lactating adult (yeld) and immature hinds.
   4. If, instead, only calf and hind pairs are culled, the population size must be roughly 14% larger to achieve the same cull of mature stags.
   5. Under ideal conditions, it seems possible to reduce hind numbers so that there are just two hinds of age greater than or equal to 1 for every stag of age greater than or equal to 6 in the population, provided that the population is maintained well below the maximum sustainable size (carrying capacity). Under this strategy, the model indicated that the ratio of stags of age greater than or equal to 1 to hinds of age greater than or equal to 1 should be between 1.5 and 1.8 to 1.0.
   6. In principle, for populations well below carrying capacity, for every 10 mature stags to be stalked annually, it seems possible to reduce numbers such that the summer population comprises just 70 stags, 40 hinds and 20 calves.
   7. In practice, limited culling of hind and calf pairs and young stags for quality control or other reasons, together with the need for a margin of safety, dictates that the hind population should be rather larger than this. However, on most estates in Scotland, hinds currently outnumber stags by roughly 2:1, so that our results suggest that large decreases in numbers of hinds can be achieved without incurring a loss of revenue from stalking.
   8. If the market expectation were to be changed so that hunters wished to stalk stags regardless of age, rather than just those with perceived 'trophy' value as mature animals, the same number of deer could be stalked at an even lower population density, to the benefit of other land uses.

SO JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES

DT Article
ID REPRESSION; LIBERALIZATION; INVESTMENT; MARKETS; HELLO
AB It is a central argument of the financial repression literature that interest rates should be determined by the market to reflect the true cost of capital. This article suggests that the notion of an 'equilibrium interest rate' may be undefined since the rate required to balance financial markets differs from that required to equilibrate savings and investment. Thus liberalisation introduces an intrinsic instability into the financial system as a result of portfolio adjustment. The article examines the Chilean and Korean experiences and concludes that a sustainable reform requires positive but low real interest rates and broad regulation of the financial system to ensure macroeconomic stability.

TI Solid-waste management system analysis with noise control and traffic
   congestion limitations
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING-ASCE
LA English
DT Article
ID CAPACITY
AB Conventional location/allocation models for solid-waste management usually focus on economic optimization with respect to mass balance, capacity limitation, operating, and financial constraints. But the siting of important facilities, such as landfills, incinerators, and transfer stations, in a solid-waste management system still involves several explicit limitations that must be considered through the use of optimization techniques. This paper presents a sustainable waste management strategy in which the decision makers and the environmental analysts may put forward their views on the assimilative capacity of two major environmental factors: noise control and traffic congestion. A mixed integer programming model with the framework of dynamic optimization still can be used efficiently to achieve this goal. The practical implementation is assessed by the case study of the Kaohsiung solid-waste management system in Taiwan. It shows that the incorporation of these two environmental factors does alter the conventional waste-flow pattern in metropolitan solid-waste management systems.

AB Victorian landcare groups are increasingly seen as the key element of an emerging Australian success story. The assumptions underlying landcare are that limited funding of group activity will produce more aware, informed, skilled and adaptive resource managers with a stronger stewardship ethic, will increase the adoption of sustainable practices, and will assist the move to more sustainable resource use. A survey of all landholders in 12 subcatchments of north-east Victoria was undertaken in 1993 to assess the impact of landcare participation upon key programme outcomes. Information from the northeast survey indicated that landcare participation had a significant impact upon landholder awareness of issues, level of knowledge and adoption of best bet practices. This information, and earlier research by the authors, suggests that landcare group activity has made an important contribution towards sustainable resource management. However, research findings also suggested a number of flaws in programme logic. Given the low levels of profitability amongst landholders, the vast scale and intractable nature of key issues and the considerable off-site benefits of remedial action, it is problematic whether limited funding of a community development process will effect behavioural changes that are sufficient to make a difference at the landscape level. Programme emphasis upon developing landholders' stewardship ethic also appears misplaced in that there was no significant difference in the stewardship ethic of participants and non-participants. Indeed, to the extent that landcare focuses upon changing individual behaviour rather than societal barriers to rural development, landcare is open to the criticism that it places too much responsibility upon individual landholders.

AB The western diamondback rattlesnake Crotalus atrox can rattle its tail continuously for hours at frequencies approaching 90 Hz. We examined the basis of these fast sustainable contractions using electromyography, data on oxygen uptake and the quantitative ultrastructure of the tailshaker muscle complex, The tailshaker muscle has no unique structures; rather, the relative of the structures common to all skeletal muscles appear to be present (1) to minimize activation, contraction and relaxation times via an extremely high volume density of sarcoplasmic reticulum (26%) as well as, (2) to maximize ATP resysnthesis via a high volume density of mitochondria (26%), The high rate of ATP supply is reflected in the in vivo muscle mass-specific oxygen uptake of this group of muscles which, at 585 ml O-2 kg(-1) min(-1) during rattling at 30 degrees C body temperature, exceeds that reported for other ectotherm and many endotherm muscles, Since the change in oxygen uptake paralleled that of the rattling frequency over the range of measured body temperatures, there was a nearly constant Oz cost per muscle contraction (0.139+/-0.016 mu l O-2 g(-1)). Electromyographic analysis suggests that each of the six muscles that make up the shaker complex mag be a single motor unit, Finally, the maximum rate of mitochondrial oxygen uptake is similar to that of various mammals, a hummingbird, a lizard, an anuran amphibian and of isolated mitochondria (at 10000-40000 molecules O-2 s(-1) mu m(2) of cristae surface area, when normalized to 30 degrees C), suggesting a shared principle of design of the inner mitochondrial membrane among the vertebrates.

AB The benefits accruing from good environmental management of companies are most often linked to economic benefit and the concept of moving towards sustainable development. However, the link between environmental liabilities, assets, or performance, and the financial valuation of a company remains obscure at best. Operational improvements, for example from implementing a waste minimization programme, can give a clear short-term reduction in costs, and impact immediately on profits. Many environmental risk management programmes also need to deal with long-term issues such as historical land contamination and changes in manufacturing technology. These have a much more protracted and ultimately fundamental impact on the perceived capital value and future prospects of a company. This paper seeks to describe how the relationship between environmental and financial risk management is becoming clearer, and uses examples to show how this is brought into focus during merger and acquisition activities.

TI Integrating environment policy with business strategy
SO LONG RANGE PLANNING

DT Article
AB Many businesses have had environmental policies for several years but few have integrated these policies with their business strategy. Examples are used to show how this integration has been successfully accomplished by different companies with benefits far the company, the environment, and the community. The ways in which integration is achieved varies considerably. The firm's financial situation, its unique circumstances, its impact on the natural environment, and the degree of top level commitment all contribute to the merging of business strategy and environment policy. Studies from other sources provide powerful indicators of lasting business success. These include research on visionary and adaptable companies. This article offers ideas which bring together the strategic environmental challenge and the ingredients for sustainable success in our changing world. These ideas can be used by managers to assess their own organizations and establish an appropriate way forward. There is increasing evidence that fundamental change is necessary which will mean transforming businesses and establishing new ways of thinking. A self-assessment scale enables managers to establish what this may mean for their organization.

It has been suggested that firms can achieve a competitive advantage rough global relocation. However not all such moves provide a sustainable competitive advantage. In this study we examine the global relocation activities of a sample of Dutch firms. Based on the experiences of these firms we develop a six step process that should help firms avoid global relocation obstacles and obtain a sustainable competitive advantage.

DT Article
AB The Black Forest is a typical low-range mountain region (Mittelgebirge) in Central Europe. It serves as an example for discussion focusing on the relationship of historical evaluation of natural resources, development of settlement patterns, and sustainable economic processes in mountains. The theoretical framework is described in terms of sustainable development, accessibility, and vulnerability. Examples of resource use during different historical stages are chosen to illustrate the development of the present-day cultural landscape and to indicate the multiple adaptations of the region to external challenges. The choice of representative locations relates to the itinerary of an excursion led by the author in conjunction with the IGU symposium ''Mountain Geoecology and Sustainable Development'' in August 1994.

AB A three season study was conducted to determine the effect of added composted yard waste, arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, and fertilizer on plant cover, standing crop biomass, species composition, AM fungal infectivity and spore density in coarse taconite iron ore tailing plots seeded with a mixture of native prairie grasses. Plant cover and biomass, percent seeded species, mycorrhizal infectivity and spore density were greatly increased by additions of composted yard waste. After three seasons, total plant cover was also greater in plots with added fertilizer. Third season plant cover was also greater in plots amended with the higher rate (44.8 Mg ha(-1)) of compost than the moderate rate (22.4 Mg ha(-1)). Field inoculation with AM fungi also increased plant cover during the second season and infectivity during the first two seasons. Seeded native species, consisting mostly of the cover species Elymus canadensis, dominated plot vegetation during the second and third seasons. Dispersal of AM fungal propagules into nonmycorrhizal plots occurred rapidly and increased infectivity in compost-amended plots during the third season. In plots with less than 10% plant cover, AM fungal infectivity of inoculated plots was greatly reduced after the second season. The high level of plant cover and the trend of increasing proportion of mycorrhizal-dependent warm-season grasses, along with increases in infectivity, forecast the establishment of a sustainable native grass community that will meet reclamation goals.

AB Soil acidification is a major factor limiting the sustainability of agricultural production systems throughout the world. Liming may not always be economically possible and therefore alternative methods or complementary methods of amelioration are required. Leaf litter collected from several tree species was examined for ash alkalinity (as an estimate of organic anion content) and ability to ameliorate an acid soil. Ash alkalinity measured by titration of the ash and excess cation values obtained by calculation as the difference between cation and anion content were correlated. Values obtained by the latter method ranged from 247 cmol(c) kg(-1) for Melia azedarach (white cedar) to 36 cmol(c) kg(-1) for Eucalyptus globoidea (white stringybark). There was a significant linear correlation between ash alkalinity and the Ca concentration in the litter. When added to an acid soil (pH 4.04 measured in 0.01 M calcium chloride) and incubated for 8 weeks, leaf litter raised the pH. Species differed markedly with Melia azedarach having the greatest effect. The increase in pH was proportional to the quantity of ash alkalinity (organic anions) added, expressed as calcium carbonate equivalents. Aluminium levels on the exchange complex were lowered by treatment with leaf litter through direct precipitation of a solid phase and again Melia azedarach litter was most effective. There was also indirect evidence of organo-Al complexes affecting the concentration of monomeric Al in soil treated with litter from Liquidambar styraciflua (liquidambar), Quercus robur (English oak) and Pinus radiata (radiata pine).

AB In policy theory, technology assessment is most effective when applied in the early stages of research and development, when changes are easier. This ability depends on the qualities of the given tools. Visions and metaphors enjoy much attention today because they provide an early but sustainable orientation. Understanding their necessarily ambivalent nature, their social function, and their cognitive significance provides the basis for their use in analysis. Working with visions more systematically than we do today can improve the selection of technological alternatives. While the method of assessing future technologies with metaphors will not (and cannot, just like all other technology assessments) forecast subsequent decisions, it provides insights about tomorrow's technologies that can inform today's decisions.

AB In the first part of this lecture it is demonstrated, how knowledge that comes from studies of catalysis at the molecular level helps to design new, more efficient catalysts and catalytic processes. In the second part the importance of catalytic technologies for solving environmental issues and providing sustainable development is discussed. It is demonstrated how catalysis helps to protect the ozone layer, to combat the greenhouse effect, to create environmentally safer transport, to solve environmental problems of energy production, to prevent pollution by H2S in gas and oil mining and by CH4 in coal mining, to purify exhausts of chemical and various other industries, to provide the highest energy efficiency and minimize consumption of raw materials in the chemical, petroleum and other industries, to process renewable raw materials, such as biomass, into valuable chemicals. In the third part, the role of the natural abiotic catalysis in the chemistry of the troposphere is discussed.

SO RISK ANALYSIS

DE benefit; Bayesian; hurricane; disaster; construction
AB A Bayesian compound Poisson benefit-risk model is described in this paper, and used to evaluate recent revisions to the South Florida Building Code (SFBC). The model accounts for natural variability in hurricane frequency and severity, and uncertainty in the effectiveness of the revised code. Ranges of residential growth rate, code effectiveness, construction cost increase, and planning period length are assumed, to show the ranges of cost-to-performance ratio within which the code will make sense economically. The expected cost of residential hurricane damage over 50 years for ten South Florida counties assuming continuation of previous building practices was $93 billion, equivalent to the residential damage of 5.2 Andrews. Assuming a reduction in the growth of damageable housing in South Florida from 5.5% to 2% as a result of code revision, estimated damages under the new code were $45 billion At a per-house construction cost increase of 5%, the probability of at least recovering the estimated $40 billion cost of the specified wind-resistant construction was estimated to be 47%. Expected return on investment was estimated at $7 billion over 50 years. The expected return lies between a $44 billion loss and a $47 billion gain, when growth in damageable housing is allowed to range from 1% to 4% and construction cost increases are assumed to lie between 3% and 8%. Actual monetary return for a 5% cost increase and 2% growth in damageable housing ranges from a $20 billion loss to a $100 billion gain with 95% probability, as a result of weather variability alone. Results support SFBC revisions on solely economic grounds, a conclusion strengthened considerably in light of potentially avoided deaths and hurricane traumas. The model represents one approach to evaluating economic aspects of the sustainability of new technological measures on the basis of available information.

AB Thermal techniques, namely, thermogravimetry (TG), simultaneous thermogravimetry-differential thermal analysis-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (TG-DTA-FTIR) and thermomagnetometry, were used to examine the thermal behaviour of heavy-mineral tailings generated in oil-sand steam processing operations. The results will be used in the selection and optimization of a thermal process to remove residual bitumen in the tailings and recover the contained titanium and zirconium values. The recovery of heavy minerals from the tailings would contribute significantly to the environmental sustainability as well as to the commercial viability of the operations. The results of the study indicated that the residual bitumen can be removed by heating the material in an oxidizing atmosphere at about 600 degrees C. The product may then be heated to a higher temperature in a reducing atmosphere to decompose the complex titanium/iron minerals and later recover titanium values by separating the iron or iron oxide magnetically.

ID ORGANIZATIONAL PERFORMANCE; EMPLOYEE OWNERSHIP; JOB ATTITUDES
AB We present in this paper a number of propositions regarding the implementation of total quality management (TQM). These propositions are derived from a study of Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award winners. The propositions are structured into four groups dealing with cultural change, focus, employee ownership of the processes, and strategic partnering with customers and suppliers. Each of these issues is critical to the implementation or sustainability of TQM in organizations. It is not our intention from the discussion of these propositions to present answers, bur instead to generate meaningful and interesting research questions on the implementation of TQM.

SO TROPICAL MEDICINE & INTERNATIONAL HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
DE nutrition/health education; sustainability; night blindness; Bangladesh
ID XEROPHTHALMIA; RISK
AB Cross-sectional surveys were conducted to assess prevalence of night-blindness and dietary habits prior to intervention (in 1986), after 3 years of intervention (in 1989) and 3 years after the termination of active intervention (in 1992), in the northern part of Bangladesh. The prevalence of night-blindness per thousand children decreased from 1986 to 1989 (during intervention) and rose from 1989 to 1992, but remained significantly lower in 1992 than the 1986 prevalence. Household income declined from 1989 to 1992, and lower consumption of beta-carotene rich food, protein items and vitamin A capsules was registered in 1992 despite almost the same level of awareness relating to the prevention of night-blindness in the community during the period 1989-1992. The results indicate that the long-term impact of a health education programme to prevent night-blindness is uncertain. Improvement in socioeconomic conditions, in addition to relevant knowledge, is probably a precondition for maintaining a sustainable impact of health education.

TI Argentina: Growth resumption, sustainability, and environment
SO WORLD DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper analyzes the sustainability of the current growth process in Argentina, taking into account macroeconomic consistency and environmental constraints. The economy appears to be generating an unsustainable current account deficit and a relative price distortion in favor of nontradables, impeding a needed increase in exports. Resolution of the main environmental problems would absorb around 10% of savings over the next 10 years. The saving scarcity suggests that a gradualist policy giving priority to the urban environment should be implemented.

ID 1980S
AB This paper considers prospects for improving growth and income distribution in India that are broadly sustainable in terms of macroeconomic and environmental constraints. It first describes recent economic trends and the reform process, using a simple framework which can incorporate political economy issues. It then takes up environmental questions and the interaction of the environment and the macroeconomy. Based on this analysis, the economy's medium-term prospects are discussed under current policy and an alternative approach which is arguably more promising for growth, distribution, and the environment.

DT Article
AB This paper reviews the economic reform process in Mexico since the mid-1980s and its association with disappointing growth. The sluggishness is linked to a deterioration of the current account vs. growth tradeoff and unsatisfactory productivity growth and capital formation. Real currency appreciation and declining savings figured in these developments. Social and environmental sustainability will require faster growth in the future. Appropriate policy changes could move the economy toward a higher growth path while addressing its major environmental problems.

AB Calculation of the most useful gas chromatographic retention parameters, such as net and specific retention volumes, relative retentions, and retention indices, requires that raw retention data be corrected for gas hold-up time or volume (sometimes called dead time or volume) of the chromatographic system. When a flame-ionization detector is used, a common technique (where it is physically appropriate) is to introduce methane into the sample as a marker to approximate unretained species to correct for hold-up. This is often done by bubbling methane (or natural gas) through the sample just before injection. In this paper, we describe two easily constructed devices that provide continuous release of methane into liquid samples, sustainable for several weeks or even months. This long-term feature makes the techniques especially suitable to extensive retention studies done at multiple temperatures on several stationary phases. Moreover, one of the devices described is applicable to commercially available automatic sampler vials. After a detailed description of the construction of the devices is provided, some applications are discussed.

AB In their diversity, living organisms and communities evolve in connection with their environment, which hey contribute in return to shape and regularize. Like the other species, indeed more than them, manking makes use of biodiversity to survive. Traditional agriculture emphasizes this effort: it has globally increased both agricultural species diversity and agricultural production, while managing environment. The fragility of this balance has become obvious in the 20th century, as a result of mankind's scientific, technical, economic and demographic expansion. Biodiversity must be watched over and protected, as a now endangered natural resource: to secure long-term food safety and quality, sustainable land rise End management, and lastly environment quality. One must point out the responsibility of several groups : consumers, to maintain the diversity of agricultural species; citizens, to direct economic development so as to protect the diversity of wild organisms; research people, to build up a culture of biodiversity, basis of a good policy in this essential field where farmers play a prominent part.

AB Of 20 groups of Cape mountain zebras re-introduced into new conservation areas 12 have increased, 6 have remained stable or decreased, and 2 went extinct. One of the main reasons for the poor performance of some of the groups was that insufficient numbers were re-introduced. In those cases where the population increased the mean number originally introduced was 15.1. This is significantly higher (P < 0.05) than the number introduced in the cases that failed to increase (8.1). This is in accord with other studies that have shown that the success of re-introductions is closely linked to the numbers of animals re-introduced. The mean percentage annual increase of the populations over the first three to five years after re-introduction (0.4%) was significantly (P < 0.05) lower than that over the subsequent 3 to 5 years (9.3%). This probably reflects the effects of capture stress, break up of family groups and adaptation to a-new environment. There was no significant relationship between maternal age and progeny sex ratio in Cape mountain zebra. A simulation modelling package, VORTEX was used as an aid to the management of Cape mountain zebra. Rates of population growth and sustainable harvests derived by means of the model were similar to those observed in the real population. The model is useful in analysing the poor performance of small populations re-introduced into new conservation areas, which may help to avoid unrealistic expectations on the part of new owners of mountain zebra herds and to underline the necessity of starting with a reasonable number of animals.

AB This paper develops a theoretical. framework that explains market inefficiency and firm heterogeneity as a function of firm and market embeddedness in an institutional context. The paper introduces the concept of institutional impediments to market efficiency to explain the influence of embeddedness on sustainable firm differences. These institutional impediments are proposed to affect three key sources of sustainable competitive advantage: transaction costs, social capital, and cognitive sunk costs. An institutional perspective on firm heterogeneity suggests that opportunities for above-normal returns are not only a function of firm and market characteristics but also depend more fundamentally on the normative and social context of firm and market conduct.

AB This article examines the proposition that levels of agro-diversity decline with increasing intensification of agricultural systems. Much of the literature on swidden farming highlights the great numbers of both cultivated and wild species of plants these systems incorporate, while descriptions of mechanised intensive agriculture point to the small number of species managed. The article reports on an agroeco-system that is known for its intensity-that of the Kofyar of central Nigeria-yet which maintains high levels of diversity. The article explores more generally, the role of biodiversity in systems of smallholder agriculture and makes the case that these systems, like that of the Kofyar, foster biodiversity as part of environmental and economic sustainability even as they adapt to new agricultural conditions.

AB Changes in landscape over a period of 50 years were analysed in a rural area of 324 ha in Central Finland. The data were digitized from aerial photographs of the National Land Survey taken in 1944, 1959, 1979 and 1991, and analysed with the IDRISI (TM) geographic information system (GIS). The average proportion of land in agricultural use in the sample area was 17.4%.
   The arable area declined from the maximum of 62.3 ha (1959) to 47.6 ha. The total length of linear landscape elements, predominantly ditch bank habitats, halved, from 876 m/ha of field (1944) to 449 m/ha by the end of the period. The average rate of loss of field boundary habitat was 9.1 m/ha/ year. At the same time, the Shannon-Weaver index of diversity of agricultural landscape elements dropped from 0.37 to 0.24. The number of field parcels declined by 29%, and the mean parcel size increased by 45%, from 1.2 ha to 1.7 ha. The index value of the fractal dimension measuring the complexity of parcel shapes also fell, from 1.88 (1959) to 1.86 (1991).
   The change in spatial structure reflects the intensification of farming in Finland. Biodiversity at ecosystem level has clearly declined. However, the implications for the agroecosystem and its sustainability are still unknown.

TI Comparing productivity of millet-based cropping systems in unstable
   environments of the Sahel: Possibilities and challenges
SO AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS

DT Article
AB Falling per capita food production, increasing population pressure on arable land and soil nutrient mining that occurs under traditional cropping systems in West Africa have generated a strong demand for more productive yet sustainable cropping systems. Total factor productivity methodology was used to analyze millet-based cropping systems developed for the Sahel. Interspatial total factor productivity comparisons indicate that the new cropping systems were more profitable than the traditional cropping system. However, the determination of the sustainability of the tested systems was constrained by lack of appropriate time series data to cope with environmental instability in the Sahel and changes in resource stocks. In designing new cropping system technologies for areas prone to degradation, a multidisciplinary research strategy, is needed to identify and measure resource stock changes that affect productivity. It is also imperative to use crops and systems models, particularly in unstable climatic environments, to generate adequate time series data for the measurement of sustainability. Finally, cropping systems evaluated should include both packages and components. This will permit rite formulation of recommendations that fit resources or preferences of different farmers.

AB Sustainability is a term which is increasingly being used by researchers, politicians and informed members of the public. However, criteria for carrying out research within a sustainable systems framework are either ill-defined or non-existent. As an aid to this process the concept of sustainable pathways and viability space are introduced and interpreted as the need to maintain adaptive capacity, and therefore options within production systems that interact with the natural environment.
   A research approach is required which takes account of ecological, economic and social aspects of change and that is able to interpret and synthesise information, generated from a range of sources, in a manner which is policy relevant. This requires the construction of interfaces which link activities across a range of disciplines. A research project designed to assess the potential of alternative cropping systems is used to illustrate a series of interfaces. It is argued that demonstrating and developing the connections between the concept of sustainability and decision making processes provides an immediate challenge to those undertaking methodological research.

AB This paper examines conceptual and methodological barriers to using sustainability as a criterion for guiding change in agriculture and proposes elements necessary for approaches to characterizing sustainability to be generally useful. Two broad interpretations of agricultural sustainability have emerged with different underlying goals: sustainability interpreted as an approach to agriculture developed in response to concerns about impacts of agriculture, with motivating adherence to sustainable ideologies and practices as its goal; and sustainability interpreted as a property of agriculture developed in response to concerns about threats to agriculture, with the goal of using it as a criterion for guiding agriculture as it responds to change. Interpreting sustainability as an approach has been useful for motivating change. However, usefulness of this interpretation as a criterion for guiding change is hindered by a lack of generality of prescribed approaches, a distorted view of conventional agriculture and circular logic. Although interpreting sustainability as a system property is logically more consistent, conceptual and practical problems with its characterization have limited its usefulness as a criterion for guiding change. In order for sustainability to be a useful criterion for guiding change in agriculture, its characterization should be literal, system-oriented,quantitative, predictive, stochastic and diagnostic.

TI Analytical framework for disentangling the concept of sustainable land
   use
SO AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
AB Definitions of sustainability have till now failed to suit both conceptual and operational purposes for lack of an appropriate analytical framework that can be used by biophysical and socio-economic sciences with equal ease. A framework for analysing sustainable land use is proposed which distinguishes between agro-ecological and socio-economic components and between different hierarchical system levels. In some detail the agroecological component is discussed in terms of changes in the stock of natural resources. Two decision-making levels with regard to land use, the farm level and the policy level are discussed in terms of the trade-offs between agro-ecological sustainability and socio-economic objectives.

TI Sustainability of bean production systems on steep lands in Costa Rica
SO AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
ID ECOSYSTEMS; STABILITY
AB Responding to changes in rural-urban linkages and government policies, bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) production systems in Costa Rica are undergoing transitions. Impacts of changes in bean production systems on environmental and economic sustainability were analysed at the field, farm and policy levels. A combination of interviews, agronomic surveys, on-farm experiments, and secondary information was used. Changes in agronomic and economic conditions over time were assessed by conducting agronomic surveys and experiments on farms representing a range of land-use intensities. Trade-offs between productivity and stability were quantified using Modified Stability Analysis. The adoption of land and agrochemical-intensive methods by resource-poor farmers cultivating steep lands resulted in decreased environmental and economic sustainability. Farmers with adequate resources were able to maintain economic viability by transferring land out of beans and into other commodities, particularly cattle. However, this shift in resource use decreased social equity by decreasing farm labour opportunities for smallholders and landless farmers and diminishing land available for tenants. These studies indicate that the impact of technology introduction on farming system sustainability can be assessed effectively by conducting integrated socioeconomic and agronomic analyses across farms representing various land-use practices and intensities.

ID CYLINDRICA L RAEUSCHEL
AB Purely annual crop-based production systems have limited scope to be sustainable under upland conditions prone to infestation by Imperata cylindrica if animal or mechanical tillage is not available. Farmers who must rely on manual cultivation of grassland soils can achieve some success in suppressing Imperata for a number of years using intensive relay and intercropping systems that maintain a dense soil cover throughout the year, especially where leguminous cover crops are included in the crop cycle. However, labour investment increases and returns to labour tend to decrease in successive years as weed pressure intensifies and soil quality declines.
   Continuous crop production has been sustained in many Imperata-infested areas where farmers have access to animal or tractor draft power. Imperata control is not a major problem in such situations. Draft power drastically reduces the labour requirements in weed control. Sustained crop production is then dependent more solely upon soil fertility management. Mixed farming systems that include cattle may also benefit from manure application to the cropped area, and the use of non-cropped fallow areas for grazing. In extensive systems where Imperata infestation is tolerated, cassava or sugarcane are often the crops with the longest period of viable production as the land degrades.
   On sloping Imperata lands, conservation farming practices are necessary to sustain annual cropping. Pruned tree hedgerows have often been recommended for these situations. On soils that are not strongly acidic they may consistently improve yields. But labour is the scarcest resource on small farms and tree-pruning is usually too labour-intensive to be practical. Buffer strip systems that provide excellent soil conservation but minimize labour have proven much more popular with farmers. Prominent among these are natural vegetative strips, or strips of introduced fodder grasses.
   The value of Imperata to restore soil fertility is low, particularly compared with woody secondary growth or Compositae species such as Chromolaena odorata or Tithonia diversifolia. Therefore, fallow-rotation systems where farmers can intervene to shift the fallow vegetation toward such naturally-occurring species, or can manage introduced cover crop species such as Mucuna utilis cv. cochinchinensis, enable substantial gains in yields and sustainability. Tree fallows are used successfully to achieve sustained cropping by some upland communities. A variation of this is rotational hedgerow intercropping, where a period of cropping is followed by one or more years of tree growth to generate nutrient-rich biomass, rehabilitate the soil, and suppress Imperata. These options, which suit farmers in quite resource-poor situations, should receive more attention.

AB Basic prerequisites for sustainable reforestation of Imperata grasslands in Southeast Asia are presented. A theoretical forest is designed according to these prerequisites. Composed of basic units managed by local smallholders, the forest is composed of two sets of commercial tree species suited to local conditions, one set providing regular cash income and the other providing seasonal or irregular cash income. Such composition ensures economic and ecological viability of the forest in the long run, provided that clear tenurial rights on the basic units are recognized. Guidelines for a transition from Imperata grasslands to forest are presented, underlining the importance of relying on natural succession processes. The theoretical forest is identified as an agroforest, a diverse forest rebuilt and managed by farmers, providing forest and agricultural products for both cash income and household consumption. Agroforests have been developed for decades by indigenous farmers in some regions of Southeast Asia. Examples from Indonesia are presented to support the theoretical analysis. They show that the agroforest alternative is a valuable unifying concept for reforestation of Imperata grasslands, for a sustainable upland agriculture, and more generally for an equitable environmentally and economically sound development of rural areas in the humid tropics.

AB With or without human intervention, animals are important components of grassland and forest ecosystems. When settlers occupy and cultivate land, they invariably bring animals with them. Livestock integrated in the production system convert crop residues and weeds into valuable products while most plant nutrients are retained. As animal feed, Imperata has low nutritional value, especially with advancing maturity. Supplemental feeding of ruminants with urea-molasses-mineral blocks or introduction of fodder species, especially legumes, have significantly improved production under smallholder farm systems. Fodder species for fallow improvement, modified alley cropping or hedgerow systems, and plantations integrating livestock production, all hold promise for future use of Imperata grasslands. Diversified systems may help settlers reach self-sufficiency while increasing the sustainability of the system. Research and development interventions towards improved livestock productivity in smallholder farms may have low economic but high social benefit, These benefits are especially attainable if the farm families participate in the design and implementation of innovations. Security of land tenure, provision of credit, and mechanisms marketing of produce are issues that need to be addressed in more innovative ways.

AB This review is prefaced by an introduction to biological characteristics of Imperata cylindrica which relate to its control by chemical and mechanical methods. Of the many herbicides tested and used against I. cylindrica, glyphosate has became the market leader but the potential of imazapyr is also recognized. The activity of additives to improve glyphosate and imazapyr performance is summarised and linked to a review of spray volume rates and the use of three types of application equipment: hydraulic (knapsack) sprayers, spinning discs and weed wipers. An example of the practical use of glyphosate in an estate crop is given. The role of tillage in the management of I. cylindrica is discussed but emphasis is given to pressing as a technique for promoting natural regeneration of forestry species. An integrated approach is considered to be essential for the management of I. cylindrica whereby fire prevention and methods of control are deployed in the conversion of Imperata-dominated land into sustainable, productive systems. Examples are given of integrated management in commodity plantations, rehabilitation of Imperata grasslands through reforestation, and conservation tillage to sustain soil fertility and productivity.

   maize, cassava and tree productivity

DE Cajanus cajan; intercropping; Leucaena leucocephala; mineral fertiliser;

AB In southern Benin, West Africa, two alley cropping systems were studied from 1986 to 1992. Yield development was followed in a maize and cassava crop rotation vs. intercropping system, with alleys of Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit and Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp. vs. a no-tree control, with and without NPK fertiliser. Without alleys, NPK fertilisation maintained high yield levels of 2-3 t maize dry grain plus 4-6 t ha(-1) cassava root DM in intercropping, 3-4 t ha(-1) maize and 6-10 t ha(-1) cassava in solecropping. Without NPK, final yields seemed to stabilise at about 1 t maize plus 2 t cassava in intercropping and twice as much in each solecrop. Alley cropping induced significant yield increases by about 50% with both tree species in unfertilised, intercropped maize, and with Cajanus in fertilised, solecropped cassava. In monetary terms, the NPK-fertiliser response of stabilised yields was significant for all treatments except the solecropped Leucaena alleys. It is concluded that on Ultisols with low nutrient status in the upper rooting zone, alley cropping with low-competitive tree species may improve food crop yields but the greatest monetary output is achieved by intercropping with mineral fertiliser independent of the presence or absence of an agroforestry component.

   structure of rubber gardens in West Kalimantan, Indonesia

DE rubber (Hevea brasiliensis); diversity; conservation; rural development
ID AGROFORESTRY SYSTEM; SUMATRA; FORESTS
AB The goal of this study was to assess the potential of small-holder rubber cultivation in agroforestry gardens to fulfill simultaneously the goals of conservation and sustainable rural development. I examined the structure and species composition of trees in 11 rubber gardens in West Kalimantan, Indonesia, using a single 0.10 ha plot per garden. Although 41 distinct morphotypes were encountered, rubber (Hevea brasiliensis) dominated the sample of 370 trees. Richness within plots varied (3-15 morphotypes), as did the predominance of rubber (24-97% of all basal area, 24-91% of all individuals). The importance of rubber within a garden was significantly negatively correlated with the number of morphotypes present. This result suggests that tree diversity may limit potential productivity of rubber gardens. Thus, small-holders may not be willing to maintain diversity at the scale of a single garden. Although species-accumulation curves indicate that substantial tree diversity may exist across all rubber holdings, diversity is likely to be lost from the system if individual owners reduce species richness in their gardens. Rubber agroforestry as currently practiced in West Kalimantan is not an ideal model for matching rural development needs with the achievement of conservation goals. Other models, such as tengkawang- and durian-based fruit gardens, do exist in Kalimantan and elsewhere, and should be evaluated for incorporation into policy and development strategies.

AB This study of the pruning of nere (Parking biglobosa) trees in central Burkina Faso included detailed surveys of 83 trees and their owners in 21 villages. Pruning is not widespread, but appears to be a practice with various motives and techniques. The motives are mainly aimed at deliberate management of the trees, in order to enhance their fruit production, and are rarely aimed at reducing tree impact on crop productivity. The characteristics of tree pruning techniques (e.g., frequency, intensity and seasonality) and their corresponding motives appear to change as an adaptation to land degradation processes and the deterioration of tree condition. The results demonstrate that indigenous silvicultural management techniques contribute to a sustainable use of tree resources.

TI A review on the potential of improved fallows and green manure in Rwanda

   farming; planted fallow
AB Agricultural production in the densely populated highlands of Rwanda is subject to serious soil fertility constraints. As the use of imported mineral fertilizers is beyond the economic means of resource-poor farmers, research and extension efforts of several projects, institutes and organizations concentrated during the last 15 years on the development and promotion of improved fallows with woody and herbaceous legumes, like Tephrosia sp., Cajanus sp., Crotalaria sp., Sesbania sp., Mucuna sp. and Mimosa sp., planted over one or more seasons as pure green manure, in hedgerows (alley cropping), or on fields as seasonal inter- or relay-crop. Green manuring proved to be a risky enterprise, due to highly variable biomass production and residual effects. Yield increments on-farm of up to 74% in the first season and 46% in the second season did not compensate loss of yields and labour investments during green manuring. Even where biomass production was sufficient, residual effects were in most cases unsatisfactory, due to rapid nutrient leaching (N, K) or inappropriate foliage incorporation on-farm. In researcher-managed trials, residual effects were in general somewhat higher, but more than a mere compensation of lost yields was not possible and farmers' adoption of these labour-intensive technologies was rather low. Due to acute land shortage, farmers were reluctant in allocating land to fallows or hedgerows also, with the exception of fields already out of production. Consequently, the concept of improving soil fertility and crop yields with the help of planted fallows or green manure in rotation failed. Woody legumes might have a future on abandoned fields and in wide spaced contour hedges, mainly for the production of firewood and bean stakes. For soil fertility management, the production and availability of farmyard manure and country-own mineral fertilizers, such as travertin and volcanic ashes should be supported. The question is raised as to whether sustainable agricultural development is possible without a credit system for small farmers, reallocating land and creating off-farm employment.

   GROWTH
AB Fast growing trees, in particular nitrogen fixing trees,are essential for the establishment of sustainable agroforestry practices by resource-poor and/or environmentally conscious farmers. An important selection factor for trees is therefore high N-2 fixing capability. This study was conducted to examine biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) in Leucaena leucocephala L., as affected by growth in pots containing 4, 10, 15 and 30 kg soil and when grown together with Eucalyptus camaldulensis. BNF was measured by the N-15 isotope dilution technique. Leucaena and Eucalyptus were grown either sole (SL, SE) or in two mixtures (1:1 - L1:EI and 1:2 - L1:E2) for a period of 6 months. Planting pattern influenced (P < 0.05) dry matter and N content of shoot and roots of Eucalyptus, as the sole planted trees gave the highest yield. Dry matter, N content and total amount of N fixed by Leucaena significantly decreased with decreasing rooting volume. Also, the smaller the rooting volume (or soil weight), the higher was the proportion (%) of N derived from the atmosphere (%Ndfa) by leucaena. For each rooting volume, the sole or mixed planting pattern did not significantly influence either the proportion (%) or amount of N fixed by leucaena. For these trees, therefore, rooting volume rather than cropping pattern influenced the proportion and amount of nitrogen fixed.

ID WOMEN
AB Trachoma, an ocular infection caused by Chlamydia trachomatis, is the second leading cause of blindness worldwide. The blinding sequelae, which occur in middle age, are felt to be the result of numerous or lengthy episodes of severe inflammatory trachoma in childhood. Risk factors for constant, severe trachoma were identified in a group of children enrolled in a longitudinal study in Kongwa, Tanzania, where villages were randomized in a clinical trial of mass treatment and a behavior modification campaign. In 1989, each of 1,417 randomly selected children had photographs taken of an upper eyelid for determination of their trachoma status. The photographs were graded by a reader who was masked as to the village and date of each photograph. Risk factor data on the family's socioeconomic status, distance to water, and hygiene practices were obtained at baseline. Follow-up examinations occurred 2, 6, and 12 months from baseline, Data from all four time points were available for 82% of the children enrolled. Overall, 10% of the children had constant, severe trachoma, defined as severe trachoma at three or four examinations. The odds ratio for severe trachoma was 1.9 for female children (95% confidence interval 1.3-2.7), Familiar cattle ownership and having one or more siblings with trachoma at baseline were also significantly related to the odds of having severe trachoma. Children with a sustainably clean face had lower odds (odds ratio = 0.4, 95% confidence interval 0.3-0.7), A subgroup of 10% of children in these hyperendemic communities always seemed to have severe trachoma, despite enrollment in a mass treatment campaign, Improved face-washing plus antibiotic treatment may decrease the likelihood that these children will be at risk for blinding complications in adulthood.

AB Computer simulation of population dynamics can be useful in managing harvested populations of monkeys on islands. Between 1988 and 1991, 420 adult female and 58 adult male simian retrovirus-free Macaca fascicularis were released onto Tinjil Island, Indonesia, to provide the nucleus for a free-ranging breeding colony. Natural habitat breeding facilities are excellent alternatives to wild trapping and compound breeding, maximizing the health and well-being of animals destined for essential biomedical research. To avoid a population crash, the number of offspring that can be harvested annually must be based on life table characteristics such as age-specific natality and mortality. We used a modified Leslie matrix to model changes in female population size over 26 years. First, we assumed that all 420 females were released simultaneously and varied the annual birth rate (50%, 60%, 70%), survival rate, and number of offspring harvested per year. Assuming high survival and birth rates vs. low rates, about four times as many female offspring could be harvested annually from a stable population (87 vs. 20 offspring). Terminal population size after 26 years did not differ much across rates modeled (568-696 females). Second, we modeled the number of females actually released (including the recent addition of 42 new female breeders) and harvested (averaging 49 annually 1991-1994), and projected the population through 2014. This indicated that threshold harvest rates and terminal population sizes increased considerably over the first model, assuming intermediate (78 harvested, 952 females) and high (152 harvested, 1,331 females) rates of survivorship and natality, but were unchanged assuming low rates (20 harvested, 559 females). A review of the literature and held observations on Tinjil suggest that actual birth and survival rates resemble the intermediate values modeled. If so, the present density on the island, projected to be similar to 215 males and females per square kilometer, is approaching carrying capacity. The high values are realistic upper limits. If actual survivorship and birth rates are at the high end of those modeled, the island's population may be on the verge of rapid expansion, requiring increased harvest and provisioning.

TI Nocturnal saturation improves by target-flow inspiratory muscle training
   in patients with COPD

AB Nocturnal desaturations during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, caused by nonobstructive hypoventilation, occur frequently in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This is partly caused by decreased activity of the intercostal and accessory muscles due to a lower motor command. The diaphragm has to compensate for the diminished activity of these muscles during REM sleep. However, in patients with COPD strength and endurance of the diaphragm may be affected by its unfavorable position on the length-tension curve because of hyperinflation. The aim of this study was to establish the causal relationship between respiratory muscle function and nocturnal saturation in patients with COPD. We hypothesized that target-flow inspiratory muscle training (TF-IMT) would improve nocturnal saturation. In 20 patients with stable COPD (FEV(1) 35.5 +/- 14.1% of predicted) and a mean nocturnal saturation below 92% we measured maximal inspiratory pressure (PImax), transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdi), maximal sustainable inspiratory pressure (SIPmax), endurance time, and nocturnal saturation in Weeks 0, 4, and 10. During these 10 wk 10 patients underwent TF-IMT at 60% of PImax and 10 control patients received sham TF-IMT at 10% of PImax. PImax, Pdi, SIPmax, and the endurance time as well as the nocturnal saturation improved significantly in the 60% training group (by 3.0 +/- 1.5 kPa, 3.4 +/- 1.9 kPa, 1.5 +/- 1.4 kPa, 189 +/- 149 s, and 1.9 +/- 2.2%, respectively), whereas no changes occurred in the sham training group. Also, significant correlations were observed between the changes in Pdi, SIPmax, and endurance time on the one hand and the change in nocturnal saturation on the other. We conclude that TF-IMT improves the nocturnal saturation in patients with severe COPD by increasing respiratory muscle strength and endurance.

AB Savanne Lake, Ontario is one of five lakes that have been closed to public fishing since 1969 to study the effects of exploitation on walleye. The study has four phases: preharvest (1972-79), harvest phase I (1980-85) simulating an angling fishery at an annual mean harvest level approximating 1.78 kg/ha, as recommended by the Ontario Provincial Guidelines, harvest phase II (1986-89) where the recommended mean harvest level was exceeded (1.95 kg/ha) in conjunction with a protected slot of 45 to 55 cm total length, and a recovery phase 1990 to the present. Prior to exploitation the adult walleye population density was averaging about 15/ha, then reduced to 10.5/ha in phase I, and 9.1/ha after phase II. Production and biomass also decreased. There was little change in the mean age of the population, declining slightly from 7 to 6.2 years. There were no significant changes in growth rates but condition factor and fecundity increased. Strong year classes were evident about every 4 to 6 years. About 78 percent of the strongest year-classes occurred in even-numbered years. We hypothesized that the pulse production of the mayfly (Hexagenia limbata), a major food item for walleye in Savanne, in even-numbered years enhances year-class strength of walleye. Year-class strength was positively correlated to young-of-the-year (YOY) abundance. The protected slot appeared to be ineffective in protecting the walleye biomass and production. Northern pike abundance was also reduced, although no cause-effect relationship has been established, considering that northern pike were not harvested. We suggest that an annual harvest of about 1.0 kg/ha, which is below the annual production of 1.39 kg/ha calculated for the unexploited population, can be sustained while providing a fishing experience approximating a remote unexploited lake. Harvest levels exceeding those recommended by our guidelines can quickly reduce population density, biomass and production, and have de-stabilizing effects on the community. This study shows that fish populations in small unproductive lakes can be impacted very quickly when harvest exceeds allowable levels. This study reaffirms the importance of long-term research to assess impacts of regulations on fish populations.

AB Heritage cities attract many visitors, generating benefits and costs. When the costs exceed the benefits, tourism development is no longer sustainable, and interventions become necessary. In order to develop guidelines to help heritage cities manage their tourism more adequately, the tourism market and policy of seven art cities were analyzed: Aix-en-Provence, Amsterdam, Bruges, Florence, Oxford, Salzburg and Venice. It was shown that tourism is menacing not only the vitality of their local economies, but also the integrity of their heritage and the quality of life of their residents. Measures to control and guide visitor flows are urgently needed. In reality, tourism management in the heritage cities does not go much further than promotion.

AB This paper begins with the premise that interpretation is the key to ensuring the quality of the tourism experience and argues that successful interpretation is critical both for the effective management and conservation of built heritage sites and for sustainable tourism. The paper introduces the concept of mindfulness and outlines its use in developing a model for designing effective interpretation at built heritage sites. A supporting set of principles for this design is provided. It is argued that mindfulness is an integrating concept that can be used to enhance the quality of visitor experiences and create a sustainable link between tourism and built heritage.

ID PADDLE WHEEL AERATORS; OXYGEN
AB Estuaries are used as both water source and effluent disposal areas for shrimp farms. Feeding rates rise as stocking densities and production levels increase; however; much of the feed is not assimilated into shrimp tissue, but instead becomes dissolved and particulate waste that may be discharged as shrimp pond water is exchanged or drained for harvesting Such nutrient enrichment of coastal waters by aquaculture effluents may be a significant concern in some areas. In the hypothetical intensive shrimp farm described here, water is recycled within the system, with discharges only to release excess water from precipitation or to maintain acceptable salinity. Water is not discharged at harvest but is held over winter between crops and then used again the next growing season. The primary crop of shrimp is co-cultured with oysters and herbivorous fish (mullet) to enhance solids removal and deposition and create other cash crops. The amount of nitrogen provided as feed is reduced by using feeds with less protein and better feed management The farm plan is modular with each 4-ha module consisting of: (1) three 1.0-ha shrimp monoculture ponds; (2) one 1.0-ha oyster-mullet polyculture and wafer treatment pond; (3) a small phytoplankton inoculation pond; (4) a solids settling basin; (5) sludge drying beds; and (6) upland use of pond sludge to improve agricultural land. The system is designed to produce 40 mt of whole shrimp, 7 mt of mullet, and approximately 0.5 million single select crysters/modtrle/year.

AB European hake Merluccius merluccius is the main commercial demersal species in the Gulf of Lions (Northwestern Mediterranean). This fish is exploited by French and Spanish trawler fleets and by small-scale fisheries using gillnets and longlines. Data on landings and the demography of catches by type of gear are now available for the period 1988-1991. The assessment of the hake stock was carried out using methods of virtual population analysis (VPA), or cohort analysis, based respectively on mean pseudocohorts and cohorts by age. The results of these VPA were then analysed and compared from a methodological point of view. The general results have confirmed previous studies with regard to the level of exploitation of the species. The two methods gave quite similar results for fishing mortality rates and for mean biomass. The maximal fishing mortality rate was observed at age 4, but it was already high at age 1, due to the exploitation of juveniles by trawlers. The mean biomass was about 7000 tons. The high values for turnover (about 80% or more) and for the maximal biomass/mean biomass ratio (23% or more) indicated a high level of exploitation but did not seem high enough to be dangerous for the stock. Yield-per-recruit analysis showed also that the present level of exploitation is far above the optimal sustainable level.

ID MODEL
AB A deterministic, forecasting, equilibrium study has been conducted of the multispecies and multi-metier fisheries of the Celtic Sea, ICES divisions VIIf and g. Calculations have been made of the optimal fleet sizes and mesh sizes required to maximize objectives of joint relative sustainable yields, gross revenue and net revenue. The species modelled are the resident populations of cod (Gadus morhua), whiting (Merlangius merlangus), sole (Solea solea), plaice (Pleuronectes platessa) and Norway lobster (Nephrops norvegicus), with additional consideration given to catches of hake (Merluccius merluccius), monkfish (Lophius sp.) and megrim (Lepidorhombus whiffiagonis). The fleet metiers modelled are the beam trawls, Nephrops otter trawls and non-Nephrops otter trawls. If mesh sizes can be calculated independently for each metier, then the yields and the gross revenue are maximized by increased effort and mesh sizes, especially in the non-Nephrops fleet. If a common mesh size is required for all fleets, then the yields and the gross revenue are maximized when (i) this mesh size is of 114 mm, (ii) the fishing effort in beam and Nephrops fleets is significantly increased, (iii) the non-Nephrops fleet is almost eliminated. Maximization of net revenue requires a mesh size similar to the current mesh of 80 mm, but with significant reductions of fishing effort in all fleets. Average profitability is increased by 50 millions EUROs per year for the Celtic Sea fishery. The model provides a basic structure for examining the management with a more realistic dynamic and stochastic description of the Celtic Sea fisheries.

AB 25 different muscles from 27 defined anatomical locations were taken from intensively fattened heifers providing carcass weights of 201 +/- 14 kg with an age of 377 +/- 42 days and evaluated in order to judge suitability for grilling or panfrying. Colour, pH, water-, fat- and collagen-content as well as solubility of collagen, cooking loss, Warner-Bratzler shear force and extension were measured in all muscles. Besides, ten muscles were evaluated for sensory firmness, juiciness, tenderness, flavour, sustainable juiciness, durable toughness and overall acceptance.
   Based on this results, tenderness and acceptance was estimated for the remaining muscles conducting multiple regression. Additionally, clustering and discriminant analysis provided a sufficient reliable classification of all muscles into quality classes. Results reveal, that - beside conventional steak-cuts - spinalis et semispinalis, rectus femoris and teres major of intensively fattened heifers may be well suitable to be used as steak. Second choice steaks may be obtained from gastrocnemius, infra spinatus, rectus abdominis, semimembranosus, serratus ventralis, tensor fascie latae and triceps brachii.

AB Estimates of the Greenlandic Norse population size were calculated based on two approaches: mathematical models, including both linear and stochastic models, and estimation from the total number of interred individuals in the Norse churchyards. The two approaches yielded remarkably similar results. This does not mean that the given population estimate is exact, but rather suggests that the estimates fall within a plausible range. The resultant population estimates indicate a peak population of some 2250 individuals and a cumulative population over the whole settlement period of 25,000. These estimates are lower than previous estimates, based mostly on number of farm buildings. The smaller numbers also allow for a scenario of depopulation by emigration. Due to the small population size, prolonged emigration over 200 years may well have brought the population below the minimum sustainable level.

AB Grain legume-cereal rotations are unsustainable on acid soils because they promote acidification of surface soil through nitrate leaching. Two field experiments were conducted on red, clay-loams in the cropping zone of central western New South Wales to determine whether soil mineral N concentrations during crop growth are higher under pea than barley, and whether the nitrate concentration under pea crops can be decreased by ammending soil with cereal straw before sowing.
   Significantly higher mineral N, particularly nitrate, was found under pea than under barley, as early as 6 weeks following autumn sowing, and also in spring. The pea effect represented an increase of up to 23 kg N/ha of mineral N (0-30 cm). It is proposed that the source of higher nitrate concentration under pea may be residual soil nitrate not utilised by pea, or nitrate derived from the mineralisation of pea roots or exudate.
   The increase in soil nitrate during pea growth contributes to greater postharvest soil mineral N and higher wheat yields after pea, but also increases the risk of soil acidification. Soil ammendment with cereal straw was partially effective in reducing nitrate concentration under pea, but a more effective treatment is required.

AB The recent history of dryland farming in the Australian semi-arid tropics is discussed briefly against the background of national and state policies, established following World War II, aimed at increasing the population and development of northern Australia. Some reference is also made to irrigation as a means of overcoming limitations imposed by rainfall and to complement dryland farming systems.
   The environmental and socio-economic constraints which have so far limited commercial agriculture in the Australian semi-arid tropics are highlighted. Efforts, particularly in north-west Australia, to develop sustainable fanning systems based on legume pasture leys and livestock production in conjunction with annual cropping, as a basis for closer settlement, are reviewed. These attempts, which began in the 1960s and stemmed from earlier post-war agricultural research in the region, initially relied on a pasture legume (Stylosanthes humilis cv. Townsville style) and conventional tillage. Farming system development continues today using new legume species (e.g. Stylosanthes hamata cv. Verano and Centrosema pascuorum cv. Cavalcade) and no-tillage cropping technology.
   This paper documents the history of agricultural and research development, and commercial practice in the Australian semi-arid tropics.

AB The extensive beef industry in the Northern Territory has been based almost exclusively upon native grass pastures for over a century. The recent development of an export trade for live cattle of specific age, weight and type, has increased returns over chilled manufacturing beef exports and has resulted in a demand for improved pastures that can support rapid growth of young cattle. This paper compares the potential of native grass pastures, legume ley pastures and permanent sown grass-legume pastures, in a range of configurations, to meet the market demand. Results of farming systems and sown pasture management experiments conducted at the Katherine Research Station are presented. Data from these experiments and other sources are used to explore options appropriate to the new market. Particular attention has been given to the time required for weaner steers to reach export target weights of 290-300 kg/head and the flexibility of systems to seasonal and animal variability.
   Permanent sown pastures are sustainable at stocking rates of about 2 steers/ha, but results indicate difficulty in maintaining legume dominance in the ley pastures, particularly if the cropping frequency is reduced. A proposal to use forage crops, rather than grain crops, to deplete soil nitrogen and reduce the incidence of weeds, is discussed.
   We recommend that ley pastures be retained as part of the management system, despite management difficulties, as they provide higher productivity and greater flexibility for farmers to meet the market requirements.

AB The results of 5 short-term (4-8 years) experiments and farm demonstrations in which no-tillage technology was compared with conventional or reduced tillage in the semi-arid tropics of the Northern Territory and Far North Queensland, during the mid 1980s to mid 1990s, are reviewed.
   In the Douglas-Daly and Katherine districts of the Northern Territory, dryland crops of maize, sorghum, soybean and mungbean sown using no-tillage with adequate vegetative mulch on the soil surface have produced yields comparable with, or higher than (especially in drier years), those obtained under conventional tillage. The importance of a surface mulch in ameliorating soil temperature, moisture and fertility, and in reducing soil movement and loss in crop production in the semi-arid tropics was confirmed.
   Management of mulch (pasture, crop residues and weeds) will be crucial in the application of no-tillage technology to the development of mixed dryland crop and livestock enterprises in the semi-arid tropics.

AB This paper examines some aspects of the economics of conservation tillage and ley farming in the semi-arid tropics of northern Australia. The distribution, value and major trends in the enterprises comprising the agricultural sector of the semi-arid tropics are discussed in an industry context.
   The likely economic benefits for the farmer from the adoption of conservation tillage and ley farming come from mulch retention and increased yields. These benefits vary with the frequency of grain cropping, the legume species used and the commodity price relativities. The benefits are likely to be larger in drier growing seasons. Data on other factors, such as soil type and seasons, were inadequate for economic analysis. Some ley fanning systems are more profitable than single enterprises in the short term. In the long term, the best choice for sustainable fanning systems in the semi-arid tropics appears to be a legume pasture system or a legume pasture-crop system. Results to date from ley farming studies show that experimental designs need to be modified to incorporate higher cropping frequencies and more comprehensive joint product measures in order to allow a more critical economic assessment.
   Additional benefits to society from the adoption of conservation tillage and ley farming are likely to come from minimising adverse on-farm and off-farm effects of agricultural activities.
   There are strong arguments for continuing support for research and development in ley farming technology and a joint sharing of the costs between farmers and the community generally.

TI Soil management and production of Alfisols in the semi-arid tropics .4.
   Simulation of decline in productivity caused by soil erosion
SO AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF SOIL RESEARCH

AB Maintenance of a productive soil base by minimizing soil erosion is vital to long-term crop production. In this study, a modelling approach is used to estimate the effects of soil erosion on productivity for a sorghum cropping system on an Alfisol in the semi-arid tropics of India. Predictions of erosion, runoff and yield decline due to erosion, for variations in initial soil depth, slope, tillage strategy and amendment treatment, are presented.
   On average, soil depth decreased by 0.91 cm/year at Hyderabad for a 10% slope, 80 cm initial soil depth, shallow tillage at planting and no surface amendment. Rates of soil removal and subsequent yield decline were higher for shallower soils, steeper slopes and if management practices provided less surface cover during the crop. The productive life of the soil was less than 91 years for some soil depths, slope and management combinations. For other combinations, significant yield decline was predicted after 91 years of cropping.
   The quantification of erosion-productivity relationships allows us to identify regions with a higher risk of degradation from soil erosion and to estimate the impact of various management options on long-term sustainability. Models provide a basis to focus research and a means of assessing alternative management strategies to preserve long-term production.

AB This paper examines the impact of biotechnology for enhancing the quality of the environment, and the necessity of encouraging holistic approaches to environmental problem solving. Current actions are considered wanting because they place insufficient attention on the causes of environmental degradation. In this context, a number of issues and research agendas are presented, a consideration of which leads me to opine that urgent priorities for ensuring lasting sustainable development must include the widespread adoption of clean technology and ecosystem restoration. Biotechnology has a particularly decisive role to play in realizing clean processes and clean products, and this role is illustrated with reference to clean technology options in the industrial, agroforestry, food, raw materials, and minerals sectors. A quarter of a century ago Commoner (1971) used the metaphor of a closing circle to draw attention to incompatibilities of modern industrial society and ecological health. The second part of this paper argues that, as biotechnology has matured, a circle of synergistic flows of materials, services and ideas has been established between it and biodiversity and suggests a more optimistic scenario to that portrayed by Commoner. The closing of the biotechnology-biodiversity circle is manifest in the following terms: search and discovery; detection, circumscription and phylogeny; ecosystem function and restoration; industrial ecology; and the gearing provided by molecular biology. Finally, the North-South biotechnology-biodiversity circle presents critical problems of commercial exploitation and intellectual property rights in relation to the gene pools of the megadiversity but predominantly developing countries of the world.

AB In order to determine how dependent a woody legume can be upon potential N sources, the time course of N-2 fixation and N absorption was studied on Gliricidia sepium cv. ILG50, Leucaena leucocephala cv. K28, and Albizia lebbeck in a screenhouse for 16 months using Senna siamea as a reference tree. Dry matter and N yield in all four species increased steadily with time. The numbers and dry weight of nodules also increased with tree age. N-difference and N-15 dilution methods correlated well (r = 0.87-0.93) in defining an increasing pattern of N-2 fixation with time in ail species, with the highest increment rate between sowing and 8 months. The percent N-2 fixed ranged from 17.9 to 74%, 27.7 to 71.9% and 43.6 to 83.6%, equivalent to 191 to 3385 mg, 321 to 2863 mg and 533 to 6419 mg N in Leucaena, Gliricidia and Albizia, respectively, for the period between 4 and 16 months. In contrast to others, G. sepium had its peak of amount of N-2 fixed at 12 months after planting. In both the proportion and amount of N-2 fixed over time, A. lebbeck was superior to L. leucocephala and G. sepium which were similar. The proportion of plant N derived from absorption (soil+fertilizer) over time decreased inversely to the increase in symbiotic N-2 fixation, with soil being the predominant source. This study evidenced the benefit of relying on N-2-fixing woody legumes as sustainable N-supplying sources to soil-crop systems.

AB A detailed ecological analysis of the energetics and biomass utilization patterns of the existing traditional hill agroecosystems in three different localities/villages situated along an alititudinal transect in the outer Garhwal Himalaya was performed in order to understand the functions of the hill agroecosystem in relation to current environmental perspectives.
   In general, the energy efficiency (considering green biomass obtained from agroforestry tree species, weeds and herbaceous vegetation growing on the bunds as an auxiliary output) of the agroecosystems of this region is low. The annual energy output and input ratio on a per hectare basis was maximal (5.80) for Jaidevpur village (lower altitude), followed by Dalimsain (middle altitude) and Hathnur (higher altitude). Since Jaidevpur is located in the foot hills where the agricultural land is flat and completely irrigated, and people also practice semi-mechanized agriculture, grain yield was observed to be higher than in Dalimsain and Hathnur. However, in the absence of agroforestry tree species in Jaidevpur, people were forced to depend more on the forests for their fodder, fuelwood and other requirements than in Dalimsain and Hathnur, where the agroforestry component was found to be strong. Dalimsain derived only 5% of its total fodder demand from the forest while Hathnur was observed to be self-sufficient in fodder and fuelwood requirements. Further, on rainfed, terraces the grain yield was higher for the kharif season (April-October) crops than the rabi season (November-March) crops, owing to the availability of rain water during the monsoon. The characteristic feature of the hill agroecosystem was its organic base. Farmyard manure was observed to be the main input in to the agroecosystems.
   Agriculture in the hill areas is not easily adapted to industrialized techniques, partly because of the topography and partly because of socio-economic considerations. In the face of the prevailing environmental conditions, with natural resources declining at a rapid rate, the efficiency and sustainability of the hill agroecosystems should be restored through the strengthening of the agroforestry component and efficient biomass utilization employing appropriate technological inputs. Such technologies should build upon the empirical knowledge of the local people and their perceptions. In addition to this incorporation of technological inputs, short term economic benefits should be included in any development programme at the same time as long term strategies. This type of approach would be appreciated by the local communities and would readily find their acceptance and effective participation in the programme.

ID CROP
AB For three consecutive cropping seasons, plantain (Musa AAB), established at 1667 plants ha(-1), was intercropped with melons: egusi melon (Citrullus lanatus) followed by water melon (Citrullus lanatus) followed by egusi melon. The aim was to assess the compatibility of plantain with melons. The populations of melon used were 3333, 5000 and 6666 plants ha(-1). Leaf area of plantain was significantly decreased by intercropping with 5000 and 6666 melon plants ha(-1). Intercropping did not significantly influence bunch yield of plantain but it caused a 2-7 and 20% yield decrease in egusi melon and water melon respectively. Land Equivalent Ratios (LER) of the intercropped plots were 1.67, 1.69 and 1.74 respectively. Cash advantage due to intercropping (CAI) values for plantain intercropped with 3333, 5000 and 6666 melon plants ha(-1) were N61400, N65700 and N72100 ha(-1) respectively. The plantain-melon mixture is proferred as an alternative sustainable mixture to existing plantain-based mixed cropping systems.

ID LIZARDS; REPRODUCTION
AB The Asian water monitor Varanus salvator is the second-largest lizard species in the world (to > 1 m SVL, 2 . 5 m total, 20 kg), and is heavily exploited (> 1 million skins per annum). In the course of three trips between August 1993 and April 1995, we gathered information on 166 water monitors captured in southern Sumatra for the commercial skin trade. Relatively equal numbers of males and females were captured but the males were almost all adults whereas half of the females were juveniles. Sex ratios and body sizes did not vary significantly among the three trips. Males grow larger than females, but the largest animals are not used in the leather trade. Males mature at around 40 cm SVL (= 1 m total, 1 kg), and females at around 50 cm. Maturation thus occurs at a small proportion of maximum size, as is typical for large species of reptiles. Adult males ave more heavy-bodied than females, and have longer tails, but fat stores did not differ between the sexes. Prey items included crustaceans, rats and other varanids, but most lizards were kept for so long prior to slaughter that the stomach was empty of food. All adult-size males had active gonads, but testes were larger in April than in October. All adult females in the August and April samples were reproductively active, but less activity was evident in October. The egg-laying season extends from April to October (at least), and most female water monitors in southern Sumatra produce multiple clutches each year. Larger females begin to breed earlier in the year than do smaller animals. Clutch sizes ranged from five to 22, and were positively correlated with maternal body size. We measured stretched and dried skins from processed lizards to establish a predictive equation linking lizard SVL to skin width. The persistence of water monitors in southern Sumatra, despite intense harvesting reflects the large area of suitable habitat with low human densities, combined with the monitors' ecological flexibility (in habitat and diets), their high reproductive rate (early maturation and frequent reproduction), and (perhaps) the concentration of commercial harvesting on adult males. At current levels, the commercial trade may extirpate varanids from local areas but will not drive the species to extinction. (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd

AB Hunting bag data for Namaqua sandgrouse Pterocles namaqua from an estate near Kimberley, South Africa, for the period 1907-1992 were analysed to investigate population trends, environmental correlates and to develop predictive models for population fluctuations An apparent population decline between 1950 and 1992 may be an artifact of increased sandgrouse dispersion in response to an increased number of artificial watering points on the estate, and in the surrounding area, during this latter period. Peaks in sandgrouse abundance are significantly negatively correlated with December rainfall and significantly positively correlated with March rainfall. Furthermore, annual sandgrouse abundance and March rainfall showed similar peaks at four-year cycles during 1909-1939. Therefore, a rainfall 'score' which takes cognizance of both December and March rainfall is useful for predicting annual sandgrouse abundance before the forthcoming hunting season. However, correct predictions of low sandgrouse abundance were more common than correct predictions of high sandgrouse abundance. These environmental correlates and predictive models are useful for forecasting the annual viability of commercial hunting of these populations.

ID CORAL REEFS; RESERVES
AB Effective management of Seychelles' reef resources is essential because the conflicting demands of fishing, tourism and conservation must be reconciled if sustainable development and the protection of natural resources is to be assured. Marine protected areas play a key role in the existing management strategy and yet there is little quantitative understanding of the benefits they may provide. We compare the biomass and species richness of fish assemblages on coral and granitic reef habitats in four areas which receive different levels of protection from fishing and other human activities. Species richness of the total fish community, biomass of the total fish community and species richness and biomass of many families were higher on both coralline and granitic reefs in two marine protected areas where protective regulations were effectively enforced However, the biomass of the three principal families of fishes targeted by the fishery was significantly lower in one of these areas. This was attributed to illegal fishing and the fishing concessions offered to local people. We conclude that poaching and minor fishing concessions did not affect the aspects of the fish community which ave important to most tourist visitors (biomass and overall species richness), but that they have a statistically significant effect on the structure of the fish community. Furthermore, whilst a small well-patrolled area will provide an effective refuge from fishing, it will often be stocked by larval fishes which are the progeny of adults living many kilometres away. As such, the protected area cannot operate in isolation to maintain biomass and diversity. A valid longterm aim of reserve management may be to assure the protection of a greater proportion of Seychelles' fishes throughout their life history. This may be achieved if current plans for the management of marine protected areas can be instituted.

ID MATURITY INDEX; COLONIZATION
AB Recolonization of soils by organisms is dependent not only on biological factors but also on site factors including soil and vegetation. The total nematode populations in soil sterilized 52 months earlier with methyl bromide ranged from 77 to 123% of those in untreated soil; both vegetation and rainfall appear to have been important factors in the recolonization. In a high-rainfall pasture the dominant plant-feeding nematode Helicotylenchus did not recolonize and was replaced by Paratylenchus. Under high rainfall, Iotonchus failed to recolonize either pasture or forest, but Clarkus recolonized well. While indices such as the maturity index, the summed maturity index, PPI, the ratio of fungal: bacterial feeding nematodes, species richness, the Shannon-Weaver index, and indices of evenness, dominance, and diversity showed various effects, none gave consistent trends; rainfall and vegetation probably exerted too much influence. In the light of trends in our data, in data for other ecosystems, and the reality of r-K strategies in animals, it may not be reasonable to expect a global ''nematode index'' of ''soil health'' or ecosystem condition. While a ''nematode index'' may be useful in local or regional studies, research efforts may be better directed towards elucidating ''key populations'' of nematodes for investigating the impact of particular land management practices on ecosystem sustainability.

AB We examined the effects of conifers on the forms of P in low-fertility tussock grassland soils using P-31 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and soil P fractionation, Results from field and glasshouse experiments clearly demonstrated that conifers enhanced the mineralization of labile (and to a lesser extent more resistant) forms of soil organic P which, in turn, increased amounts of labile inorganic P in the soil. These findings have important implications for P availability and long-term sustainable management of grassland soils in New Zealand.

AB Organic-N fertilizers in the form of flood-tolerant, leguminous, stem-nodulating Sesbania rostrata and Aeschynomene afraspera may be useful alternatives to resource-poor rice farmers if applied as green manure. Therefore, the accumulation of N by these green manure species and their effect on the performance and yield of wetland rice (IR 64) was examined at four different sites in Luzon, Philippines. Soils deficient in N, P, and K were selected and compared with the fertile Maahas day of the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) at Los Banos. The green manure plants were, grown under flooded ed conditions for 49 days in the wet season of 1987, chopped, and then ploughed in before transplanting rice seedlings. In a second experiment, the effect of S. rostrata green manure was studied under rainfed conditions. All green manure treatments were compared to an urea treatment (60 kg N ha(-1)) and an untreated control. Both legumes developed well, even on the marginally productive soils. S. rostrata accumulated up to 190 kg N ha(-1) and A. afraspera even accumulated 196 kg N ha(-1) in the shoots. In all treatments, green manure increased grain yield significantly (P = 0.05) over the untreated control, by 1.3 - 1.7 Mg ha(-1). The yields were comparable to those obtained with 60 kg N ha(-1) of urea fertilizer. S. rostrata caused the highest grain yield, of 6.5 Mg ha(-1) on the Maahas clay soil of IRRI. The apparent release of exchangeable NH4+-N in the soils after green manuring and the rice grain yield response Showed that both green manure species may provide sufficient available N throughout the development of IR 64 in the wet season. In the rainfed marginal soil site, green manure with S. rostrata produced even higher rice grain yields than urea. Green manure therefore seems particularly attractive for poor farmers on marginally productive soils, at least as a temporary strategy to improve yield and yield sustainability.

DT Article
DE household energy; fuelwood; biomass; demand; supply; model
AB Data on fuelwood harvesting, construction timber requirements and the number of people in two settlements in the Eastern Transvaal Lowveld (Athol and Welverdiend) is combined with woody biomass information in the form of a numerical model. This allows the investigation of the relationship between woodland supply and local wood demand. The effects of uncertainty in primary data collection, and of possible changes to the harvesting pressure on the woodland are illustrated. Given the assumptions of the model, current harvest rates around Athol are shown to be sustainable, although the increase in wood demand resulting from an estimated population growth rate of 3% will cause woodland stocks to decline after 20 years. The Welverdiend model shows a marked imbalance between available supply and demand. Continuation of current harvesting practice would lead to severe deforestation within 15 years. The investigative scenarios presented emphasize the advantages to be gained from rapid reduction in woody biomass harvesting, resulting in better long term sustainable harvests. The significant changes in per capita fuelwood harvest would however seriously impact on households, and it is thus important that the models be utilized within a much broader holistic framework in the development of solutions appropriate to local areas.

ID ENERGY
AB Bioethanol production from agricultural raw materials can be carried out to produce liquid fuels and reduce CO2 emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels and hence its impact on climate. Crop production and transformation processes have been investigated by the traditional energy and carbon analyses and the more recent emergy analysis. The latter is able to account for, on the same basis, both renewable and non-renewable inputs, including goods and labour involved in a process.
   The combination of such analyses provides a deeper insight into the problems of converting biomass to fuel. In particular it is shown that emergy analysis can evaluate long-term sustainability and comparisons of emergy-based indices can be used to compare efficiency and environmental input between various production systems.

AB Biomass, produced in an economically and environmentally sustainable manner, could realistically be used to supply 50,000 MW (5 quads) of electric capacity by the year 2010, and probably twice that amount by the year 2030.
   Since 1992, the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) and the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) have each been independently evaluating the potential for biomass to become a major renewable energy resource over the next four decades, capable of offsetting some of the U.S. dependency on fossil fuels while also offering important environmental and economic benefits. This paper presents EPRI's conclusions, which are more conservative than those of the U.S. DOE, and outlines possible strategies by which EPRI can advance acceptance of biomass as a preferred renewable resource.

ID DIVERSITY
AB Power generation using biomass could provide substantial environmental and socio-economic benefits. Production of the feedstocks to fuel biomass power plants can either add to potential environmental gains or contribute to the environmental problems which the agriculture and forestry industries already face. Likewise, the biomass energy infrastructure can help strengthen agricultural economies or speed the decline of rural communities. The purpose of this paper is to suggest a regional approach to ensure that energy crop production will proceed in an ecologically and economically sustainable way.
   At this juncture, we have the opportunity to build into the system some ecological and socio-economic values which have not traditionally been considered. If crop species are chosen and sited properly, incorporation of energy crops into our agricultural system could provide extensive wildlife habitat and address soil and water quality concerns, in addition to generating renewable power. We recommend that three types of agricultural land be targeted for perennial biomass energy crops: (1) highly erodible land; (2) wetlands presently converted to agricultural uses; and (3) marginal agricultural land in selected regions. Fitting appropriate species to these lands, biomass crops can be successfully grown on lands nor ecologically suited for conventional farming practices, thus providing an environmental benefit in addition to producing an economic return to the land owner.

TI Using community health workers for malaria control: Experience in Zaire
SO BULLETIN OF THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION
LA English
DT Article
ID KIVU MOUNTAINS; MORTALITY; CHILDREN; CARE; MORBIDITY
AB The potential for using community health workers (CHW) for administering timely and effective treatment for presumptive malaria attacks was evaluated in the Katana health zone in Zaire. In each of the 12 villages of an intervention area (area A) with 13000 inhabitants, a CHW was trained in the use of a simple fever management algorithm. The CHWs performed their services under the supervision of the nurse in charge of the area's health centre (HC). Malaria morbidity and mortality trends were monitored during 2 years in area A and in an ecologically comparable control area (area B), where malaria treatment continued to be available at the HC only. Health care behaviour changed dramatically in the intervention area, and by the end of the observation period 65% of malaria episodes were treated at the community level. Malaria morbidity declined 50% in area A but remained stable in the control area. Parasitological indices showed similar trends. Malaria-specific mortality rates remained, however, at essentially the same levels in both areas. The non-comprehensiveness of the CHWs' care and their ambiguous position in the health care system created problems that compromise the sustainability of the intervention.

ID DIARRHEAL DISEASES; INFANT-MORTALITY; CHILDREN; IMPACT
AB An integrated water supply, sanitation and hygiene (WSH) education intervention project was run by the international Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh, over the period 1983-87. In the intervention area the project provided handpumps, pit latrines, and hygiene education to about 800 households. The control population did not receive any interventions, but had access to the usual government and private WSH facilities. After 1987 no external support was provided to maintain these provisions. A cross-sectional follow-up survey which was carried out in 1992, involved about 500 randomly selected households from the intervention and control areas.
   In 1992 about 82% of the pumps were still in good functional condition and of these, 94% had been functioning well in 1987. Fewer latrines were functional in 1992 (64%) than at the end of 1987 (93%). In the former intervention area about 84% of the adults were using sanitary latrines in 1992 compared with only 7% in the control area. Knowledge related to disease transmission, however, was poor and similar in both areas. People claimed that they used the WSH facilities to improve the qualify of their lives. The prevalence of diarrhoeal diseases in the 1992 survey among the control population was about twice that among those in the intervention area.

TI Impact of nutrition education and mega-dose vitamin A supplementation on

SO BULLETIN OF THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION
LA English
DT Article
ID CHILDHOOD MORTALITY; DISEASE; CARE
AB The impact on vitamin A deficiency (VAD), wasting malnutrition, and excessive childhood mortality of two alternative approaches -- nutrition education and mega-dose capsule distribution (6-12-month-olds: 100 000 IU; 1-5-year-olds: 200 000 IU) -- in communities in Nepal are compared. Approximately 40 000 children from 75 locations in seven districts in two ecological settings (lowland and hills) took part in the study and were randomly allocated to intervention cohorts or a control group.
   At 24 months after the implementation of the project the reduction of risk for xerophthalmia was greater among children whose mothers were able to identify vitamin-A-rich foods (relative risk (RR) = 0.25; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.10-0.62) than among the children who received mega-dose capsules (RR = 0.59; 95% CI = 0.41-0.84). The risk of mortality at 2 years was reduced for both the nutrition education (RR = 0.64; 95% CI = 0.48-0.86) and capsule distribution (RR = 0.57; 95% CI = 0.42-0.77) cohorts. The nutrition education programme was, however, more expensive to deliver than the capsule distribution programme. High rates of participation for children in the supplementation programme were achieved quickly. The nutrition education messages also spread rapidly throughout the study population (regardless of intervention cohort assignment). Practices, however, were slower to change. In communities where maternal literacy was low and channels of communication were limited the capsule distribution programme appeared to be more economical. However, there are economies of scale for nationwide education programmes that do not exist for capsule distribution programmes. Although nutrition education provides economies of scale and the promise of long-term sustainability, a comprehensive national programme requires both dietary supplementation and nutrition education components.

TI Control of intestinal parasitic infections in Seychelles: A
   comprehensive and sustainable approach
SO BULLETIN OF THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION

DT Article
ID HELMINTHS; ASCARIS
AB Intestinal parasitic infections have been perceived as a public health problem in Seychelles for decades. A comprehensive strategy to reduce morbidity and, in the long term, transmission of intestinal parasites has been implemented successfully since 1993. Management of the programme is integrated into the well established primary health care system, with control activities being undertaken through existing health facilities. The strategy is based on periodic chemotherapy of schoolchildren, intense health education and improvement of sanitation and safe water supply. The initial objectives of the control programme were met after 2 years of activities, with an overall reduction in prevalence of intestinal parasitic infections of 44%. The intensity of infection with Trichuris trichiura, the commonest parasite, was halved (from 780 to 370 eggs per g of faeces). The programme's integrated approach, in concert with political commitment and limited operational costs, is a warranty for the future sustainability of control activities. The programme can be seen as a model for other developing countries, even where health and socioeconomic conditions are different and the control of parasitic infections will need a much longer-term commitment.

AB Ecological properties essential for the survival and production of a lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) population can be placed in a hierarchical framework. Prior to any consideration of yield potential, it must be determined that the lake is capable of supporting a self-sustaining lake trout population, with surplus production available for a fishery. The steps required to perform this assessment and determine yield expectations are outlined. Initially, the lake is plotted along a continuum of mean depth and primary productivity to evaluate whether the critical temperature and oxygen requirements of lake trout are met. A review of other physical habitat attributes essential for the success of the population follows, such as the availability of spawning substrate and nursery refugia. If the fundamental environmental and physical habitat needs are met, a viable lake trout population could be expected, and an evaluation of harvest potential is appropriate. An estimate is made first of total community yield, then of the sustainable harvest of lake trout alone, applying thermal habitat volume and lake area models. Finally, adjustments are made to this estimate through consideration of modifiers that may constrain lake trout production, including community biodiversity and various anthropogenic stressors. Small lakes (<1000 ha) are most affected by these constraints.

AB Sustainable management of regions and watersheds presents a quandary. Because of the large scale of regions and of the environmental problems associated with them, sustainable management is best directed by an entity with a large purview. However, experience suggests that effective and efficient solutions to environmental problems are best developed by involving natural and social scientists possessing knowledge of fundamental principles in their respective disciplines with local stakeholders who understand both the local resources and the users of those resources. The last decade has seen a shift toward consideration of the ''human dimensions'' of natural resource management. Nearly 20 years ago, a mechanism was created in Massachusetts to provide advice on sustainability of water resources: the reasons for the success of that mechanism are worth examining today. Through the creation of a Citizens Advisory Committee, there was agreement among scientists, managers, planners, and policymakers to adopt a landscape perspective, using natural rather than political boundaries in setting management goals as well as for development of the institutional arrangements necessary for management of ecological systems.

AB Computerised decision support systems offer an ideal means of achieving economical, environmentally safe, and sustainable weed management. Systems based on weed economic threshold concepts have been developed in the United States and Europe. In several of these, weed density is the sole variable used for estimating crop yield losses due to weeds. In Canada, there have been few attempts to develop computerised decision support systems to facilitate rational weed management. A notable exception is a microcomputer program developed by the Manitoba Department of Agriculture for assessing the economics of wild oat (Avena fatua L.) control in cereal and oilseed crops. A relative time of emergence variable is a crucial component of the program. There is a need to develop a more comprehensive system for managing multiple weed species in a range of crops grown in Canada. For reliable recommendations to be made, input requirements for the system should include information on the relative time of emergence of the crop and weed, crop density, environmental factors and method of fertilizer application, as well as weed density. In terms of output, the system should indicate realistic weed monitoring procedures, and the long-term bioeconomic implications of seed production by uncontrolled weeds.

AB Studies on crop production are traditionally carried out by using conventional experience-based agronomic research, in which crop production functions were derived from statistical analysis without referring to the underlying biological or physical principles involved. The weaknesses and disadvantages of this approach and the need for greater in-depth analysis have long been recognized. Recently, application of the knowledge-based systems approach to agricultural management has been gaining popularity because of our expanding knowledge of processes that are involved in the growth of plants, coupled with the availability of inexpensive and powerful computers. The systems approach makes use of dynamic simulation models of crop growth and of cropping systems. In the most satisfactory crop growth models, current knowledge of plant growth and development from various disciplines, such as crop physiology, agrometeorology, soil science and agronomy, is integrated in a consistent, quantitative and process-oriented manner. After proper validation, the models are used to predict crop responses to different environments that are either the result of global change or induced by agricultural management and to test alternative crop management options.
   Computerized decision support systems for field-level crop management are now available. The decision support systems for agrotechnology transfer (DSSAT) allows users to combine the technical knowledge contained in crop growth models with economic considerations and environmental impact evaluations to facilitate economic analysis and risk assessment of farming enterprises. Thus, DSSAT is a valuable tool to aid the development of a viable and sustainable agricultural industry. The development and validation of crop models can improve our understanding of the underlying processes, pinpoint where our understanding is inadequate, and, hence, support strategic agricultural research. The knowledge-based systems approach offers great potential to expand our ability to make good agricultural management decisions, not only for the current climatic variability, but for the anticipated climatic changes of the future.

AB The operation/validity of soil and plant analysis is hampered by a lack of confidence in its relevance under field conditions. This deficit can be overcome by employing georeferred strategies within the Local Resource Management (LRM). Georeferred and sophisticated sampling strategies together with new approaches for data evaluation and decision making will improve the quality of soil and plant analysis in terms of a better utilization of resources and reduced environmental burdens.

AB As population pressure keeps increasing, productive land in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is becoming increasingly scarce, while soil fertility research in SSA is shifting its focus away from production per se towards sustainable production. The vital role of spatial and temporal scales and their heterogeneity is highlighted in this paper. Spatial variation of soil nutrient stocks is shown for agro-ecological zones and soil classification units in East and West Africa, but also at the farm level and lower levels. Whereas researchers have traditionally focussed much on macrovariability, SSA farmers tend to cherish and maintain microvariability. Meanwhile, soil nutrient stocks are not static entities. On the contrary, studies in different parts of Africa, and at different spatial scales, show that they are being depleted at alarming rates as nutrients are annually taken away in crops or lost in processes, such as leaching and erosion which far exceed the nutrient inputs through fertilizers, deposition, and biological fixation. This shows how the absence of spatial and temporal variation in models based on soil fertility variables strongly diminishes their predictive value, and the role attributed to them in supporting land-use planning and farm household decision-making. An attempt should be made to quantify and monitor the different nutrient flows that play a role on farms and at higher levels of aggregation. It is argued that improved soil fertility can be achieved through integrated nutrient management (INM), as this scientific field is presently replacing traditional fertilizer research. Calculating and monitoring nutrient flows and quantifying the impact of INM systems on soil fertility, and hence on agricultural production and its sustainability, is a high priority issue. The shift of the research focus to INM systems implies a broader mandate and greater responsibility for soil and plant analytical laboratories in SSA.

AB The fertilization of phosphorus (P) fertilizers is essential in agricultural production, but phosphates contain in dependence on their origin different amounts of trace elements. The problem of cadmium (Cd) loads and other heavy metals is well known. However, only a limited number of investigations examined the contamination of phosphates with the two heaviest metals, uranium (U) and thorium (Th), which are radioactive. Also potassium (K) is lightly radioactive. Measurements are done on the radioactivity content of phosphates, P fertilizers and soils. The radiation doses to workers and public as well as possible contamination of soils from phosphate rock or fertilizer caused by these elements or their daughter products is of interest with regard to radiation protection. The use of P fertilizers is necessary for a sustainable agriculture, but it involves radioactive contamination of soils. The consequences of the use of P fertilizers is discussed, also with regard to existing and proposed legislation.

AB Tunas are pelagic, continuous swimmers, with numerous specializations for achieving a high aerobic scope. Tunas must maintain a high rate of energy turnover, and therefore require elevated levels of aerobic performance in multiple physiological functions simultaneously. Based on a model of oxygen demand and delivery to the swimming musculature, the yellowfin's total oxygen consumption at the predicted maximum sustainable (aerobic) swimming velocity is well below estimates of its maximum oxygen consumption. This suggests that the high aerobic scope of tunas may be a specialization that permits continuous swimming in addition to supplying oxygen to other metabolic functions. Estimates of the metabolic costs of oxygen-debt repayment, growth, and specific dynamic action have been combined with this model of aerobic swimming performance to evaluate the total energy budget in relation to the aerobic scope of the yellowfin tuna. Repayment of the oxygen debt incurred during burst swimming is potentially a large component of tuna respiratory metabolism and the relatively high aerobic capacity of tuna white muscle may be a specialization for rapid lactate clearance.

AB Many studies of high-performance fishes focus on tunas because they are morphologically adapted for efficient swimming, they migrate long distances and accelerate rapidly, and they successfully exploit the epipelagic marine environment. Tunas have also received attention because, by conserving metabolically generated heat, they elevate the temperature of certain tissues above ambient water temperature; that is, they are endothermic. However, few studies have used phylogenetically based comparisons to determine what is unique about tunas and to elucidate evolutionary trends. This paper compares tunas with their closest relatives, ectothermic fishes of the family Scombridae, and examines characteristics of the myotomal musculature that are related to swimming performance. White muscle anaerobic capacity is significantly greater in tunas chan in ectothermic scombrid fishes, indicating that energy generation for bursts may be greater in tunas. Because tunas have high capacities to buffer metabolic acids within the white muscle and blood, and to recover from exhaustive exercise rapidly, they may be able to burst repeatedly. The white muscle of tunas also has a higher aerobic capacity than that of ectothermic scombrids, which may indicate chat at lease some tuna white muscle fibers are recruited at sustainable speeds or it may be related to rapid lactate turnover or growth races. In contrast, many intracellular characteristics of the red myotomal muscle do not differ significantly between tunas and ectothermic scombrid fishes. Many of these, including mitochondrial ATP production rate and muscle contraction speed, are temperature dependent and are higher at. the higher in vivo red muscle temperatures of tunas. Thus, endothermy may result in elevated aerobic performance levels in tunas, and their high blood hemoglobin concentrations, muscle myoglobin contents, and red muscle capillary densities would ensure adequate oxygen delivery to the active, warm red muscle fibers. However, direct tests of this hypothesis are needed. Much more remains to be learned about tunas and ectothermic scombrids so that more complete phylogenetic analyses can be used to understand the adaptive strategies that have resulted in tunas' success as active epipelagic predators.

AB Sustainable (aerobic) swimming performance in yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) is examined through a model estimating red muscle oxygen demand and the cardiovascular system's capacity for oxygen delivery. At maximum oxygen delivery (25 degrees C), red muscle oxygen consumption (V over dot O(2)RM) is estimated to be 0.197 ml O-2/g/min, which is higher than previous estimates of maximum V over dot O(2)RM. However, due to the high costs of swimming at high speeds, maximum sustained velocity at this rate would only be 3.7 fork lengths/s, which is lower than previous estimates for yellowfin. Hypoxia and reduced ambient temperature that may be encountered by yellowfin in the course of their natural movement patterns will decrease oxygen delivery capacity through effects on the cardiovascular system, limiting maximum V over dot O(2)RM. Moderate swimming velocities could, however, be maintained at an oxygen tension of 75 mmHg, and at an ambient temperature of 15 degrees C.

AB Malaria in Kenya has been characterised by marked variability in its epidemiology, partly reflecting the obstacles and progress made in the control strategies. The impact of anti-vector activities in the 1970s and before have been observed for variable lengths of time afterwards. Malaria has re-emerged in areas previously with little or no transmission. The recovery of infective Anopheles gambiae vector in higher altitudes affirms the potential for transmission in areas where epidemics have been known to occur. Morbidity and mortality patterns in the otherwise endemic lowlands have become increasingly severe, an observation which would be attributed to the increasing inefficacy of chloroquine. Efforts to promote personal protection suffer substantial setbacks in sustainability inspite of apparent acceptability. There are indications that the mosquito vector susceptibility to permethrin and other insecticides will now require continual monitoring in order to detect development of significant resistance. In this communication, we review some emergent issues in malaria transmission in Kenya and the potential for control as adduced from historical and contemporary perspectives.

AB Resource degradation has a profound influence on food sustainability of developing economies. The breakdown of traditional institutions enhanced this problem and needs an institutional approach. Many of the traditional policies, like regulation and taxation, have failed to deliver the required benefits. This paper uses Principal-Agency theory to develop a criterion for incentive design. Three incentive structures are developed based on contractual agreements and restructured property rights that use the criterion. Two case studies were used to discuss the new institutional arrangement. Some practical implications of the mechanisms designed include linearity of incentive rules, development of an effort-reward matrix, and gradual reinstatement of local governance.

AB Balsam fir (Abies balsamea) is a shade-tolerant conifer that experiences striking growth suppression from browsing of the understory of mixed, boreal-type forests of Isle Royale, Michigan, where it forms an important component of moose (Alces alces) diet in winter. Suppression increases with increasing canopy cover and forest age. However, response to an individual, severe browsing episode cannot be generalized in terms of suppression. Such shorter-term responses are best investigated by experimentation.
   Artificial removal of foliage from understory balsam fir in two sites on Isle Royale and one mainland site showed that damage such as reduced terminal growth and complete mortality was actually highest among least suppressed trees. Canopy cover produced a secondary effect, in which trees experiencing >60% cover were unable to compensate for removal by clipping. Among less suppressed trees, competition for limited light produced an apically oriented morphology that countered the laterally oriented morphology associated with suppression. Higher vulnerability to the artificial browsing occurred because trees were no longer protected by snow cover. By the second growing season following clipping, surviving clipped trees even in the most damaged sites resumed the same growth as controls. Over the long term, suppression may be a means by which fir remains alive when subjected to continuous browsing. Over the shorter term, delayed growth recovery following severe browsing in an unsuppressed understory may also contribute to sustainability in Isle Royale's plant-herbivore system.

AB Sustainable development is possible to understand as a process or programme of change of economic, technical and social relations in the interest of nature preservation and forming suitable environment for present and future generations. In the following contribution we evaluate the present environmental situation on the territory of Slovakia, which creates one from among basic conditions for sustainable development of the territory. Following bases were decisive at this evaluation:
   a) Determination of main positive and negative inputs, elaboration of analytical bases (threat of natural resources - water, soil and atmosphere by point, line and planary sources of pollution and definition of the ecological priorities of landscape - eco-stabilizing function of landscape spatial structure, legislative nature conservation of territory and important natural resources)
   b) Determination of present environmental situation, elaboration of synthetic bases (ecological problems of landscape and ecological significance of landscape)
   c) Determination of territorial assumptions for sustainable development according to present environmental situation.
   Sustainable development of a territory is not possible to understand as development of territory, which is going on at present on a given territory. An appropriate development of a territory is possible to derive from an evaluation of the present environmental situation. In those regions, where natural processes still function well and where appropriate conditions for life are preserved, it is possible to speak about sustainable development.
   The present environmental situation on the territory of Slovakia may be evaluated in 11 categories. This situation creates various starting point assumptions for a sustainable development of the territory. The main outputs are three groups of territorial assumptions for sustainable development of Slovakia:
   I. A very suitable assumption for a sustainable development (territory with undeteriorated environment; present environmental situation: 1. excellent, 2. extraordinary suitable, 3. very suitable; 42 % of territory with 18 % inhabitants)
   II. A less suitable assumption for a sustainable development (territory with starting deteriorated environment; present environmental situation: 4. suitable, 5. above-average, 6. average, 7. below-average; 24 % territory with 22 % inhabitants)
   III. An unsuitable assumption for a sustainable development (territory with a very deteriorated life environment; present environmental situation: 8. unsuitable, 9. very unsuitable, 10. extraordinary unsuitable, 11. extremely unsuitable; 34 % territory with 60 % inhabitants).
   Projection of density and amount of inhabitants to the present environmental situation describe a further reality, that the environment with the worst environmental situation indicates also the highest density of inhabitants.

AB Three basic directions in landscape ecology are mutually united in one uniform system. The static landscape ecology gives the contents for the dynamic one, because the static phenomena compared in time and space can be used for the interpretation of changes and diversity in landscape. The applied landscape ecology is based on knowledge of the static and dynamic landscape ecology. At the present time, the suggestions from applied landscape ecology are transferred and solved in the static and dynamic landscape ecology.
   Landscape-ecological planning is an application of theoretical principles of landscape ecology for solution to practical questions of ecologically optimal and sustainable development of human society on the Earth. An effort in assertment of ecological approach in planning of development of a territory is connected with the beginning of landscape ecology development and at present it is developed in various forms.
   A system approach at landscape-ecological planning is possible to divide to ten steps of whose eight ones represent an elaboration of ecological data about landscape on the level of basic landscape-ecological research. The second part has an applied character. Proposals of ecologically optimal landscape use leads into a content and space model, which gives a base for a process of realization of proposals.

AB Environmental impact assessment represents an effective preventive system against damage to the environment that is based on prognosis and assessment of presumed positive and negative impacts of development projects and policies. Primarily the acts on environmental impact assessment have had great influence on decision making processes in the sphere of environmental, social and economic development on national and global levels.
   The article analyses the contemporary research priorities on the basis of the results of important international conferencies and workshops, numerous of methodological guidelines, textbooks, final reports and studies in the area of environmental impact assessment. The main priorities in basic research are: cumulative effects analysis, decision analysis acid relationships between the strategic environmental assessment and concept of sustainability; in applied research they are: evaluation of the results of the monitoring and post-project analysis, involvement of public in the assessment process and improvement of the effectiveness of the decision-making processes.

AB TSES represents the whole-scale structure of mutually linked ecosystems, their parts and elements, it secures the sustainability of life forms and life conditions in the landscape and creates conditions for the sustainable development of landscape. Inevitable part of TSES is also the system of measures leading to ecologically optimal organization and utilization of the landscape. Methods for TSES elaboration comprise the following steps:
   I. Analyses - concentrated on selection, specification and characterization of chosen abiotic, biotic and socio-economic complex qualities, which determine the creation of TSES.
   II. Syntheses - they represent the supraposition of chosen analyses factors. This results in production of two basic synthesis maps:
   a) map of positive elements of the territory. Here, the space differentiation of ecologically important segments (life forms and life conditions) is depicted.
   b) map of negative elements which depicts the factors endangering the biodiversity on the territory.
   III. Evaluations - the result of them is the assessment of the ecological situation, spatial ecosystems differentiation and the assessment of endargering agree.
   IV. Propositions - their task is to create quality TSES, made of biocentres, biocorridors and interaction elements, buffer zones, etc.

AB The Baltic Sea is turning to be an inland sea of the European Union. Interlinking the energy systems of the Baltic Sea countries and the relevant EU networks should concur With the process of unification of the states. The primary strategic goal is to create a common free energy marker based on regional energy systems around the Baltic Sea - the Baltic Ring. This common energy system must cover both electricity transmission lines and natural gas pipelines. The Baltic Ring project is of major importance for the economic interaction and growth, sustainable development and security of the energy supply of Baltic Sea states.

AB The widespread introduction and adoption of renewable energy technologies remains high on virtually every national development policy agenda; renewable energy systems can assist national energy autonomy, decentralize resource management, promote environmental conservation, and serve as a means to reduce global warming. The track record of efforts to turn this noble ideology into successful technology transfer and dissemination, however, remains very mixed. It is a story of a few successes amid many failures. Here we document and examine the diffusion of small-scale photovoltaic (PV) systems in Kenya. At the same time that integrated energy plans and top-down models championing renewable energy futures are becoming increasingly common, a new power base, divorced from these grand schemes, has begun to emerge. Over the past decade, some 20 000 to 40 000 small PV systems, essentially all privately financed, have been installed in Kenya. Many valuable lessons for renewable energy research can be found here. The Kenyan case richly illustrates the dramatic role that actors on every scale, from grassroots to international, can have in accelerating - or when mismanaged, impeding - technology transfer and the elevation of renewable energy systems from niche applications to a prominent role in household empowerment, and decentralized and sustainable development initiatives.

AB Thanks to the efforts and enthusiasm of research scientists, biological control today enjoys considerable popularity. An increasing number of decision makers have high expectations of biological control as the foundation of LPM, as a viable commercial alternative to chemical pesticides, as the self-perpetuating solution to exotic pest problems and as the restorer of parks and endangered habitats threatened by alien invasive species. All of these expectations require that biological control scientists engage a broader community, including farmers, extensionists, environmentalists, regulators, and the public at large, and that they succeed with them to transfer, scale up and implement biological control at a level far beyond its present use.
   Increased movement of alien pests due to changing patterns of trade, as well as their emerging importance as threats to biodiversity has increased demand for classical biological control. Meeting this demand effectively will require improved understanding of the risks posed by alien pests and introduced agents, as well as better mechanisms to inform and involve governments and scientists in self-regulation and sharing of benefits. A growing portfolio of commercial biological control agents indicates the potential for inundative methods, but the continued emphasis on developing mass-marketed, pesticide-like agents, increasingly with the help of biotechnology, will eventually limit their application in IPM systems unless a broader approach in taken. Finally, opportunities exist for the transfer of methods for natural enemy conservation on a scale far greater than that of the classical or inundative interventions mentioned above, but realizing these opportunities requires a new approach to research and extension, wherein farmers become active research partners and fanners and scientists explore together the complex and very local dynamics of natural enemy complexes. Thus, for all of these areas of biological control, ''making it work in the field'' will require new directions in scientific research and establishing new partnerships in the transfer and implementation of its results.

AB Research has demonstrated the agricultural potential of biological control. For airborne pathogens as well as for soilborne pathogens similar strategies based on different targets in the life cycle of the pathogen can be distinguished, viz. (1) microbial protection of the host against infection, (2) microbial reduction of pathogen sporulation and (3) microbial interference with pathogen survival.
   Some successes and failures with respect to these targets will be discussed and include (1) biocontrol of seedling diseases, root pathogens, and post-harvest diseases (2) biocontrol of powdery mildew and Botrytis cinerea (3) biocontrol of sclerotial pathogens.
   Despite of a lot of research on biological control of plant diseases, the number of products available is limited and their market size is marginal. The market for biological control products is not only determined by agricultural aspects such as the number of diseases controlled by one biocontrol product in different crops but also by economic aspects as cost-effective mass production, easy registration and the availability of competing means of control including fungicides. The future development of low-chemical input sustainable agriculture and organic farming will determine the eventual role of biological control in agriculture.

AB The past decade has been a rapid development in the view that contemporary agricultural practices should meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations. This philosophy has broadened the priorities for research and development in primary production systems. Now there is reduced emphasis on efficiency and productivity, and an increased concern for ecological sustainability.
   This has had an impact on policies relating to biological control technologies and associated policies have been developed to enhance the uptake of biopesticides. At the same time international agreements on climate change, biodiversity and global trading have potential influences on the use of biological control agents and biological technologies.
   In this review some of these trends in public policy are highlighted as well as the likely effect they may have in the adoption, implementation and ongoing development of biological control technologies.

AB The composition of the germinable seed bank was studied in four vegetation states of the Festuca pallescens grasslands in semiarid Patagonia during four years. The aim of this study was to test whether above-ground vegetation states resulting from grazing exclusion or different combinations oi grazing and topography are reflected in different states of the germinable seed bank. The size of the total and dicot germinable seed bank was positively related to the total cover in each stale. Dicots dominated all germinable seed bank states. Carex patagonica increased its cover as well as its germinable seed bank under grazing disturbance. Grazing did not reduce the germinable seed bank of perennial grasses in uplands where the grazing pressure is lower as compared with slopes. In slopes the germinable seed bank of perennial grasses was significantly reduced by grazing. A reduction of the length oi the grazing period in late spring increases the germinable seed bank of perennial grasses both in upland and slope. These results are interpreted in the frame of a model of management techniques where grazing exclusion during late spring and late summer increases the seed bank of the perennial grasses and promotes their establishment in uplands. The artificial addition of seeds of perennial grasses and the manipulation of the soil surface in order to increase ''safe sites'' appear as management alternatives that deserve further evaluation to improve plant reestablishment in slopes.

AB In 1991, a collaborative project to revise the terrestrial component of a national ecological framework was undertaken with a wide range of stakeholders. This spatial framework consists of multiple, nested levels of ecological generalization with linkages to existing federal and provincial scientific databases. The broadest level of generalization is the ecozone. Macroclimate, major vegetation types and subcontinental scale physiographic formations constitute the definitive components of these major ecosystems. Ecozones are subdivided into approximately 200 ecoregions which are based on properties like regional physiography, surficial geology, climate, vegetation, soil, water and fauna. The ecozone and ecoregion levels of the framework have been depicted on a national map coverage at 1:7 500 000 scale. Ecoregions have been subdivided into ecodistricts based primarily on landform, parent material, topography, soils, waterbodies and vegetation at a scale (1:2 000 000) useful for environmental resource management, monitoring and modelling activities. Nested within the ecodistricts are the polygons that make up the Soil Landscapes of Canada series of 1:1 000 000 scale soil maps. The framework is supported by an ARC-INFO GIS at Agriculture Canada. The data model allows linkage to associated databases on climate, land use and socio-economic attributes.

AB This study outlines an original tool for rural policy planning in southern Europe. This new tool is a process-based, scale-dependent, rural policy-making approach, which is designed to address increasing land degradation problems in southern Europe. Seven important processes are identified (land abandonment, devegetation, intensification in agriculture, global climate change, accelerated soil erosion, increasing water demands, urbanisation) and plotted on a space-time diagram, which clearly shows the spatial and temporal scales for which these processes are significant for landscape change in southern Europe. Conclusions are derived concerning, in particular, sustainable (optimal) rural policy-making for southern Europe's problematic land management. An optimal spatial-temporal scale for land management in southern Europe may range spatially from the ''farm'' (0.5 km(2)) to ''sub-provincial'' level (450 km(2)) and temporally from 7 to 30 years. The study delineates methods and results derivable from such a new policy-planning approach and suggests the usefulness of combining this approach with ecological land classification at the landscape level.

AB For the sustainable development of forest land, as recently prescribed by the Canadian Forest Strategy, a land classification project in northern Newfoundland was initiated to support the local forest management activities. The method adopted here is a modification of the Canadian Committee for Ecological Land Classification's (CCELC) system, and it applies various levels of mapping to uniform areas based on geomorphology, soils, vegetation, climate, water, and fauna.
   In this study, all CCELC levels were mapped; resulting maps were digitized and imported into a Geographic Informations System (GIS). The GIS data base contained the following maps: 1) digital terrain model, 2) bedrock geology, 3) surficial geology, 4) forest inventory, and 5) various levels of the ecological land classification, including Vegetation Types at the lowest level. In addition to the mapping, mensurational data were analyzed to provide stand and stock tables for each of the forest types, including growth curves that could be entered into specific forest growth modelling systems to predict wood supply scenarios based upon different management interventions.

AB This paper identifies some scientific impediments to ecosystem management and describes bio-physical databases required to help systematically and empirically address the ecological sustainability challenge. Examples are drawn from ongoing work in Ontario. This work has implications for efforts in ecological land classification, landscape ecology, more efficient locating of research and monitoring plots, wildlife management and ultimately trade-off analyses. We conclude with the recommendation that the key primary databases, as currently evolving for Ontario, could and should be developed nationally, thereby creating a ''NatGRID database'', i.e., Nationally Georeferenced Resource Information for Decision-making. NatGRID could be used to help address, in a more quantitative manner, fundamental questions regarding ecological sustainability and trade-offs in forest management.

ID HEAVY-METALS; GROWTH
AB The effect of irrigation with secondary treated municipal effluent on the accumulation of heavy metals (Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn) was investigated by monitoring sites that had been irrigated with effluent for 4 and 17 years. At Wodonga, seven tree species were sprinkler irrigated with effluent at an average application rate of 1347 mm per annum from 1980 to 1984. The other site at Canberra was a large grass playing field (9 ha), half of which had been effluent irrigated since 1977. The non-effluent irrigated area served as the control area and provided reference 'background' concentrations to assess the extent of contamination due to 17 years of effluent irrigation. Archived soil samples collected before the commencement of effluent irrigation were compared with those taken in 1984 at Wodonga to assess the extent of contamination. The concentration of labile metals was determined by extraction with EDTA because this method provides a quantitative measure of bioavailable metals. Irrigation with effluent did not increase the EDTA-extractable metals concentration at either site. Furthermore, the EDTA-extractable metal values were within the natural 'background' range reported for Australian soils. These data suggest that it may take between 50 and 100 years for heavy metal levels (mainly Cd) in effluent-irrigated soil to reach the currently proposed threshold values for environmental concern. The potentially harmful effects of long-term accumulation of heavy metals on plant growth cannot be ignored and could affect the sustainability of land-based disposal of effluent.

AB Cities are the most complex forms of settlements which man has built in the course of his cultural development. Their ''metabolism'' is connected with the world economy and is run mainly by fossil energy carriers. Up to now there are no validated models for the evaluation of a sustainable development of urban regions.
   The guidelines for a ''sustainable development'' suggest the reduction of resource consumption. The article is concerned with the problem of how the ''sustainable-development concept'' can be transformed from a global to a regional scale. In urban settlements the strategy of final storage should be applied. By this, the subsystem waste management can be transformed within 10 to 15 years to a ''sustainable status''.
   With regard to the system ''agronomy'', the article concludes that agriculture in urban systems should focus on food production instead of promoting reduction of food production in favour of energy plants, which is not a suitable strategy.
   The main problems are the energy carriers. Transformation to a ''sustainable status'' is only possible by a reconstruction of the urban system, i.e. of buildings and the transportation network. The rate determining step in achieving such a status is the change in the fabric of buildings and in the type of transportation networks. The reconstruction of an urban system needs, mainly for economical reasons, a time period of two generations.

AB A multimedia approach is presented to evaluate the atmospheric impact on Alpine forests in Switzerland. The aim of this approach is the determination of anthropogenic air pollutants leading to wet and dry depositions in an area along the Sankt Gotthard transect crossing the Alps in the North-South direction and to evaluate the possible changes in the soil chemistry. This approach takes into account the historical development of the emissions in order to calculate the depositions back to the beginning of this century and is spatially resolving to realise the mapping of critical levels and loads. The deposition model is supplemented with a soil model in order to calculate the future development of the forest soil. It is shown that a sustainable development of the Alpine ecosystems under consideration is only possible on condition of a 60% reduction of nitrogen and sulphur deposition.

AB The ways in which people use land tends to follow economic motivations. Environmental considerations are often ignored until resource degradation reaches the stage of economic significance. Environmental side-effects of land-use activities are not confined to the area where they apply. In the case of agricultural land use, the way in which farmers use their land may impact on the profitability of neighbouring properties, other properties in the region, and the welfare of the wider community. The question arises as to which land-use practices would be financially viable for the farms as well as ensure environmental sustainability of agricultural land use. This paper outlines the framework of SMAC, a modelling tool that is being developed to analyse the economic and environmental sustainability of land use in catchments. It uses a spatial optimisation approach in a dynamic context. The methodology is applied to the Liverpool Plains catchment in northern New South Wales, Australia. Here, rising saline groundwater tables cause extensive soil salinisation. The underlying hydrological imbalance has been triggered by European-style land-use practices. The conceptual approach of the model combines farm behaviour and catchment response as two process levels. It seeks to provide assistance in developing a land-use strategy for sustainable agriculture in the catchment and provides a tool for assessing the implications of policy changes to enhance the process.

The paper argues that because breeding is mostly conducted in presence of high inputs, it has systematically missed the opportunity to exploit genetic differences at low levels of inputs. Many studies show that these differences do exist, particularly in the case of fertilizers, and that these differences can only be identified is selection is conducted under the target level of inputs. Although this was predicted by theory more than 40 years ago, and has been supported by a large body of experimental data, very few breeders select in sub-optimal or stress conditions. The most common justification is the high environmental variation, and hence the lower heritability expected in low input conditions. While this is not supported by experimental evidence, the paper shows that in the case of a typical crop grown in low-input and climatically marginal conditions such as barley, genetic gains are possible by using locally adapted germplasm and by selecting in the target environment. Similar conclusions, in relation to the use of a low-input selection environment, have been reached recently in maize. It is concluded that the best avenue to a sustainable increase of agricultural production in low-input agricultural systems is through locally based breeding programs.

AB A crop's ability to productively exploit its environment depends on many adaptive features which are controlled by multiple genes, interacting among themselves and with the environment in complex ways.
   To promote widespread adoption, breeders frequently seek to develop broad adaptation in their varieties, often through the use of genes having a large effect on a single adaptive feature. Such genes may occur within the crop, its wild relatives, or unrelated taxa. Genes for many adaptive features (e.g. temperature tolerance) may be found in extreme environments. Others (e.g. photoperiod insensitivity) may have evolved away from primary centres of origin.
   Well characterized and documented ex situ germplasm collections aim to serve plant breeders' need for genes. Molecular marker and geographic information system (GIS) techniques are proving useful for locating and characterizing genetic diversity. New techniques (e.g. core collections and electronic information systems) are adding to the value of collections. Ex situ and in situ conservation of wild crop relatives are receiving increased attention. With all organisms becoming a potential source of genes for breeding, in situ ecosystem conservation is assuming added significance.
   Farmers, particularly in diverse, marginal environments in developing countries, continue to breed landraces adapted to their specific circumstances. In areas of high ecological diversity, a multitude of adaptive gene complexes have been selected within small geographic areas. Conventional breeding frequently neglects such farmers, and participatory methods based on locally adapted diversity, coupled with appropriate technical and policy support, may prove more effective in meeting their needs. Such dynamic, on-farm conservation and management systems would also enable genetic diversity to continue to evolve as a resource for conventional breeding.
   For genetic resources to remain a foundation for future sustainable agricultural development, complementary conservation and breeding strategies are needed.

AB We study a representative agent, open economy in which government-provided services that enter the domestic production function must be financed with distortionary taxes, and focus on the optimal size of government and the associated optimal tax rate. If the government can precommit its actions, it maximizes individual welfare by announcing and implementing a constant tax rate, which we refer to as the 'first-best' tax rate. This tax rate is time inconsistent, and under discretion the government implements a tax that maximizes each period's output - which may be higher or lower than the first-best rate, depending on whether the elasticity of substitution in production between private and public inputs is below or above one. In this paper we characterize the best sequence of tax rates that can be sustained through trigger strategies. This best sustainable sequence of tax rates is constant, and lies between the first-best and discretionary extremes.

AB There is much current interest in the potential role of agroforestry in the mitigation of nutrient depletion in Sub-Saharan Africa. Using data from farm surveys and trials, a static model of N and P flows was constructed for a standard farm system, representative of typical subsistence farms in humid parts of the East African Highlands. The model was used to explore the possible impact of improved agroforestry systems on nutrient budgets, to identify priorities for research.
   Soil nutrient balances in the standard farm system were -107 kg N and -8 kg P ha(-1) yr(-1). Agroforestry systems did not significantly reduce the N deficits except when a high proportion of the total biomass was returned to the soil, rather than removed from the farm. Agroforestry increased N input through biological N fixation and deep N uptake, but this was offset by a larger nutrient removal from the farm in harvested products, which increased from 38 kg N in the standard system to 169 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) in an intensive dairy-agroforestry system. Agroforestry did not increase P inputs, and harvested P increased from 6 kg P in the standard farm system to 29 kg P ha(-1) yr(-1) in the dairy-agroforestry system. Thus, moderate P inputs, of 20 kg P ha(-1) yr(-1) were required to maintain soil P stocks.
   N leaching from the field was the most significant nutrient loss from the farm system, with a range of 68 to 139 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1). The capture of subsoil N by deep-rooted trees in agroforestry systems substantially increased N-use efficiency, providing 60 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) in the dairy-agroforestry system. The budgets were sensitive to N mineralization rates in subsoils, N losses from soils and manures, and effectiveness of deep-rooted plants in subsoil N capture, for which there is little data from the region. Therefore, high priority should be given to research in these areas.
   The current model can not account for important feedback mechanisms that would allow analysis of the long-term effects of nutrient budgets on nutrient availability and plant productivity. Dynamic models of farm nutrient budgets that include such interactions are needed to further assess the sustainability of farming systems.

AB The concretionary soils of Northern Ghana, which are near neutral with respect to pH and which comprise mostly lateritic ferruginous nodules are known to sorb significant amounts of phosphate. Instead of imported superphosphate, the use of less expensive indigenous Togo rock phosphate (PR) or partially acidulated (50%) Togo rock phosphate (PAPR-50), are possible alternative phosphate fertilizer options for these soils. The objective of this research was to evaluate the effectiveness of freshly-applied SSP, PR and PAPR-50, and the effectiveness of the residues of these fertilizers in a glasshouse pot study. Laboratory studies were also undertaken to study the transformation of these fertilizers after their application to the concretionary ferruginous soils. In the greenhouse study, yield of dried tops and the P uptake by the tops of maize var. Dobidi (Zea mays) was used to measure fertilizer effectiveness. One level of P was applied for each fertilizer (26.4 kg P ha(-1)). Plants were grown for 28 days. After harvesting the first crop, subsequent cropping was carried out to evaluate the effects of the residual P in the pots. The results showed that increases in dry matter yield of shoot and total P uptake followed the trend SSP > PAPR-50 > PR > control. The relative agronomic effciency (RAE) of PAPR-50 was 58% that of commercial SSP in increasing growth of the crop, while that of PR was only 23%. The residual effect of either PAPR-50 or PR on dry matter yield and total P uptake was found to be negligible compared with SSP, suggesting that apatitic P was poorly effective relative to SSP in the used soils. The P fractionation results confirmed that PR and PAPR-50 did not significantly increase any of the P fractions in either the soil fines or nodules after the first crop. By contrast, application of SSP increased all extractable Pi fractions, most of the P added being recovered from the nodules in forms associated with Fe (hydroxide and residual Pi). It is concluded that, relative to SSP, the P from residues of PAPR-50 and PR are poorly effective in the soils studied for sustainable plant production.

AB Nitrogen use per unit area in Egyptian agriculture is over 300 kg ha(-1). An annual average increase of about 2% till year 2000 was estimated. Fertilizers use is characterised by excessive N application, moderate P use and neglection of K and micronutrients. Consequently, nutrient imbalance occurs in crop plants. Subsidising N fertilizers resulted in their misuse and increasing losses. Efficiency of N use in different areas and crops is low. High nitrate concentrations were detected in drainage as well as ground water. Subsidy was removed and fertilizers handling was left to the free market in 1992/93, which resulted in drastic price increases. It could be demonstrated for many years and in farmers fields that yields can be considerably increased (20%) through balanced fertilizers use based on soil testing and plant analysis and adjusted according to the prevailing farming system, leading to more return and less N-use. Use of micronutrients foliar fertilizers leads to increase in root growth and higher uptake of macronutrients. Use of relatively high rates of fertilizers is still a must, however it should be optimised to obtain the highest possible efficiency. Making crop and location specific fertilizer recommendations available to farmers helps in increasing high quality yields, which results in high economic benefits, keeping agricultural production sustainable and decreasing pollution.

AB Nutrient management is the key issue in sustainable soil fertility. N, P, K fertilization aims not only for a high economic return of the investment through optimized yield and quality, but also for minimum environmental hazards. The basic concept underlying integrated plant nutrition systems, is the maintenance and possible increase of soil fertility for sustaining enhanced crop productivity through optimal use of all sources of plant nutrients, particularly inorganic fertilizer, in an integrated manner and as appropriate to each specific ecological, social and economic situation. Much research has established the importance of fertilizers in increasing the fertility of soil and in influencing its productivity. It has been observed that applying fertilizers causes many changes in the soil, including chemical changes, that can positively or negatively influence its productiveness. Only a fraction of the fertilizer applied to the soil is taken up by the crop, the rest either remains in the soil or is lost through leaching, physical wash-off, fixation by the soil, or release to the atmosphere through chemical and microbiological processes. The critical information on the relative merits of different fertilization practices such as method of fertilizer placement, time and late of application and type of fertilizers, is essential. Results from different field and laboratory experiments which helped to achieve maximum efficiency, in the most economical and sustainable way of fertilizer use to reduce the nutrient losses and production costs to the farmers and prevent environmental pollution are presented in the paper.

DE agricultural practices; codes
AB In most European countries, agriculture's responsibility as regards environmental quality, in particular that of water, is widely accepted, as also is its determining role in maintaining the countryside. The conservation of water quality seems to be, for each country, a national issue, but it is also international. All the categories of water are concerned; drinking water (surface or underground), with problems as regards nitrate content and pesticide residues, but also bathing water, with specific microbiological problems, and surface waters with the risk of eutrophication.
   The discharge into coastal waters of rivers and streams containing undesirable elements extends to the marine environment the concern to limit risks related to agriculture.
   In France, a Committee comprising members from diffennt sectors for the control of water pollution resulting from agricultural activities (CORPEN) has been working on the nitrate problem since the beginning of the 1980s. More recently it has been concerned also with pesticides. The avoidance of point pollution (from agro-industry, industrial farms) evidently requires a regulatory approach, whereas diffuse pollution requires a careful study of 'agricultural practices', in order to recommend those which seem to present the least risk in terms of nitrate emissions.
   The recommendations cover the following points;
   fertilization must be in accordance with the crop needs in order to avoid excessive applications, taking account of supplies from organic sources (manure, slurry),
   soil must not be lett bare during rainy periods,
   the presence of nitrates in the soil during periods between crops must be limited (through the management of crop residues, planting of 'trap' crops),
   the countryside must be maintained.
   These points are common to all the recommendations, and especially to the codes of good agricultural practice drafted in application of the European Directive.
   In order to be effective, it is essential that the recommendations should be widely known and accepted. This requires each farmer to receive a clear and consistent message
   adapted to local conditions (climate, soil, crops)
   with an identical content, whatever the origin of the recommendation.
   It is along these lines that a series of advisory operations is at present being developed in France in well defined zones, where appropriate advice is given (particularly as regards fertilization) and adopted by all the advisors in the region. This is the 'Fertimieux' operation, which calls upon the voluntary co-operation of farmers. In addition, in applying the nitrate directive, action programmes will be developed for each of the vulnerable zones. These good practice recommendations will then be obligatory. In taking account of the pesticide risks, attention must be paid to the consistency of the 'nitrate' and 'pesticide' recommendations.
   Adaptation to the practices of farmers requires a substantial effort in the definition of recommendations and in making them known. All the partners (public authorities, farmers, industry and distributors) must coordinate their efforts. But this is the price for reconciling agricultural activity with maintenance of our way of life, i.e. for ensuring a sustainable agriculture.

TI Outline of an applied ethics for sustainable development - Commentary
SO FILOSOFICKY CASOPIS

DT Article
AB Our age has been described as the civilization of means without ends. Thinkers as different as Weber, Foucault and Habermas have pointed out that instrumental rationality has increasingly dominated value rationality (Wertrationalitat) for more than two centuries. In the paper it is argued that this development has undermined our ability to skillfully pose, answer and act upon simple ethical questions like: ''Where are we going? Who's gaining, who's losing? Is it desirable? What should be done? More than two thousand years ago Aristotle was keenly aware that the inability to pose and answer questions like these could seriously impair the social and physical existence of individuals, communities, and societies alike. Yet, toward the end of the Twentieth Century it seems that we have more of a need and less of a capacity to act value rationally than in earlier periods of human history. Through a current interpretation of the Aristotelian concepts episteme, techne and phronesis, first described in the Nicomachean Ethics, the modem concept of rationality is reformulated and enlarged and a method for value rational analysis called ''progressive phronesis'' outlined. The work of Michel Foucault is read as a paradigmatic case of progressive phronesis. The reading of Foucault is supplemented by readings of Robert Bellah, Clifford Geertz, Richard Rorty, Hubert Dreyfus and others in order to extract common methodological features of progressive phronesis. Finally the paper suggests a specific role for ethical analysis in environmental policy and in what the United Nations' World Commission on Environment and Development has called ''sustainable development''.

AB This is a comparative study on plant performance and population characteristics among populations of Orchis simia (Orchidaceae) in both the south-eastern and north-western limits of its distribution area, viz. on Cyprus and in northern France and the southern part of the Netherlands.
   Differences in leaf area of the flowering plants between the areas is important for population fitness: a smaller leaf area may shorten the juvenile life stage. Morphological differences between rosette leaves from both regions can be considered as adaptations to the specific structures of the local vegetation. In the south-eastern population relatively more phytomass is allocated to the reproductive organs compared to the north-western populations.
   Since many species of high conservational value in north-western Europe originate from the Mediterranean area, results of comparative studies like the present one, will enable conservationists to develop appropriate measures for sustainable species preservation in the former region.

AB Aphandra natalia (Balslev&Henderson) Barfod is native to the western Amazon. It is exploited commercially for its leaf sheath and petiole fibers, which are used for brooms. Data from a 2 year study on production and harvest of fibers in the province of Morona-Santiago in Ecuador shows correlations to exist between the degree of the palm's exposure to light and leaf production, and between exposure to light and petiole length (maximum fiber length), while correlation is absent between exposure to light and fiber load per leaf. A linear relation was found between time and leaf production, with an overall average of 5.5 leaves produced per palm per year. No difference in leaf production of male and female palms was found among palms growing at low light intensities, while among palms in open, light-exposed areas, males were found to produce significantly more leaves than females. An average of 8.5 leaves are cut per palm per harvest, yielding 3.4 kg of fibers, while 6.9 leaves are left untouched. Average harvest time per palm is 33 min. Under optimal conditions (high densities of easy accessible palms), one harvester may harvest and clean about 20 kg of fibers in 1 day, selling at US$1.1 kg(-1). One hectare with high, but natural, densities of the palm may produce fibers worth US$460 per year, which can be harvested and prepared in 22 work days. Exploitation of the edible fruits may be combined with fiber extraction if female palms are left to produce fruits, while male palms are exploited for fibers, or if harvest frequency of fibers from female palms is lowered considerably below the average of once every 1.55 years. The exploitation practised in the study area appears sustainable.

TI Palmito sustainability and economics in Brazil's Atlantic coastal forest
SO FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE palm; forest management; non-timber forest product; economic model
AB A number of palm species produce edible palm hearts, or 'palmito' as it is called in Brazil. Palmito jussara (Euterpe edulis) is a favorite for both international export and Brazilian consumption. Except on private lands, extraction of wild jussara palmito (or just 'palmito') from Brazil's Atlantic Coastal Forest is illegal. Yet palmito extraction in this forest continues on a large scale because of profitability for palmito processors and merchants, ineffective government intervention, and relatively attractive earnings for low-income palmito harvesters ('palmiteiros').
   Because most palmito cutting and transport is clandestine, virtually no information is available on the financial returns from palmito extraction. However, the question is central for discussions of sustainability in unmanaged vs. managed agro-ecological systems. While reliable data are impossible to obtain, we interviewed several individuals in Brazil in order to formulate scenarios of palmito production, prices, and costs. We simulate the uncertainties in assumptions and data to generate a range of estimates on the net value of palmito management alternatives.
   Financial net present value (NPV) of palmito extraction is highly sensitive to the time value of money (discount rate). 'Managed' extraction is more attractive than unmanaged extraction at low discount rates. As the discount rate increases, the attractiveness of sustainable palmito management decreases. All scenarios suggest that palmito cutting is very lucrative, explaining current institutional problems in controlling its commerce.

AB The ranges and ancient origins down through the Pleistocene of the species which make up the Boreal Forest formation are discussed. Jack and lodgepole pine, white and black spruce are essentially modern; others are older. Genetic variation of the five major boreal species groups - poplars, birches, pines, spruces and tamarack - is outlined. A discussion of natural hybrids and introgression follows with examples of types of species pairs, and artificial hybridization in poplars, and white and black spruce. Specialized life strategies of species for growing in the boreal zone and how silvicultural systems may be related to them are explained. Understanding genetic diversity and its importance in management applications is critical for the maintenance of well-adapted populations. Failure to do so results in erosion or even total loss of gene pools. Historical examples and current practices in the northeast and certain areas of the boreal forest indicate that losses in genetic diversity, reduced biodiversity, commercial and even local extinction may be widespread. It is hoped that development and application of as yet proximal forest genetic management principles will enable the maintenance of the forests' genetic structures and gene pools, critical for the true sustainablity of forest ecosystems.

ID FIRE; HISTORY
AB Canada recently embarked on a model forest program that is guided by the notion of sustainable development. Ten model forest sites have been established at operational scales (0.1 - 1.5 million ha) in different ecoregions since 1992. This study presents a framework for advancing both the human welfare and environmental dimensions of sustainable forest use by a localized multi-stake-holdership of First Nations, government and industry in the boreal Prince Albert Model Forest, Saskatchewan. The pressure on the local forest environment has been rising due to timber harvest and tourism. Human welfare has been influenced strongly by colonial legacies such as racial divisions, territorial boundaries, and centralized forest administration, The landbase, productivity and forest value approaches are proposed to advance sustainable forest use; but current data availability favours the landbase approach. Analysis of forest inventory data suggests that management needs to plan for a significant aggregation of harvest areas to sustain ecological and cultural functions which depend on large and continuous patch size. Forest policy-making must address ownership issues, local economic development, and economic philosophies of the stakeholders in order to overcome the colonial legacies and to redefine management responsibilities. The study proposes that the currently dominating government-owned management concepts should evolve into a more localized concept of ownership and management that can be sustainably supported and financed by forest stakeholders, governments, and local communities.

TI Flood-hazard response in Argentina
SO GEOGRAPHICAL REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
DE climate change; government corruption; hazard-response models;
   interest-group politics; political systems
AB The frequency of major floods in Argentina appears to be increasing rapidly. At the same time, human vulnerability to flood hazard is gradually rising because of economically induced population movement. The World Bank is assisting the Argentine government in promoting more sustainable flood-alleviation strategies, based on the control of land use in floodplain areas. But many circumstances make the implementation of such an approach highly problematic. The case study demonstrates the value of broad-scale models that emphasize the context of hazard-response decisions as a complex mixture of physical, demographic, political, and economic variables.

TI Divisions of labour, institutional distance and place dependence: The
   restructuring of industrial Mittelstand firms in the Ruhr area
SO GEOGRAPHISCHE ZEITSCHRIFT
LA German
DT Article
AB During the last few years representatives of both large corporations and Mittelstand firms have begun to question the sustainability of the German Model in the wake of increasing international economic integration. The paper seeks to examine this,globalisation rhetoric' by analysing restructuring strategies of Mittelstand firms in the Ruhr Area. In the first section a different view on the geography of business restructuring and the role of place therein is developed, integrating political-economic and socio-organisational approaches to spatial change. It is argued that analysis should start from the space relevant for the business enterprise and the conflicts arising as firms move up and down the spatial scale hierarchy. The second section seeks to illustrate this framework by presenting empirical case-studies. There is a considerable contrast between the strategies followed and the rhetoric employed by Mittelstand representatives. Sample firms had problems in expanding organisational control to the supra-national level and in adapting to a changing and expanding division of labour. Institutional distance, place dependence and the lack of organisational capacity play a major role in explaining these difficulties. All in all, the business strategies display a complex and conflictual juxtaposition of co-operative and competitive elements, and are far more complex than they seem to be in a neoliberal discourse of globalisation.

AB Strong environmental awareness, and a commitment to environmental management and control, is a legacy in contemporary Zimbabwe from pre-independence days. Widely recognized today as crucial for both local and global sustainable development, such commitment, however, is not without criticism, much of which is illustrated by an analysis of the contemporary implementation of environmental policy to control the cultivation of public land in Harare. The need to streamline environmental policy and its infrastructural support is illustrated, and a more balanced policy approach, fed by further research, is called for, that is more accommodative to social, economic and environmental implications, for stable development to be achieved.

ID MORTGAGE DEFAULT
AB Homeownership counseling encompasses several educational activities. Early approaches focused on reducing the risk of default and foreclosure among participants in government-assisted mortgage programs, but more recent approaches have focused on increasing homeownership opportunities among low-income and minority households. Unfortunately, little is known about the effectiveness of these approaches in terms of the number of new homeowners and the mitigation of default risk. To address that gap, this article presents a theoretical and methodological framework to evaluate counseling efforts.
   A successful counseling program is defined as one that assists a household with a low long-term probability of ownership in buying a home and reducing its default risk. We concede that the methodological requirements for evaluating counseling are somewhat restrictive. However, if we establish an evaluation procedure using these goals as a framework, we can more accurately determine the effects of counseling on the sustainability of low-income homeownership.

DE public housing; policy; revitalization
AB This article provides a practitioner's view of proposals and efforts to revitalize the most distressed housing communities under the Urban Revitalization Demonstration (URD) program. While data suggest that most public housing is in good physical condition, recent trends toward increasingly impoverished resident populations suggest that tinkering with the public housing program by changing occupancy policies or creating new, small-scale initiatives will not lead to long-term sustainability of communities.
   The article reviews recent public housing history and the efforts of the National Commission on Severely Distressed Public Housing to assess the root causes of distress and identify solutions. URD plans in Seattle and Indianapolis are used to illustrate the range of flexible intervention strategies for revitalizing public housing communities. Since little research exists to indicate which combination of approaches ensures the long-term sustainability of revitalized communities or mixed-income developments, more evaluation of URD efforts is necessary.

AB A common exhortation by conservationists suggests that we can solve ecological problems by returning to the attitudes of traditional societies: reverence for resources, and willingness to assume short-term individual costs for long-term, group-beneficial sustainable management. This paper uses the 186-society Standard Cross-Cultural Sample to examine resource attitudes and practices. Two main findings emerge: (1) resource practices are ecologically driven and do not appear to correlate with attitude (including sacred prohibition) and (2) the low ecological impact of many traditional societies results not from conscious conservation efforts, but from various combinations of low population density, inefficient extraction technology, and lack of profitable markets for extracted resources.

DE GCRA; shaper; enforcer; time difference
AB In ITU-T Recommendation 1.371, the Generic Cell Rare Algorithm (GCRA) is used to define Peak Cell Rate for the ATM network. It is further applied by the TM Forum '93 to define Sustainable Cell Rate and Burst Tolerance so as to facilitate Usage Parameter Control and Network Parameter Control. To judge the validity of a cell according to declared GCRA parameters, the enforcer must read the clock time when the cell arrives. However, the clock of the enforcer would roll over frequently and accordingly the judgment would be incorrect. On the other hand, for a shaper in a customer premise node to dispatch cells conforming to the declared GCRA parameters, the clock would also roll over and the cell would not be dispatched correctly To overcome the problems induced by clock roll-over, based on ''time difference'' concept, we propose two modified GCRA's for the enforcer and shaper, respectively. According to the proposed algorithms, we design a feasible architecture for a multi-connection shaper and simplify it for an enforcer. They are proven to perform well in spite of the inherent clock roll-over characteristics. By simulation, we evaluate the delay in the shaper and the loss in the enforcer. The features of the architectures are also discussed.

AB Habituation is one of the four neoplastic diseases of plants and occurs spontaneously in plant cell cultures. To date, and even if an epigenetic origin has been previously postulated, the fundamental concept that underlies this neoplastic state remains obscure. Recently, a permanent stress hypothesis has been proposed, using habituated nonorganogenic (HNO) sugarbeet cell line (Bera vulgaris L. altissima) as a model. According to this proposal, the low catalase and peroxidase activities were supposed to be responsible for H2O2 accumulation. A supposed lipoxygenase activation would generate LOO degrees radicals. OH degrees, produced by the Fenton reaction would he responsible for a lipoperoxidation process, leading to malondialdehyde (MDA) accumulation. In this paper, the elements of this hypothesis have been examined using data previously obtained by several teams, and the permanent stress idea appears less sustainable. Several properties of the habituated nonorganogenic sugarbeet- and some other habituated-cell lines have been described. A more realistic concept emerging from this analysis is that habituated cells exhibit efficient scavenging properties (antioxidant and antilipoperoxidant) against deleterious free radicals produced during cell culture. This thesis is developed in this article.

AB Based on the appropriateness of information technology (IT) for technoeconomic development in the Third World, the establishment of a reliable and effective framework for each country is a complex and crucial task. Approaching this task necessitates the implementation of two major stages: to understand the fundamental elements and characteristics of information technology along with local related constraints; and to address the fundamental bases on which a given country can constitute its own policy making and planning system of national IT transfer and development. Despite the first stage, the second stage has not been given adequate attention in the literature. Therefore, in this paper an attempt is made to improve and implement the second stage within a conceptual model.
   According to the mechanisms and conceptual discussions that are analysed in this paper and to those addressed in the literature (in [12] in particular), this paper will consider a set of five major components required for the establishment of a sustainable IT transfer framework.

DE biomass; industrial combustion; nitrogen oxides; thermal efficiency;
   developing countries; process industries
AB Solid biomass materials are an important industrial fuel in many developing countries and also show good potential for usage in Europe within a future mix of renewable energy resources. The sustainable use of wood fuels for combustion relies on operation of plant with acceptable thermal efficiency. There is a clear link between plant efficiency and environmental impacts due to air pollution and deforestation. To supplement a somewhat sparse literature on thermal efficiencies and nitrogen oxide emissions from biomass-fuelled plants in developing countries, this paper presents results for tests carried out on 14 combustion units obtained during field trials in Sri Lanka. The plants tested comprised steam boilers and process air heaters. Biomass fuels included: rubber-wood, fuelwood from natural forests; coconut shells; rice husks; and sugar cane bagasse. Average NOx (NO and NO2) emissions for the plants were found to be 47 gNO(2) GJ(-1) with 18% conversion of fuel nitrogen. The former value is the range of NOx emission values quoted for combustion of coal in grate-fired systems; some oil-fired systems and systems operating on natural gas, but is less than the emission levels for the combustion of pulverized fuel and heavy fuel oil. This value is significantly within current European standards for NOx emission from large combustion plants. Average thermal efficiency of the plants was found to be 50%. Observations made on operational practices demonstrated that there is considerable scope for the improvement of this thermal efficiency value by plant supervisor training, drying of fuelwood and the use of simple instruments for monitoring plant performance.

AB Environmental management and sustainable development are at the top of the global agenda. In conjunction with the principles of equity and ethics, the implementation of sustainable development has become one of the most important challenges before the world community. Technology lies at the heart of this concern. Industry, in turn, is the largest user and producer of technology, and it produces materials that pollute the environment. The sustainability criteria of technology would entail a change not only in the nature of technology but also in its usage. There are technologies referred to as 'clean', but the deployment of such technologies is not easy. Because technological change is part of social process, society itself must undergo a large-scale re-engineering and evolve clean production systems to ensure the sustainability of sustainable technologies.

AB The complex interactions and the increasing extent of human activities motivate safety planners to switch the focus from the source-oriented safety management approach to regional sustainable development. Traditional safety management is oriented toward technological systems, whereas sustainable management is approached from a regional perspective. Consequently, safety issues in sustainable management can be addressed in the context of regional safety management at three levels: macro (policy level), meso (organizational level), and micro (operational level). The management process, at all three levels, can be divided into two phases: analysis and decision-making. In addition to this switch in paradigm, advanced information and communications technologies have a major impact on management practice, at all three levels, both for analysis and decision-making. The purpose of this paper is to address the potential impact of new information and communications technologies on regional safety management, and the necessary ramifications for organizations and institutions to benefit in an optimal way from these imminent changes. The paper ends with a research agenda referring to development issues and implementations at the macro, meso, and micro level.

AB Non-governmental organizations, or NGOs, are increasingly instrumental to the implementation of international health programs. Following an overview of current conditions in global health and the problems that could be targeted by NGOs, this article describes the activities and philosophies of several representative approaches in this sector. The attributes of NGOs that increase their potential effectiveness are discussed, including ability to reach areas of severe need, promotion of local involvement, low cost of operations, adaptiveness and innovation, independence, and sustainability. A summary is provided of major future challenges in international health that may be addressed by NGOs, with particular emphasis on tobacco-related disease, communicable diseases and the AIDS epidemic, maternal mortality and women's health, injury prevention and control, and the need to secure durable financial support.

AB In developing countries, agriculture is being intensified to produce more food and agricultural products. In most agricultural development strategies, the order of priorities is on: (i) increasing yields, (ii) crop protection, and (iii) human health, environmental and social aspects. This sequential rather than integrated approach contributes to many problems related to sustainability in agriculture. Examples of increased problems with soil erosion, secondary salinization and waterlogging, soil nutrient depletion, increased pest problems, public health hazards and environmental pollution illustrate this phenomenon. To improve the present situation, agricultural development strategies should be based on an integration of factors determining the agricultural production potential of a particular zone: the biophysical environment, the land reclamation level, and external input use. Integrated Crop Management and systems analyses can help to put these factors in the best perspective, and to set the priorities for agricultural research and development accordingly. Techniques aimed at sustainability are listed, and their use is discussed in areas with different production potentials. To assess the impact of cropping techniques on the sustainability of agricultural production systems, suggestions are made for the monitoring of selected physical, chemical and biotic characteristics of agro-ecosystems.

AB Community-based intervention techniques inspired by Freirian educational philosophy can be adopted by social workers to address deep-seated problems of poverty and underdevelopment in different parts of the world, thus helping to transcend the profession's narrow remedial focus. A case study from Brazil's western Amazonia illustrates how NGO activists have performed innovative roles in the areas of collective self-defence, education and alliance-building, thus assisting previously threatened and vulnerable riverine fishing communities to enhance their standards of living and sustain local livelihoods while conserving common natural resources.

Argues that global information should promote human development in areas such as education, health, social services and commercial activity. The Conference of African Ministers recently declared support for the building of Africa's information highway, recognizing the need for African countries to develop information networks for full Internet connectivity, enabling access to the same information systems for Africa's economic recovery and sustainable development.

AB Fundamental changes within the steel industry suggest that the current classification of the industry as 'mature', according to the mass of steel produced, is no longer valid. The industry is changing from a commodity business to a manufacturer of a wide variety of fit for purpose products, and, within this definition, the industry is growing. Product and manufacturing technology are changing in support of the business change to eventually provide the flexible manufacturing capabilities that will be required. The structure of the steel research and development (R&D) function needs to change to reflect or anticipate industry changes. Trends in R&D are: development of high value products and automated processes; cooperative developments with consumers and equipment suppliers; and an emphasis on the sustainability of the industry within environmental constraints.

AB This study comprises the stress and stiffness analyses of a second type of modified double containment corner joint which is presented as an alternative to two previous designs in order to reduce the effect of bending moment on the adhesive stresses. Plates are bonded at a right angle into slots of a corner support and the vertical slot depth is kept as large as possible in order to produce a joint which is stiffer and sustainable to high loads, provided that high stress concentration regions are under compression, and to obtain savings of the corner joint volume. The analyses were carried out using the finite element method and assuming that the adhesive, plates, and corner support had linear-elastic properties. Since the geometry of the adhesive free end has an important effect on the high adhesive stresses, the adhesive spew fillet arising from the applied pressure to provide the physical contact between the adhesive and plates was taken into account. In order to show the effect of boundary and loading conditions on the stresses and the overall joint stiffness, the joint was analysed for three loading conditions: two linear and a bending moment. It was found that the loading in the normal direction to the horizontal plate plane at its free end was the most critical and that maximum stress concentrations occurred around the adhesive free ends. A detailed study of adhesive stresses showed that the peak adhesive stresses occurred at the lower free end of the left vertical adhesive layer-slot interface for this loading condition and bending moment, respectively, and at the lower free end of the right vertical adhesive layer-slot interface for the loading condition in another direction. In addition, the effects of geometrical dimensions of the corner support, such as the horizontal and vertical support lengths, slot depth, and support thickness, on the peak adhesive stresses and on the overall joint stiffness were investigated and it was found that whereas the support lengths had a considerable effect, the effect of the slot depth and support thickness was negligible. The dimensions of the corner support were determined relative to the plate thickness based on the results.

AB Much research has supported the conclusion of the report from The Royal College of Surgeons and College of Anaesthetists (1990), London, England, that the relief of postoperative pain is in many cases unsatisfactory and calls for more research on the effectiveness of educational programmes. A prime aim of nursing research is to influence and to improve practice. In relation to postoperative pain Sofaer's (1985) study was an example of the use of a quasiexperimental approach to improve postoperative pain relief through nurse education. Sofaer suggests that although positive effects were demonstrated they may not have been sustained in the long term. Further, Sofaer suggests that action research may have produced a more sustainable change. This paper critically discusses the use of these two research methods in relation to this problem.

AB The article reviews the relevant concepts in assessing sustainability at the sector level for British agriculture and forestry. It notes that the use of reproducible capital is not sustainable in the sector as depreciation has exceeded gross fixed capital formation for some years, although that retrenchment may, however, be an appropriate response to expected lower farm prices and increased efficiency in the use of capital. It then exemplifies the problems of measuring the sustainability of use of natural capital by reference to specific problems, namely the release of global pollutants from agriculture and forestry, the economic cost of soil erosion and the economic cost associated with damage to Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). On the basis of a wider review of the context of these changes, it is concluded that the sustainability of primary land use, as currently practised, must await substantial research before positive claims can be made for its overall sustainability.

AB Prediction equations are developed and evaluated to estimate the maximum sustainable pull and the form of penetration of land anchors. The theories for estimating the pattern of penetration and maximum sustainable anchor force compare well with the measured results in five contrasting soil conditions. The maximum and mean error between the predicted and measured maximum anchor force were 13% and 8%, respectively, representing an over-prediction of force in both cases. The correlation coefficient between the maximum anchor force and the mean values of soil shear strength, obtained using the cone index and shear vane were 0.86 and 0.85 respectively indicating that both the cone penetrometer and shear vane are valuable for in-field prediction of maximum anchor forces in both dry frictional and plastic clay soils.

AB Most writers on resource management presume that local populations, if they act in their self-interest, seldom conserve or prefect natural resources without external intervention or privatization. Using the example of forest management by villagers in the Indian Himalayas, this paper argues that rural populations can often use resources sustainably and successfully, even under assumptions of self-interested rationality. Under a set of specified social and environmental conditions, conditions that prevail in large areas of the Himalayans and may also exist in. other mountain regions, community institutions are more efficient in managing resources than either private individuals or the central government. In advancing this argument, the paper undermines the often dogmatic belief in the universal superiority of private forms of ownership and management.

ID AGRICULTURE
AB This study was undertaken to assess farmers' attitudes toward sustainable agricultures and the environment. The majority of Ontario farmers in this 1991 survey supported the need for government policies which promote sustainable agriculture bur there were major differences in the government policies which farmers thought would be sustainable or desirable. Most farmers felt the Government should promote diversified rural economic development, sponsor appropriate research and provide conservation grants to farmers willing to change to more sensitive environmental methods. Those least interested in forms of government intervention designed to enhance agricultural sustainability operated the largest farms. Conversely, those most likely to be receptive to government regulations and interventions designed to enhance rural equity, stability, productivity and sustainability were the smaller operation farmers who most often had off-farm employment.

DE Bertrand competition; implicit collusion; flexible exchange rates
ID SUPERGAMES
AB This paper explores the potential of firms to restrict industry outputs (market power) in oligopolistically organized markets where domestic firms compete with foreign ones. Within a stochastic price-setting supergame framework, market power is shown to be lower in general with flexible exchange rates for the following reasons. (i) The conditions that the fully collusive outcome - oligopolists maximizing joint profits - is sustainable in equilibrium become stronger if the exchange rate fluctuates,provided that fluctuations are sufficiently small. (ii) Even if full collusion can be sustained, industry outputs will be higher on the average with flexible than with fixed exchange rates.

ID MULTIPLE-USE FORESTRY; DEFORESTATION
AB This paper presents a stylized spatial-intertemporal model for the economic management of tropical forests, a model that reflects ecological constraints, especially spatial interactions across plots and the irreversibility of some uses. The explicit recognition of the varied uses of forested land, spatial interdependence, irreversibility, and uncertainty leads to optimal patterns that have different structures and, in general, more forested area than those recommended by traditional models. Two ''flexible'' land uses and one spatial interaction term contribute to the quasi-option value. The spatial-intertemporal framework permits examination of important issues such as sustainability, forest fragmentation, and land recovery dynamics. (C) 1996 Academic Press, Inc.

AB The multitude of environmental problems in a world of dynamic and unpredictable natural systems call for new methods that make use of recent development in the digital integration of human reasoning, data and dynamic models. A reported course in Natural Resources Management is based on holistic perception, systems dynamics and cybernetics, and uses geo-informatics as vehicles in projects on eutrophication, acidification, ecological settlings, and Landsat-TM multispectral classification. The projects are efficient, but time consuming, tools for teaching environmental management. Student differences in cognisance are great, and most had problems coupling different models and data, theory and problem solving. Improved multimedia interfaces could be a temporary solution.

AB High concentrations of native extractable boron (B) and selenium (Se) found in some soil environments are detrimental to sustainable agriculture in many parts of the western U.S. As part of a strategy to reduce the impact of this problem, greenhouse and field experiments were conducted to study B and Se uptake in the following plant species used for bioremediation: Astragalus incanus L. (no common name), Creeping saltbush (Atriplex semibaccata R. Br. L.), Old Man saltbush (Atriplex nummularia Lindl. L.), Indian mustard (Brassica juncea Czern L.), tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb. L.), canola (Brassica napus L.), birdsfoot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus L.), and kenaf (Hibiscus cannabinus L.). In Experiment I, all five plant species, especially Indian mustard, accumulated and lowered soil Se concentrations more effectively when grown in selenate-treated soil than selenite-treated soil. In Experiment II, plant tissue concentrations of Se and B in Indian mustard increased proportionally to concentrations of Se and B in water culture. In Experiment III, Indian mustard, canola, and tall fescue accumulated and lowered native soil Se and B concentrations when grown under greenhouse conditions. In Experiment IV, Indian mustard accumulated the highest concentration of native soil Se and kenaf accumulated the highest concentration of native soil B under field conditions. Vegetation management with any of the above plant species should be considered as a bioremediation tool for removing boron or selenium from contaminated soils.

AB Sustainable agriculture involves practices that has to fulfil several requirements. The most important limiting aspects are: environmental issues and public health aspects. Pesticide use seemingly is in conflict with these limiting factors because of the general belief that pesticides are hazardous to the environment and to human health. However, long-term experiments demonstrated that pesticides can only temporarily suppress the population of useful as well as harmful insects and other organisms. Under natural conditions, the balance in the composition of insect species is generally restored in a short time period. Furthermore, biochemical evidences show that the toxicity of pesticide residues in food is much lower in test animal experiments than the toxicity of several natural constituents of foods. The only realistic way of sustainable agriculture is to balance chemical and non-chemical control measures by applying integrated pest management (IMP) principles.

AB The increased tempo of developments in biopesticides is closely related to the growing awareness and emphasis on integrated pest management (IPM) and sustainable agriculture. Several economic forecasting sources predict a growth rate for the biopesticide industry at 10 to 15% per annum over the next 10 years in contrast to a 1 to 2% growth rate for synthetic chemical pesticides.
   The greatest opportunity for biopesticides is in the insect pest management arena. This paper discusses several types of bioinsecticides that may have significant economic impact in the coming years.

AB Forest resource managers throughout the nation are being challenged to ensure the long-term sustainability of forest ecosystems. Such efforts often focus on how harvesting activities can be accomplished in a more ecologically sensitive manner, while accommodating increased public interest in the breadth of values associated with forests. During the past six years, objectives of this nature have required the cooperative attention of Minnesota's forestry community. A state with a history of progressive forest policies and a sensitivity to the importance of blending environmental, community, and economic development goals, Minnesota has developed a plan to ensure the sustainability of its forests for those citizens who depend on them.

ID STORMWATER
AB Recent developments in urban storm drainage are reviewed starting with drainage impacts on receiving waters, followed by a brief analysis of selected components of urban drainage systems, hydroinformatics, and regulatory programs. Further advancement in drainage planning will require considerations of the catchment, drainage system, groundwater, treatment plant and receiving waters as one entity, and ensuring sustainable integrated development and ecological enhancement of urban streams and corridors. Such processes should be based on comprehensive modelling, which is well advanced for hydrological aspects, but further development is needed in water quality, sediment quality, transport and impacts, and ecological modelling. Mitigation of stormwater impacts is accomplished by best management practices, which form a part of the treatment train, and their sustainability has to be ensured by proper operation and maintenance. Impacts of combined sewer overflow are mitigated either conventionally by storage (and return to the central wastewater treatment plant), or more recently, by satellite treatment or pollution separation at the overflow points. An improved utilization of the available spare (idle) capacities in the drainage system can be achieved by real-time control. Finally, regulatory programs in various countries indicated a great deal of uncertainty and some aspects of such programs may even impede effective environmental practices.

ID CORPORATIONS; ROLES; FIRM
AB A subsidiary mandate is a business, or element of a business, in which the subsidiary participates and for which it has responsibilities beyond its national market, This research studied thirty-one mandates in six Canadian subsidiaries of U.S.-owned multinational corporations, A life-cycle framework was proposed, and used to explore the factors associated with the gain, development and loss of mandates by subsidiaries, Two key findings emerged, First, it was shown that there is a risk in having a full-scope world product mandate, because it is possible to become marginal to the corporate strategy, Second, it was observed that the engine of subsidiary growth is its distinctive capabilities, and that for a mandate to be effective it must be built on those capabilities, Implications for mandate sustainability are proposed on the basis of these two insights.

AB Life cycle assessments to protect global environment and to control waste in the polymer industry are reviewed. The focus is on 1) environmentally sound technology, 2) energy conservation, and 3) recycling of industrial products. The competitiveness of a nation depends on how it balances economic development of sustainable growth and responsible care of the global environment in a borderless economy. It fully depends on the development of both environmentally sound manufacturing and effective recycling technologies for the products. Current environmental issues of the Japanese chemical industries as well as Toray's performance and new products development for environment business are reviewed: 1) Energy conservation and technology of the Japanese manufacturing industry, 2) Development of environmentally sound technology, 3) Effective products recycling technologies, and 4) Sustainable growth in the new chemical age. The future issues of life cycle assessment and environmental protection in manufacturing industries are discussed.

AB Traditional approaches to studying competitive advantage, while valuable, are not adequate to explain how firms can operate effectively in turbulent and often chaotic environments. A resource or skill-based view focusing on development and application of core competences is offered to supplement the traditional approaches. We present a model of the development and outcomes of dynamic core competences based on organizational meta-learning. A firm's core competence(s) is defined as a set of problem-defining and problem-solving insights that fosters the development of idiosyncratic strategic growth alternatives. Dynamic cove competences ave based on the integration into systemic meta-learning of universal and tacit knowledge through information transfer redefinition of heuristics and continuous improvement based on experimentation and the development of firm-specific skills based on dynamic routines. Dynamic cove competences can be leveraged to create growth alternatives of global diversification, new applications of existing technologies and/or the development of new fines of business. Finally, dynamic cove competences can be used to reduce uncertainty and to induce path dependencies that create causal ambiguity (making imitation from other firms difficult). In so doing, they can form the basis of competitive advantages.

DT Article
AB To contribute to the development of methodological approaches to coastal area management consistent with the sustainable development concept and guidelines provided by UNCED Agenda 21, Chapter 17, first the classifications of coastal uses provided by literature and those adopted by coastal management programmes are presented and discussed. Moving from this basis and reasoning in terms of general system-sustained approach the following concepts and methodological issues are considered: a goal-oriented concept of coastal use; the sustainable development-grounded coastal use framework and the role of discriminants through which it is conceived and described; the relationships between coastal uses; in particular, conflicting relationships focusing attention on conflicts between decision-making centres, as well as users, motivations and tractability of uses; the relationships between coastal uses and the ecosystem; the basic: options for sustainability-consistent coastal use development.

AB This paper is intended as a companion to the paper 'Existence of non-cooperative equilibria in social systems by Prakash and Sertel (1974b) appearing in this volume. It aims to perform two tasks: (1) to give the reader a glimpse at the literature relevant to the existence of equilibria in social systems as it has developed since the writing of the Prakash and Sertel (PS) paper; and (2) to provide a class of examples illustrating where the PS notions of a social system and the non-cooperative equilibrium of a social system generalize the well-known concepts of games, abstract economies and their associated equilibria, showing how the existence theory of PS even today bears economic results beyond where alternative theories are applicable.

TI Purified ferritin and soybean meal can be sources of iron for treating
   iron deficiency in rats
SO JOURNAL OF NUTRITION

DT Article
DE ferritin; iron deficiency; rats; soybeans
ID MESSENGER-RNA; BIOAVAILABILITY; PHYTATE; CELLS
AB Ferritin and soybean meal were reevaluated as dietary treatments of iron deficiency in rats. Isotopes that had been used in the past were avoided because of contemporary knowledge of the physiological and structural complexity of ferritin protein and the solid iron mineral. Rats made anemic by iron-deficient diets were given equivalent amounts of iron as FeSO4, horse spleen ferritin, baked soybean meal, or soybean meal plus ferritin. Full recovery (89-109%) from anemia and increased tissue iron occurred after 28 d of treatment with any of the iron sources, which contrasts to past bioavailability studies using Fe-59-labeled ferritin and generally shorter periods of observation. Cultivar-specific variability was observed in soybean seed soluble iron and ferritin content (1.9-2.0 times the control cultivar, Arksoy), which was apparently heritable. The combined data suggest that manipulating ferritin expression and other soluble components of seed iron in soybeans and possibly other seeds, using Mendelian and biotechnological approaches, could contribute to a sustainable solution to global problems of iron deficiency.

TI Tolerance of barley cultivars to an acid, aluminum-toxic subsoil related
   to mineral element concentrations in their shoots
SO JOURNAL OF PLANT NUTRITION
LA English
DT Article
ID DIFFERENTIAL RESPONSE; PHOSPHORUS; WHEAT; SOIL; GENOTYPES; VARIETIES;
   LEAVES; PLANTS
AB Barley, Hordeum vulgare L., is extremely sensitive to excess soluble or exchangeable aluminum (Al) in acid soils having pH values below about 5.5. Aluminum tolerant cultivars are needed for use in rotations with potatoes which require a soil pH below 5.5 for control of scab disease. They are also potentially useful in the currently popular ''low input, sustainable agriculture (LISA)'' in which liming even the plow layer of soil is not always possible or cost effective, or in situations where surface soils are limed but subsoils are acidic and Al toxic to roots. Ten barley cultivars were screened for Al tolerance by growing them for 25 days in greenhouse pots of acid, Al-toxic Tatum subsoil (clayey, mixed, thermic, typic Hapludult) treated with either 750 or 4000 mu g . g(-1) CaCO3 to produce final soil pH values of 4.4 and 5.7, respectively. Based on relative shoot dry weight (weight at pH 4.4/weight at pH 5.7 X 100), Tennessee Winter 52, Volla (England), Dayton and Herta (Denmark) were significantly more tolerant to the acid soil than Herta (Hungary), Kearney, Nebar, Dicktoo, Kenbar and Dundy cultivars. Relative shoot dry weights averaged 28.6% for tolerant and 14.1% for sensitive cultivar groups. Comparable relative root dry weights were 41.7% and 13.7% for tolerant and sensitive cultivars, respectively. At pH 4.4, Al concentrations were nearly three times as high in shoots of sensitive cultivars as in those of the tolerant group (646 vs. 175 mu g-g(-1)), but these differences were reduced or absent at pH 5.7. At pH 4.4, acid soil sensitive cultivars also accumulated phosphorus concentrations that were twice as high as those in tolerant cultivars (1.2% vs. 0.64%). At pH 5.7, these P differences were equalized at about 0.7% for both tolerant and sensitive groups. At pH 4.4, shoots of the Al-sensitive cultivar Nebar contained 1067 mu g . g(-1) Al and 1.5% P. Concentrations of Al acid P in the shoots of acid soil sensitive cultivars grown at pH 4.4 exceeded levels reported to produce toxicity in barley. The observed accumulation of such concentrations of Al and P in the shoots of plants grown under Al stress is unusual and deserves further study.

TI Product hierarchy and brand strategy influences on the order of entry
   effect for consumer packaged goods
SO JOURNAL OF PRODUCT INNOVATION MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID CONSIDERATION SET COMPOSITION; MARKET SHARE; PIONEERING ADVANTAGE;
   EXTENSIONS; CHOICE; MODEL
AB Manufacturers focus on becoming more agile, software firms deploy rapid application development tools-everyone is in a hurry. Although we all understand the benefits of being first to market, we understand just as clearly that not all first-to-market products enjoy the same, sustainable benefits from being market pioneers. Why do some pioneering products experience a more significant order-of-entry effect than others?
   Roger A. Kerin, Gurumurthy Kalyanaram, and Daniel J. Howard examine two factors-product hierarchy and brand strategy-which may influence the magnitude of this effect for new consumer packaged goods. First, they hypothesize that pioneering a new product class offers a greater advantage than introducing a new form to an existing product class. Second, they predict that the order-of-entry effect will be greater for brand extensions than for entirely new brands. Finally, considering both product hierarchy and brand strategy, they expect that the order-of-entry advantage for brand extensions over new brands will be significantly greater within new product classes than for new forms of existing products.
   These hypotheses are tested using data from the Information Resources, Inc. Behaviorscan(R) data set. Collected from 2,500 household panel members, 75 supermarkets, and 25 drugstores, this database contains weekly measures of brand trial penetration as well as brand distribution, price, and promotion information in eight geographic markets from the period 1983-1988. The models developed in this study explore the relationships among brand trial penetration, product hierarchy, brand strategy, order of entry, lag time between successive brand entrants, and marketing mix variables (i.e., price, promotion, distribution, and advertising).
   The study strongly supports all three hypotheses. In particular the analysis clearly demonstrates that the order-of-entry effect is greatest for a new product class pioneered by a brand extension. Order of entry has the least effect on a new product form pioneered by an entirely new brand. For a company seeking a competitive advantage from being first to market, innovation ill product function offers greater potential benefit than innovation in product form. Such a company can also benefit from building on the name and reputation of its established brands. Although the study finds these order-of-entry effects significant, the effects of marketing mix variables such as product price and promotion are consistently stronger.

TI Our relationship with the ecosystem and its impact on sustainable
   agriculture
SO JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
AB Our relationship with the ecosystem affects our treatment of it and our perception of sustainable agriculture. If we are honest with ourselves and live according to our espoused philosophy-or religion-we exalt one of four entities: the ecosystem (geocentrism), everything as essentially equal (acentrism), self and/or our species (anthropocentrism), or God (theocentrism). We must each ask ourselves if our individual philosophy leads to sustainability. Geocentrists believe that human life and welfare are less important than the rest of the ecosystem. Acentrists believe everything is one and part of one essence. Self, others, and the ecosystem are equally extolled. Anthropocentrists believe that people are above the ecosystem with no authority to hold them accountable for their treatment of the ecosystem. The ecosystem is something to be conquered since human interests are put above all other interests. Theocentrists believe that God is in charge and that we were created in part as faithful stewards of the rest of the ecosystem. The geocentric view is not sustainable from a human perspective because geocentrists, in valuing themselves below the ecosystem, would ultimately remove themselves from it to conserve resources. Although the acentric view could be sustainable if believers indeed put everything on the same level as themselves, it does not happen in practice. As people think of themselves more humbly, they begin to think of the ecosystem even more humbly and abuse it. The ''tragedy of the commons'' illustrates that the anthropocentric view is not sustainable. The theocentric position is sustainable if believers follow the God-mandated plan of putting God and others above self and seeing themselves as faithful stewards of creation. Regardless of our beliefs, if we put self first, all creation (people as well as the ecosystem) will suffer.

TI Low-cost safe water for the world: A practical interim solution
SO JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH POLICY
LA English
DT Article
ID DRINKING-WATER; TRANSMISSION; CHOLERA; STORAGE
AB A very large segment of the world's population is without a microbiologically safe water supply. It is estimated that in Latin America more than 40% of the population is utilizing water of dubious quality for human consumption. This figure is probably even higher in Africa and areas of southeast Asia. Water used for drinking and food preparation can be an important route of transmission for many of the most widespread and debilitating of the diseases that afflict humans. The cholera pandemic which struck Latin America in January 1991, and has become endemic in many of the countries, continues to exemplify the public health significance of contaminated drinking water. Ideally, this neglected segment of the world's population should be served with piped water systems that provide a continuous supply of microbiologically safe water, but this would require such enormous investments of financial and human resources that it is not reasonable to expect that it will be accomplished. Interim practical measures to assure microbiologically safe water are necessary.
   The public health intervention to accomplish this is described in this paper and has an annual per family cost of which ranges between $1.50 and $4. It consists of providing individual households with one or preferably two suitable water containers in which to disinfect and store the essential quantities of water that need to be free of pathogens, with the containers of a design that will preclude recontamination of the contents and enable the production and distribution of the water disinfectants to be managed at the local level. It includes the necessary component of public education, promotion and involvement to establish the sustainability of the measures as a community-based endeavor.
   Investigation and demonstration projects are being carried out in 11 countries to determine and perfect and appropriate intervention, and it has been proven that it is economically, technically and socially feasible to assure microbiologically safe water for the world's population that is threatened by waterborne diseases. Carefully controlled microbiological analysis of the untreated and treated water shows that waterborne pathogens can be destroyed or inactivated, and carefully controlled epidemiological studies being carried out by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show that this intervention achieves considerable reduction in the incidence of waterborne disease.
   It is recommended that all developing countries initiate programs to replicate the health measure described in this payer in order to test its validity and to adapt it to their local conditions.

SO JOURNAL OF RANGE MANAGEMENT

DT Article
DE ranch management; grazing management; extension education; technology
   transfer
AB Since 1988, University of California Cooperative Extension short courses have been offered to 362 California ranchers and interested participants, The purpose was to assist private rangeland owners and managers in planning ranch goals, monitoring ranch operations, and establishing economically feasible and ecologically sustainable grazing management systems, In 1994, an evaluation study of the short courses was conducted to determine if the rancher participants had initiated successful improvements in their ranching and grazing management, A survey questionnaire mailed to all short course participants had a rancher response rate of 49%. Results of the survey indicate that over three-quarters of the ranchers had family operations, most of which were cow-calf operations, Almost 40% of the ranchers earned more than half of their income directly from their ranching operation, As a result of having taken the short courses, ranchers reported that they had improved or protected 14% of the rangeland which they owned or leased, Over half said that they had increased their ranching profits, A majority of respondents had implemented at least one ranching practice presented in the short course, These changes appear to be motivated from ranchers' needs to increase on-ranch profits through enterprise diversification, to cope with regulatory constraints, and to improve land management for future generations on a family ranch.

TI Indicators of socio-economic sustainability: An application to remote
   rural Scotland
SO JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
ID ENGLAND; AREAS
AB Although commonly used and relatively clearly defined in an environmental context, the concept of sustainability tends to be rather nebulous and confusing in the context of rural socio-economic development. In this paper it is defined in terms of three dimensions, structure, performance and dependence. These dimensions are assessed across three groups of socio-economic attributes, those concerned with demographic development. those relating to economic activity, and those associated with community and culture. The resulting sustainability matrix is a potentially valuable tool for assessing the socio-economic status of rural areas in developed countries. This is demonstrated by its application to remote rural areas in Scotland. In countries such as the U.K., which have a relatively long history of regional assistance, the true demographic and economic sustainability constraints of remote rural areas are to a large degree obscured by substantial transfers from more prosperous regions. This dependence is identified as the most important dimension of rural socio-economic sustainability in the Scottish context.

TI Socio-economic issues in the education of children of migrant fishermen
   in Nigeria
SO JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
AB The fishing industry contributes immensely to the agricultural sector which is the mainstay of the Nigerian economy. The industry is the foundation of all facets of development, particularly the effective provision and management of the productive resources. The migrant fishermen of the Nigerian coastal and riverine areas are greatly educationally disadvantaged. For sustainable development of the fishing industry, it is important to pay attention to the education of the fishermen and their children. Yet the migration of fishermen from one area to another, a concomitant of ecological and socio-economic factors, has profound effects on the education of their children.
   The study identifies the seasonal patterns of migrations of the fishermen and discusses the problems these migrations pose to the children's education. Then it discusses how their socio-economic conditions such as occupations, family structure and size, fishing organization and technology, fish marketing, income level and living standards aggravate the problems. Finally, recommendations are made to mitigate the problems and also provide viable alternative non-formal but functional education for the fishermen's children. Such recommendations also include physical provisions and special curriculum suited to the needs and demands of their peculiar circumstance.

AB Game farming is a contentious issue despite its long history, world-wide. Confusion around the issue is reflected in Canadian provincial legislation, which shows an inconsistency in the approach to regulation of this industry. This paper examines existing legislation and the biological, socio-economic and ethical factors which policy makers should consider when formulating legislation to regulate game farming. If game farming is to be sustainable, the costs for disease control and enforcement of regulations should be internalized. The formulation of enabling legislation for game farming should proceed with extreme caution if viable populations of native wild animals are to be maintained in perpetuity.

AB Surface sealing and crusting on alfisols in the semiarid tropics pose serious limitations to sustainable crop production and environmental quality. This study was conducted to assess some physical properties related to crust formation on a clayey-skeletal, mixed, isohyperthermic Udic Rhodoustalf at the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRTSAT), India. A critical proportion (30 to 40%) of fine textural fractions, particularly silt, appeared to be important in structural crust formation due to aggregate breakdown, rainfall compaction, and particle rearrangement of the surface soil. Significantly higher water dispersible clay percentage (7.1%) and dispersion ratio (0.34) at 60 days after planting (DAP) indicated diminished structural stability and increased slaking tendency of surface aggregates. Infiltration rates decreased by 40 to 60% in tilled bare systems from 0 to 60 DAP. Termite activity appeared to increase cumulative infiltration and steady state infiltration rate although additional research is required to determine the precise nature of its influence on porosity and pore continuity.
   Soil cover and biological components may be manageable factors to improve soil structure and stability, as well as, to reduce crusting and its associated adverse effects in the semi-arid tropics.

AB Crust strength impacts agronomic production through its effect on tillage and planting, seedling emergence and establishment, as well as, runoff and erosion. Therefore, a field experiment was conducted at the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT), India, to evaluate surface crust strength characteristics under six cropping and management systems. Penetration resistance (PR) and shear strength (VS) of surface soil was 50 to 300% higher prior to tillage, under dry and crusted conditions than at 21 and 60 days after tillage (DAT). Cohesion and unconfined compressive strength (UCS) followed similar trends to those of PR and VS with 30 to 65% higher values by 109 DAT compared to 0 and 50 DAT. These results reflected the effect of moisture content as well as crust development from compaction and consolidation of the surface (5-10 mm) soil layer. During the postharvest period PR, VS and needle penetration resistance (NPR) exhibited sharp increases at soil moisture contents less than about 0.10 gg(-1), suggesting possible hardsetting tendency of the soil. Highest NPR (ranging from 1.6-7.2 MPa) occurred at 78 and 156 DAT when visible crusting was apparent. Lower NPR at 156 DAT than at 78 DAT for some treatments was attributed to soil surface micro-variability due to crust cracking, soil faunal activity and excessive drying. Adequate soil cover from crop residue or deep-rooted, prolific perennials such as Cenchrus and Stylosanthes may effectively reduce and ameliorate surface crusting on Alfisols in the semi-arid tropics.

ID PRODUCTIVITY
AB Rainfed crop production in highland Balochistan, Pakistan, is a limited and risky practice due to a wide variation in rainfall. To ascertain the sustainability and economic viability of wheat and barley cultivation under three different water-harvesting treatments, intertemporal and interspatial total factor productivity (TFP) indices respectively were used. In the traditional practice treatment the entire plot is planted. In the 1:1 treatment half the plot is used for water catchment and half is planted; in the 2:1 treatment, two-thirds of the plot is used for water catchment and one-third for planting. Intertemporal TFPs had large fluctuations in both cereals; they were used to determine the slopes of TFP trends, but the assessment of sustainability was unreliable owing to a low number of measurements. Interspatial TFPs showed that wheat under the 1:1 treatment and barley under the 2:1 treatment were the most economically viable. Comparison of crops within a given water-harvesting treatment showed that barley was more productive than wheat under traditional practice and that wheat was more viable than barley under the 1:1 treatment.

ID SOIL PROPERTIES; GRAIN-SORGHUM; NITROGEN; RYE
AB A more sustainable agroecosystem may be obtained by combining cover crops with conservation tillage in grain crop production systems. This study was conducted in 1993 and 1994 on a Maury silt loam (Typic Paleudalfs) soil, at Lexington, Kentucky. The objectives were to evaluate: the effects of hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth) and rye (Secale cereale L.) cover crop on corn (Zea mays L.) yields under no-tillage (NT) and conventional tillage (CT) management; corn yield response to N fertilizer rates under different cover crops and tillage systems; and the effects of two cover crops on selected soil chemical properties. The results showed that corn grain yields were significantly higher under hairy vetch cover crop than under rye cover crop, 7.73 and 7.08 Mg ha(-1), respectively. At least 40 to 60 kg ha(-1) more N was estimated to have been added to the agroecosystem by hairy vetch as compared to rye cover crop. Higher corn yields under NT, 7.62 Mg ha as compared to 7.18 Mg ha(-1) for CT, indicated a more efficient utilization of fertilizer N with NT corn production. The highest corn yields were obtained under a combination of NT with vetch cover crop.

ID GREEN-MANURE CROPS; SPRING WHEAT
AB Alternative soil management practices are needed to replace soil degrading conventional practices and attain sustainable crop production systems. A three year field study was conducted to compare conventional (CNV, tilled fallow with conventional tillage), chemical (CHM, chemical fallow with zero tillage) and alternative (ALT, green manure with reduced tillage) fallow in terms of crop production, weed growth and changes in soil properties. The plots were under the three fallow systems in 1990 and were used to grow spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in 1991 and canola (Brassica campestris L.) in 1992. Total dry matter of wheat (CNV = 4795, ALT = 7717, and CHM = 3527 kg ha(-1)), wheat grain yield (CNV = 2080, ALT = 3118, and CHM = 1554 kg ha(-1)) and canola grain yield (CNV = 688, ALT = 892, and CHM = 545 kg ha(-1)) were significantly higher under ALT than under either of the other systems. Yield gains from wheat and canola under ALT provided additional net income of CDN$ 131 ha(-1) over the CNV system. Weed populations indicated that neither tillage nor herbicides provided an effective control across the weed species. Green manure significantly increased the soil NO3-N content under ALT. As the alternative system resulted in higher crop production, economic benefit and improved soil fertility, it was considered to be better than the other two systems.

TI Agrosilvopastoral systems: A practical approach toward sustainable
   agriculture
SO JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
AB The practical objective of agrosilvopastoral (ASPS) systems, in areas fundamentally devoted to cattle production, is to produce goods, traditionally forestry goods such as fuelwood, poles, and timber. These goods are used to solve immediate domestic needs, to provide for local needs and also to alleviate the pressure on natural forests.
   By definition, ASPS is a collective name for land-use systems, implying the combination or deliberate association of a woody component (trees or shrubs) with cattle in the same site. Essentially, these systems are a model of production and conservation based on silvicultural practices complementary to pre-existing agricultural activities. From this point of view, these practices may be applied in a wide range of ecological and productive conditions. Based on this framework, several activities to achieve ASPS are proposed.

TI Rain water and soil fertility management for sustainable cropping on

SO JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
AB A study was undertaken to determine the effect of growing sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.) and maize (Zea mays L.) crops in furrows of tied ridges (TR) designed to conserve and concentrate rain water in the root zone, with inorganic fertilizer applications to increase soil fertility. Field trials were conducted on farmers' fields on sandy soils in semi-arid south-east lowveld of Zimbabwe in 1990/91, 1991/92 and 1992/93 summer seasons. One metre TR significantly increased yields compared to sowing on flat land in 1990/91. Temporal water logging and leaching of nutrients, especially in 1.5 m TR, reduced yields in 1992/93. The optimum fertilizer level for grain and stover yields was 25 kg N/ha compared to 0, 50, and 75 kg N/ha. Harvest indices for sorghum in tied ridges were significantly higher than those on the flat land in 1990/91 but not in 1992/93. Harvest indices for maize in tied ridges were significantly higher than those on the flat land only at one site in 1992/93. Nitrogen fertilizer generally increased harvest indices for both crops but most of the differences were not significant.

AB Growth in motor vehicle ownership and use is often seen as an inevitable outcome of increasing GDP and incomes. This paper reviews the range of modal orientations of contemporary metropolitan areas and uses case studies from China, Japan and Indonesia to illustrate how motorization is influenced by public policies regarding street-space allocation and use, transportation subsidies and transportation system investments, which in turn are influenced by both domestic and international commercial relations. Policies adopted across much of Asia are today promoting rapid motorization and the destruction of economically and environmentally sustainable low-cost non-motorized transportation modes.

AB Since EEC regulation 2078/92 has come into effect, there has been a considerable increase in funds being allocated to the promotion of ''environmentally sustainable agricultural production'' in the Federal Republic of Germany. Particularly in the 'new' federal states, EEC 2078/92 contributed to a remarkable increase in total financial resources, mainly as a result of more favourable co-financing possibilities for objective I-regions. However, prescribed proportional contribution by individual federal states did not increase on the same scale.
   Analysis of the use of funds, differentiating 'old' and 'new' federal states as well as individual federal states shows clear differences in fund origins and distribution among various sectors of extensivation in the phase before as well as after introduction of the EEC 2078/92. Because of these differences and differences in support conditions and objectives, it is to be expected that agricultures contribution based on governmental support to ''environmentally sustainable agricultural production'' will vary in the future in individual federal states.

DT Article
AB Many efforts are made to evaluate the fertiliser demands of crops by analysing soils and plants and to establish recommendation schemes. But when it comes to the application of nutrients in the field all operations are done more ore less blindfolded because a: the analysed samples are taken randomly distributed they can never reflect the true spatial variability in the soil environment and b: fertilisers are distributed evenly which result in a side by side of ecological and economical unsatisfying over- and undersupply of the plants. Local Resource Management (LRM) is a more consistent term for what is handled outside Germany as ''Precision Farming''. LRM is based on the idea that addressing the spatial variability of soil fertility parameters is the most promising approach to improve the utilisation of inputs towards a more sustainable agriculture. The use of nutrients for instance is a good example to highlight the problems for which LRM will be the future solution.

AB This paper investigates the stock-recruitment and equilibrium yield dynamics for the two species of tiger prawns (Penaeus esculentus and Penaeus semisulcatus) in Australia's most productive prawn fishery: the Northern Prawn Fishery. Commercial trawl logbooks for 1970-93 and research surveys are used to develop population models for these prawns. A population model that incorporates continuous recruitment is developed. Annual spawning stock and recruitment indices are then estimated from the population model. Spawning stock indices represent the abundance of female prawns that are likely to spawn; recruitment indices represent the abundance of all prawns less than a certain size.
   The relationships between spawning stock and subsequent recruitment (SRR), between recruitment and subsequent spawning stock (RSR), and between recruitment and commercial catch were estimated through maximum-likelihood models that incorporated autoregressive terms. Yield as a function of fishing effort was estimated by constraining to equilibrium the SRR and RSR. The resulting production model was then used to determine maximum sustainable yield (MSY) and its corresponding fishing effort (f(MSY)).
   Long-term yield estimates for the two tiger prawn species range between 3700 and 5300 t. The fishing effort at present is close to the level that should produce MSY for both species of tiger prawns. However, current landings, recruitment and spawning stock are below the equilibrium values predicted by the models. This may be because of uncertainty in the spawning stock-recruitment relationships, a change in carrying capacity, biased estimates of fishing effort, unreliable catch statistics, or simplistic assumptions about stock structure.
   Although our predictions of tiger prawn yields are uncertain, management will soon have to consider new measures to counteract the effects of future increases in fishing effort.

AB Applied geography provides useful skills and opens up new possibilities to geographers in the labour market. In order to gain relevant experience by means of ''learning by doing'', empirical-analytical research was carried out in Klagenfurt's urban fringe and at the lakeshore of Worthersee to provide data for developing a longterm concept for landuse directed towards sustainable development contrapositive to other planning proposals. It probably will exercise some influence on future planning decisions concerning this area.

AB Information acquisition is the foremost requirement for the control and continued operation of any complex system. This is especially true when a plant production system is used as a major component in a sustainable life support system. The plant production system not only provides food and fiber but is a means of providing critically needed life supporting elements such as O-2 and purified H2O. The success of the plant production system relies on close monitoring and control of the production system.
   Machine vision technology was evaluated for the monitoring of plant health and development and showed promising results. Spectral and morphological characteristics of a model plant were studied under various artificially induced stress conditions. From the spectroscopic studies, it was found that the stresses can be determined from visual and non-visual symptoms. The development of the plant can also be quantified using a video image analysis base approach. The correlations between the qualities of the model plant and machine vision measured spectral features were established. The success of the research has shown a great potential in building an automated, closed-loop plant production system in controlled environments.

AB The Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS) is a scientifically based comprehensive international programme to collect and disseminate ocean data and products for economic, environmental, health, educational, research and other practical benefits to society. Among the components of GOOS is a module on the Health of the Oceans (HOTO). it has been designed to contribute directly to, firstly, our general understanding of the present status and future trends in global ocean health and, secondly, the ability of state and national governments to obtain socio-economic benefits derived from sustainable development and use of ocean/coastal areas, Suites of physical, chemical and biological measurements have been proposed for addressing the key problem areas associated with the impact of human activities on ocean health, Three interlinked sets of measurements are envisaged, relating to: habitat studies; chemical, biochemical and physical analytes; and biological effects and indications of ecosystem health, In contributing to the overall design of GOOS, the aim is to provide a vastly improved store of basis marine environmental data with higher spatial and temporal resolution than available ever before.

AB Sustainability cannot be achieved without the support of people knowledgeable and motivated - primarily through education and awareness - to modify behaviour and lifestyles, and to press for change by government and business. A new international consensus on the critical importance of education for sustainable development has emerged from the series of recent UN Conferences, beginning with the UN Conference on Environment and Development (Rio de Janeiro, 1992) and followed by conferences on population, social development, women, and human settlements. Fresh impetus has been given by the decision in April 1996 of the UN Commission on Sustainable Development to initiate a work programme on Chapter 36 of Agenda 21, the action plan of the Rio Conference, It was agreed by this body of national governments that there is need to refine the concept and key messages of education for sustainable development (ESD). A holistic understanding across the disciplines is needed in order to accommodate the still evolving concept of sustainability. A key ally in this endeavour is environmental education which, since the Stockholm Conference on the Human Environment of 1972, has built up valuable experience, as well as organizational and communications networks, Professionals engaged in environmental education now need to work together with those from population education, economics, religion and other humanities and social sciences, including human rights and values education.

AB When looking broadly at the current picture of the world's land surface, it appears that three major types of land use can be recognized: urbanized areas, areas of intensive agricultural production, and areas that are more or less 'natural', with a low human density. At the present time, rapid changes in land occupation resulting from generalized urban growth and from contrasted trends in agricultural practices are taking place everywhere. The Mediterranean basin, with its different demographic and socio-economic conditions in the north and in the south and east is to a large extent representative of this world-wide trend. Using the experience of the Blue Plan, which combines systemic analysis and future-oriented approaches to study the interactions between demography, natural resources, environment and development, simple contrasted scenarios can be built to explore changes in the three types of land use around this entire basin. This exercise shows that in a 'sustainable development' scenario, the biosphere reserve type of approach provides a favourable counterpart to urbanization and to intensive agriculture, resulting in a more balanced use of land at the regional scale, and leading in particular to lower pressure towards urbanization and to higher standards of living in the more natural areas of the countries concerned.

AB Soil characteristics were examined within and adjacent to two vegetation exclosures near Porters Pass, Canterbury retired from grazing 45 years ago. Soils were analysed for a range of simple physical (topsoil depth, bulk density), chemical (pH, exchangeable cations, P, S, total C and N) and biochemical (microbial carbon) properties to determine whether the vegetation recovery inside the exclosures was reflected in soil differences. At both sites there were few significant differences between the exclosure and the surrounding grazed area, despite vegetation recovery since exclusion of grazing. At Starvation Gully topsoil depth and Na were higher, and bulk density, pH, K, total C, total N and microbial C mass, and the microbial C to total C ratio were lower in the exclosure. At Cloudy Knell Ca, Mg, total C and N were higher and Na was lower in the exclosure. There was a marked contrast in the trends at the two sites, with slightly lower nutrient status and organic matter in the exclosure at Starvation Gully, and the reverse at Cloudy Knell. The differences between the sites probably reflect differences in the partitioning of nutrients and organic matter between vegetation, litter and soil at the two sites. The results suggest a slow rate of change of soil properties following cessation of grazing and the need to sample soils, litter and vegetation when determining trends in organic matter and chemical fertility.

AB The transfers of native and applied K in a rhodic Ferralsol were studied in an agrosystem of southern Togo to propose sustainable cultivation strategies for K in kaolinitic soils. Potassium balance was measured over two years in field conditions under continuous maize cultivation with two K fertilisation levels (0 and 137 kg K ha(-1) yr(-1)). Potassium leaching below the root zone, determined using ceramic cup samplers and Darcy's law, was on average 7.5 kg K ha(-1) yr(-1) with K fertilisation, i.e. 2% of the quantity of K applied, and 4.5 kg K ha(-1) yr(-1) without. The low leaching values resulted from a K concentration lower than 130 mu M in the soil solution. The low K concentration in the soil solution was related to selective adsorption of K increased by a low content of exchangeable K, with a Gapon selectivity coefficient ranging from 7.9 and 11.5 M(-0.5). So the level of exchangeable K must first be increased to raise K concentration in the soil solution. The fixation and release of K was analysed using the isotopic exchange method with K-42-ions and compartmental analysis of the kinetics of isotopic exchange. Potassium fixed in a form non available within one year accounted for 78% of the difference between the two treatments. The annual amount of K fertilisation must thus be based on the quantity of K removed in the grain and crop residues, with an extra addition to account for K fixation. Given a crop residue content of 85 kg K ha(-1) yr(-1) in the fertilised treatment, the return of crop residues is essential if sustainability is to be achieved with traditional cropping systems where little K fertiliser is added.

AB Long-term field experiments play an important role in understanding the complex interactions of plants, soils, climate and management and their effects on sustainable crop production. A long-term fertilizer experiment with maize-wheat-cowpea (fodder) is in progress since 1971 at Punjab Agricultural University farm Ludhiana, India. The experimental result for the first 21 years showed that application of N alone or in combination with P did not produce as much maize and wheat grains a the; applications of N P and K together. Eight years after thp start nf thp experiment, the optimal levels of N, P and K application (100% NPK) were unable to sustain the similar (maize) yield level as before because of Zn deficiency. Whereas in FYM amended plots the Zn deficiency did not appear and the higher crop yields could be sustained. The chemical control of weeds could not sustain the maize productivity at the same level as the manual removal of weeds. IL was concluded that the high level of crop production can be sustained with the application of N, P and K under intensive cropping system provided deficiency of any of the micronutrient does not crop up. The deficiency of Zn is most likely to occur in semi-arid light textured alluvial soils under intensive cropping without the addition of farm yard manure/organic manures. In maize based cropping systems, manual control of weeds may be preferred to the chemical one. Addition of FYM in conjunction with 100% NPK is most beneficial both from bio-physical and economic point of view.

AB Australia's fisheries, although relatively modest by international standards, are a significant part of the national economy and have a traditional place in our culture, Most of Australia's commercial fisheries are at or near frill exploitation and face threats from a number of sources, including overfishing ann habitat destruction. Recreational fishing continues to increase. The sustainable exploitation of fisher ies is increasingly viewed within a broader context of coastal zone manage ment. This will lend to greater emphasis being placed on the ecological basis for fisheries management and a move away from the single species/gear approach. Developing management regimes capable of coping with this complexity remains an active area of endeavour and includes considerations of the relative merits of input versus output controls, the efficacy of marine harvest refugia and the relative roles of traditional users, and the commercial and recreational sectors is increasingly important.

AB A new framework for coastal planning is evolving in New Zealand. Of particular significance is the enactment of the Resource Management Act 1991, which aims to promote the sustainable management of the country's natural and physical resources. This is to be achieved through a series of national policy statements and plans and district plans. The Act requires resource managers to concentrate more on the 'effects' of activities and less on the activities themselves. The Act also places a greater emphasis on the justification of the 'methods' or 'means' (such as provision of information) chosen to address coastal planning issues than has been necessary in the past. This paper provides information about the New Zealand coastal management regime and illustrates how five regional councils (Auckland, Waikato, Taranki, Hawkes Bay and Wellington) have used a combination of methods in dealing with water quality issues. Generally, regional coastal plans in New Zealand should be seen as facilitative documents within absolute environmental limits set by the Act. While it is not yet possible to evaluate the effectiveness of methods chosen by regional councils, this paper shows that prescriptive planning or regulation is used selectively, placing greater responsibility on industry and individuals in the community to develop local initiatives to improve coastal management.

AB The establishment of a marine reserve at Jervis Bay was proposed in 1994. The aim of the proposal was to ensure the environmental sustainability of an important coastal resource which is subjected to multiple uses. However, there was not unanimous approval for the proposal. This paper describes the proposal and discusses the results of a sample survey carried out to obtain information about peoples' use of the bay and their attitudes towards a marine reserve. A case is made for treating environmental management as conflict management and giving more attention to critics and opponents of the proposal. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd.

SO OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English

ID MARINE RESERVES; PHILIPPINE
AB In spite of the productive potential of coastal environments, fish supplies to coastal communities are decreasing The causes of the decline in landings from coastal fisheries are many bur the most serious and intractable problem is increasing human populations leading to the over-exploitation of coastal fisheries. In this article ideas are presented for the development of a new way of using coastal waters, called Sustainable Coastal Production Systems (SCPS), which may transform parts of the coast from abused and over used ecosystems to productive systems which are integrated and under local control. As proposed, SCPS depends on integration at different levels. At the 'aquaculture' level components are energetically linked; system design includes species that will complement each other. In SCPS a variety of trophic levels should be maintained and their interactions managed to maximize the benefits from the whole system, fully utilizing available energy while reducing inputs. The SCPS is fully integrated with the local ecology instead of considering the surrounding waters as external and a source of threats (fouling and predators). The question of scale of SCPS has to do as much With the distribution of benefits to human populations as it does with the biophysical factors. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB The author surveys some of the principal amendments to the Barcelona system adopted at the Ninth Ordinary Meeting of Contracting Parties to the Barcelona Convention in June 1995 and underlines the new national responsibilities for the implementation of the policy, legal and institutional changes in the direction of sustainable development. Emphasis is placed on the types of human resources that will be needed to facilitate implementation and render the regime effective at both national and regional levels. The author advocates a role for Mediterranean universities to assist regional regime-building through the development of relevant marine affairs education programmes in support of the Mediterranean Action Plan (MAP). A catalytic role for the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)/MAP Coordinating Unit in mobilizing inter-university cooperation is also identified. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd.

TI Geographical coverage and effectiveness of the UNEP Convention on the
   Mediterranean
SO OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB The consideration of the regional scale, Intended as a multi-national scale (grand espace according to the French terminology), has acquired political importance because of three factors:
   1. the adoption of a regional approach by the international Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP) and the emerging need for a similar approach within Human Dimensions of Environmental Global Change Programme (HDEGCP), briefly called Human Dimensions Programme (HDP);
   2. the recommendations by Agenda 21, United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED, 1992), to undertake sustainable development-aimed actions on all the scales, including the regional (multi-national) scale;
   3. the design and implementation of the Regional Seas Programme, United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP), which for the first time hers dealt with ocean management on the regional scale.
   Moving from this basis, the Mediterranean region, i.e. the space extending from the Straits of Gibraltar to the Sea of Azov, has gained special geopolitical relevance, inter alia due to the geopolitical changes after the end of the cold war, the adoption of the UNEP Mediterranean Action Plan (1976) and its implementation (1995), in association with the Barcelona Convention (1976, amended in 1995), as well as the adoption of the Action Plan for the Black Sea (1994).
   In this context two crucial issues will be considered: (1) the geographical coverage of the UNEP/MAP Convention on the Mediterranean Sea and its role for the management of natural resource uses; and (2) the membership geographical coverage by which the Convention and its related protocols have been characterised. The combined analysis will lead us to focus on the efficacy of the Convention and the effectiveness of the subsequent political actions. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd.

TI Integrated coastal and marine areas management (ICAM) in the

SO OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Coastal Areas Management Programme (CAMP) of the Mediterranean Action Plan (MAP) of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) was initiated in 1988 in order to implement in selected locations the concept of integrated coastal and marine areas management (ICAM). Currently, seven CAMP projects are in different stages of implementation. The main objectives of CAMPs are to introduce or develop the process of integrated planning and management of Mediterranean coastal areas, and to contribute to a sustainable development and environmental protection. Based on the three completed CAMPs (Kastela Bay, Izmir Bay, and Syrian coast) and the fourth CAMP which is near completion (Rhodes island), it can be concluded that the development and implementation of CAMPs in the framework of MAP is very successful and appreciated very much by the national and local institutions involved in their implementation.

TI Management of Mediterranean coastal dunes
SO OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper gives some theoretical concepts of dune management as well as practical examples of how actual measures should be carried out.
   Dune management is defined as all measures aimed at the preservation and restoration of the natural values of a coastal sand dune area. It is essential that bench and foreshore are seen as parts of a whole dune system. Management must take into account all processes within this system. It should aim at nature conservation and wise use of coastal resources and all forms of land use should be ecologically sustainable. Dune management should work as much as possible 'with' the natural processes and not 'against' them.
   Four types of Mediterranean dune systems (including Portugal and SW Spain) are distinguished:: mainland dunes, lagoon-bay barrier dunes, delta dunes and remnant dunes.
   Like in most parts of the world, Mediterranean dunes fulfill several functions at the same time. The following functions will be dealt with: nature management, coastal defence and erosion, dune stabilisation and afforestation, agriculture, tourism and urbanisation, recreation, golf, information and education. The concepts of management which are considered include: sustainable use, large and coherent units, compensation, management planning, environmental impact assessment and function analysis.
   Dune stabilisation is not always considered necessary. In case of stabilisation by planting, only indigenous species should be used, preferably pioneers and not trees. Planting of exotic species should be avoided. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd.

TI Impacts of sea-level rise on the Ebro Delta: A first approach
SO OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID COASTAL
AB Global climatic change is taking place and it will likely affect Mediterranean deltas and other low-lying coastal regions in terms of sea-level rise, salinity increase and changes ill temperature and weather patterns. This will have serious implications because these deltas are very valuable in terms of natural resources and related economic activities. This study focuses on one of the northwestern Mediterranean deltas, namely that of the Ebro river. There is an enormous lack of information about and understanding of the integral functioning of this type of system. The objective of this ongoing study is to determine the vulnerability and response of this deltaic system to climate change, such that informed decision-making can be made. In order to do this it is proposed to make combined use of existing and new field measurements (sedimentation, soil formation and coastal fringe response) and an integrated (physical/ecological) conceptual model of deltaic behaviour. Using these tools, organized in relation to the interaction with socio-economic components, a number of intervention scenarios, aiming to cope with the effects of climate change, will be examined in a later stage of the research project. it is expected that these results will provide valuable information for integrated, comprehensive approaches to determine whether management plans are sustainable.

AB The conception of sustainable resource development worked out under the initiative of the United Nations (UN) actualizes ideas for improving the health of people and the environment. The needs of people are to be addressed and, simultaneously, natural resources preserved. That is why ecological and economic expenses are to be integrated and flow sheets of industrial plants are to be reorganized in order to utilize natural resources in a rational way. The association of Estonia with the resolution of the UN Conference on Environmental Development held in Rio de Janeiro and the resolution of the Estonian Parliament concerning The National Program of Sustainable Development require changes in our lifestyle. Chemical education in schools has to support a change in the way of thinking and many concrete subjects can be connected with the problems of sustainable development [I].
   This paper deals with some problems concerning fuel energetics and environmental pollution from the aspect of teaching chemistry.

DE currency crisis; dollarization; government credibility
AB This paper evaluates the current literature on dollarization and finds it to be disappointing in its ability to explain many of the prevailing features of the dollarization experiences in Latin America, Eastern Europe and the Former Soviet Union. The paper takes a different approach to the standard empirical studies, which usually extend a demand for money function to include international variables, by analyzing foreign currency holding behavior in response to the sustainability and credibility of the exchange rate regime. The results are very promising and explain some of the previously unexplained phenomena which arise from dollarization.

TI Effective strategic management with hyperknowledge: The Woodstrat case
SO PAPERI JA PUU-PAPER AND TIMBER
LA English
DT Article
AB Strategic management is defined as the system of action programs which form sustainable competitive advantages for a corporation, its divisions and its business units in a strategic planning period.
   We have developed a system called Woodstrat to serve ns a support system far these action program activities on the corporate, divisional and business unit levels. The system is modular and is built around the logic of strategic management, i.e. the main modules cover the market position, the competitive position, The production position, profit-ability and financing positions. The innovation in Woodstrat is that these modules are linked together: a strong marker position will hare nn immediate positive impact un profitability through hyperknowledge links running from market assumptions to the projected profit/loss statement; there are similar links making the competitive position interact with the market position, and the production position interacts with the market, competitive, profitability and financing positions.
   The intermodular links are based on expert knowledge on strategic management; expert knowledge is also used to guide the user through the process of working out sustainable competitive advantages. The process is made user-supportive with a hyperknowledge user interface. The support is made intuitive and effective with the use of object-oriented programming methods. The basis for this is somewhat non-standard: Woodstrat was built as a hybrid system with Visual Basic in which objects were designed to represent expert knowledge and to create a hyperknowledge environment.

AB We examined the effects of variable body temperature on exercise recovery in the desert iguana, Dipsosaurus dorsalis, because both temperature and nonsustainable activity play an important role in the life history of ectothermic tetrapods. We measured the rate of oxygen consumption (V over dot (O2)), the cost of nonsustainable locomotion (C-ns), blood and muscle lactate concentrations, and muscle glycogen concentrations of Dipsosaurus at 20 degrees C and 40 degrees C before, during and after exhaustive activity. We expected that low recovery temperatures would retard most aspects of metabolic recovery Animals that exercised and recovered at 40 degrees C maintained significantly higher V over dot (O2)'s and returned to temperature-appropriate resting V over dot (O2)'s more rapidly than did animals that exercised and recovered at 20 degrees C. Animals that exercised and recovered at 20 degrees C also had a greater average C-ns than did animals that exercised and recovered at 40 degrees C (4.6 vs. 2.5 mu L O-2/(g X m)). The Q(10) values for V over dot (O2) were highly variable and ranged from 1.3 to 1.9 throughout recovery. In contrast, Dipsosaurus that exercised at 40 degrees C and recovered at 20 degrees C returned to temperature-appropriate resting V over dot (O2)'s more rapidly than animals that exercised and recovered at 40 degrees C. The C-ns was lower in animals that exercised at 40 degrees C and recovered at 20 degrees C than in animals that exercised and recovered at 40 degrees C (1.1 vs. 3.7 mu L O-2/(g X m)). In contrast to those that exercised and recovered at 40 degrees C, animals that exercised and recovered at 20 degrees C did not remove a significant fraction of blood or muscle lactate during 120 min of recovery and did nor replenish a significant portion of their muscle glycogen. Ultimately, it took animals that exercised at 40 degrees C and recovered at 20 degrees C 480 min to remove all of the exercise-generated lactate from their blood, but animals that exercised and recovered at 40 degrees C only required 120 min. The results of this study indicate that recovery temperature has different effects on different aspects of exercise recovery and that, unlike the net cost of sustainable locomotion, C-ns is thermally sensitive.

AB An altitudinal transect was studied at the montane level in a spruce forest, in order to describe changes in humus form dynamics. Whatever the elevation, the periodicity of humus form changes is copied on forest dynamics. Spruce regeneration is restricted both in space and time to favourable micro-site conditions accompanying tree fall gaps. One of these conditions is a shift from moder to mull humus form. As a result, this forest ecosystem shows a space-time mosaic pattern. The recovery of mull humus form takes more time as elevation increases and thus the ratio mull:moder progressively decreases. Simultaneously, burrowing earthworms become scarce. Nevertheless mull humus form does not change basically at increased elevation. On the other hand, moder has little organic matter at the lower montane level. At the mid montane level, accumulation of holorganic faeces into OH horizon is maximum. A mor-moder (few faunal traces) is observed during tree growth phase at the upper montane level. Lack of nutrient availability was hypothesized to explain the observed shift from mull to moder or mor-moder during the phase of intense tree growth. An increased independancy between the building of a moder humus profile and the actual accumulation of organic matter was the main change occurring with elevation. The transition to the subalpine level may thus be defined as the highest elevation up to which the forest ecosystem is able to reverse the mor-building process produced by tree growth. The discoupling between primary producers, plant debris accumulation and decomposers observed in the subalpine spruce forest leads to a breaking point in the carrying capability of humus for spruce seedlings. At high elevation spruce seedlings are mainly observed on rotten wood.
   The influence of humus form dynamics upon forest sustainability was discussed. The lack of humus biological activity at higher elevation was found to be a reason for the weakness of the forest ecosystem faced to the bilberry heath. Forest sustainability depends both on mull and moder. It was observed that moder failed to recover after mull along the forest cycle and turned to mor in harsh climate conditions. Consequences of management practices on the issue of competition between forest and heath were also discussed.

ID SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; MANAGEMENT; LOSSES
AB Continuing increases in flood losses raise a variety of issues, and suggest numerous important research opportunities, from: (1) evidence of persistently incorrect economic analysis of structural flood control; (2) lack of understanding of how subsidies (for navigation, structural versus non-structural mitigation, and parts of agriculture) have defeated or subverted hood policies; and (3) lack of understanding of the distortions of urban form resulting from manipulation of hazard mitigation, induced development and inappropriate incentives for municipalities. Without adequate understanding of these topics, policy will fail to reduce flood losses and improve location of investments, and hood policy will continue to be effectively a legitimating rationale for other purposes. But policy-supportive research in re-analysis, historical analysis, and empirical work awaits only recognition of its value. Failure to do the useful work, however, bodes ill for responses to global change and other threats; the research proposed here would help establish methods badly needed for human dimensions research.

TI Revisiting carrying capacity: Area-based indicators of sustainability
SO POPULATION AND ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Conventional wisdom suggests that because of technology and trade, human carrying capacity is infinitely expandable and therefore virtually irrelevant to demography and development planning. By contrast, this article argues that ecological carrying capacity remains the fundamental basis for demographic accounting. A fundamental question for ecological economics is whether remaining stocks of natural capital are adequate to sustain the anticipated load of the human economy into the next century. Since mainstream (neoclassical) models are blind to ecological structure and function, they cannot even properly address this question. The present article therefore assesses the capital stocks, physical flows, and corresponding ecosystems areas required to support the economy using ''ecological footprint'' analysis. This approach shows that most so-called ''advanced'' countries are running massive unaccounted ecological deficits with the rest of the planet. Since not all countries can be net importers of carrying capacity, the material standards of the wealthy cannot be extended sustainably to even the present world population using prevailing technology. in this light, sustainability may well depend on such measures as greater emphasis on equity in international relationships, significant adjustments to prevailing terms of trade, increasing regional self-reliance, and policies to stimulate a massive increase in the material and energy efficiency of economic activity.

AB Because of continuing acceleration in number of births, in resource use and in many aspects of environmental rundown, including growing destruction of the ecosystem, and encouraged by an exploitive economic system and misuse of technology, the planet's carrying capacity has long been exceeded and any immediate prospect of sustainability has faded. Nearly half the population of the world is below breeding age and, although growth rates are falling in some regions, they are constant in others. Family planning has only been effective in limited areas of the world. Any prospect of demographic transition to lower fertility is uncertain and yet to be realized. The momentum of population growth will continue at present rates for at least another twenty years.

AB The world is changing, and the rate of change is accelerating, nowhere moreso than in the pace of scientific discovery and the advance of technology. The last thirty years have also seen substantial global changes in potato production which are likely to continue if current projections are correct. Climate change is bound to affect local weather patterns, which will influence both the epidemiology of pests and pathogens and broaden their geographic range. An agenda for future research will of necessity include much of the current agenda; research into more sustainable systems; research into new and novel resistances to biotic and abiotic constraints, combining modern cell and molecular-based technologies with classical breeding approaches and research into the genetic and biochemical bases of low temperature sweetening and dormancy control, that should lead to varieties with superior storage characteristics, particularly for processing. However, a future agenda has to retain some flexibility and a component of speculative research. Perhaps potatoes could become a source of industrial feedstock or pharmaceuticals, perhaps there is a place for cultivars produced by botanic seed in Europe? The exciting thing about research is that we cannot always predict where it will lead, and a future agenda must not curb the enthusiasm of any young scientist by too rigidly adhering to that suggested here. It is essential that scientific options are kept open.

ID STRATEGIES
AB From 1983-1994 a community mental health programme was set up in Guinea-Bissau. The first part of the programme concentrated on epidemiological aspects: rural and urban study areas were selected on socio-economic level and participation in the liberation war. A two-stage design was used to screen 351 adult consecutive general health care attenders and 100 children in a rural and an urban area for mental disorder. Psychiatric disorders have a morbidity of 12% among adults seen in Primary Health Care. Disorders were mainly neuroses (74%), but more psychoses were found than in other countries. No statistically significant difference in morbidity was found between rural-urban areas or between previous war and non-war zones. The diagnostic sensitivity of the Primary Health Care workers was 31%, their diagnostic specificity 88%. Thirteen per cent of the children showed neuropsychiatric disturbances. There were no sociocultural impediments to this public mental health approach. During the following intervention programme 850 Primary Health Care workers were trained and supervised nationwide. The diagnostic sensitivity of major mental disorders and epilepsy increased from 31% to an average of 85%. Before the training, their knowledge of the treatment of these disorders was nil whereas after training 82% of the patients received appropriate treatment. Moreover, this model programme shows a profitable cost/benefit ratio and a high sustainability over the last 10 years.

ID MALARIA; SCHISTOSOMIASIS
AB Malaria and schistosomiasis (bilharzia) comprise major health risks in much of sub-Saharan Africa. Technically preventable, improved understanding of local belief and behaviour regarding such diseases is crucial if public health programmes are to prove sustainable. This study examined attributions of cause, suggested means of risk reduction and preferred treatment for the two diseases in a sample of 50 respondents in Mponda, a marshy area within the Southern Region of Malawi, where both malaria and schistosomiasis are endemic. An earlier study in the area (Ager, 1992) had demonstrated that these diseases were considered as unpredictable and often uncontrollable health risks, although adherence to recommended control practices for the diseases was high. In the current study, belief in biomedical means of transmission and adherence to recommended control practices was evidenced by approximately two-thirds of respondents, There were no noted gender differences, but significant age effects in attributions of cause and means of risk reduction for malaria. Attribution of cause and suggested means of control did nor predict preference for treatment, with a preference for medical treatment being widely held. Findings lend support to recent analyses which highlight individual capacity to - in particular circumstances - formulate health and disease processes with respect to alternative conceptual systems (e.g. biomedical or traditional). The implications for health promotion theory and practice in such settings are considered.

AB Nirex's task is the deep disposal of between 200,300 and 275,000 m(3) of intermediate level radioactive waste. The modelling of the disposal concept indicates that 99.9% of the radioactivity will be contained by the multi-barrier system, leaving long-lived species, such as Cl-36, I-129 and U-238 daughter products, as potential sources of exposure through the groundwater pathway. Studies, which started in 1989, show that the potential repository site near Sellafield holds good promise, with a projected peak level of risk within the regulatory target of 10(-6) per year. A five month planning inquiry into the next stage of investigation - the 650-900 m deep Rock Characterisation Facility - has just been completed. Subject to obtaining planning permission for both the rock laboratory and any repository proposal, first waste emplacement could be in 2012. The Nirex programme is consistent with overseas practice and the policy of deep disposal, reaffirmed by Government in 1995, is also consistent with the ethical principle of sustainable development.

AB Alleopathy arises from the release of chemicals by one plant species which affect other species in Its vicinity, usually to their detriment. Such natural compounds are called allelochemicals, As awareness grows of environmental pollution involving the use of synthetic chemicals, and demand increases for sustainability in agriculture and quality food production for humans, attention is being focused on reducing reliance on synthetic chemicals and finding ways to replace them, Allelopathy holds great prospect for meeting such demands.
   Contemporary research in allelopathy focuses on isolating, identifying and quantifying specific active allelochemicals, Once these substances are identified and characterised, they can be used either as natural herbicides or as models for developing new and environmentally-friendly herbicides, Rapid development in analytical technology has made advanced instrumentation (i.e. GC/MS) accessible for general disciplines such as agriculture and allelopathy. This has significantly facilitated tasks of allelochemical identication, rapidly increased understanding of allelopathy, and accelerated its application in agricultural practice.
   In a case of allelopathic research on silvergrass (Vulpia spp,), a significant weed in southern Australia, GC/MS has been employed to characterise the natural toxins. Twenty-one allelochemicals were identified and quantified. Subsequently, their biological activies were tested and identified through a bioassay procedure, which revealed strong correlations between individual phytotoxins and levels of measured phytotoxicity.

AB International trade can increase the choices available for consumers and for firms. The literature on appropriate technology warned us to pay attention to pre-consumption choices. Work on sustainable development alerts us to be equally prudent about post-consumption effects. While it is agreed that the product life cycle approach is highly useful for sustainable development, explicit attention must be given to the consumer, to the consumption period, and to the appropriateness of the product itself. Information on inappropriate products, especially on pharmaceutical exports, demonstrates that emerging markets provide special opportunities for those who sell dangerous or useless products. International action is required, and two initiatives of the United Nations are assessed as methods for implementing the Appropriate Products concept.

LA English
DT Article
AB This article is an encouragement to examine the relationship between human rights, economic, and democratic development from a theoretical and policy perspective. The authors argue that sustainable, long-term democracies are characterized by an absence of ideological extremism in which political and economic discourse is dominated by the ''middle road''. They posit that almost all societies have conflict resolution models but that they have been upset through processes extraneous to those societies. The challenge of the international community is not to try to impose upon those societies new types of conflict of resolution, but to discover what has worked in the past and to remove the obstacles to their effective performance in the future.

TI Nutrient supply and fertilizer use in Eastern Europe
SO ROSTLINNA VYROBA
LA English
DT Article
DE nutrient supply; fertilizers; balanced fertilization
AB Fertilizer use in Eastern Europe has tremendously declined during the last five years. The strong reduction in fertilizer use has led to a decrease of crop yields and increases the economical problems of farms during the period of privatization and restructuring. At present in ail Eastern European countries nutrient balances are negative, in particular for K. That means, farms are working on account of the soil nutrient storages which were established during the last two decades. Nutrient buffering capacities of soils in the Eastern European countries are quite different. In Poland, for example, the frequent occurrence of light sandy soils together with insufficient fertilizer application has caused yield losses in the short-term run. But even in countries with a big share of well buffered fertile soils like Hungary yield levels have been negatively affected during the last three years. For the Eastern European countries this must be regarded as a signal to establish efficient and sustainable agricultural production systems. Farms must be enabled to purchase farm means like fertilizers and use them in an adequate manner to ensure yields and soil fertility.

AB We consider the concepts of aggregate capital value arising in Solow's constant consumption model. For a traditional concept, we establish consumption as interest on wealth in the sense of the interest flow being the vector product of weighted current values of capital stocks and own interest rates. Consumption can be viewed as maximum sustainable net product.

AB For a comprehensive evaluation of human influences on the genetic system, the simulation model EGO-GENE was developed. The model combines population genetic and population dynamic processes with forest growth models. The dynamics of genetic structures (single locus and multilocus genotypes up to 200 loci) can be simulated. Spatial and temporal genetic dynamics are included in the model. Overlapping or separated generations can be created and different modes of mating systems can be implemented. The model can be run with empirical and fictitious input data. The simulated genetic structures can be directly analysed with established genetic analysis programmes. An example demonstrates the use of the model far validation of interactions among components of the mating system. Another example demonstrates the applicability of the model in decision-making for seed sampling strategies. The genetic differences between the adult trees and the harvested seeds and the danger of genetic drift regarding to different seed sampling strategies are investigated by use of the genetic distance and the reproductively effective population size.

AB Containers have been designed to maintain the parameters of a gradient-oriented nutritional procedure that is currently being used for field-grown horticultural crops in Florida. A surface source of N-K or N-P-K in conjunction with a built-in seepage source of water moves by diffusion to equilibrate with the less soluble nutrients in the media (0.08 m(3) of soil or potting mix). The total concept is designed to synchronize nutrient/water inputs with rate of removal by the crop. Even with the higher plant/soil ratio (about 10 times that in the field), the gradient procedure provides long-term nutritional stability in the media solution that creates the potential for advances in productivity. tomato yields of 6 to 10 kg plant(1) with outstanding quality are a reflection of this nutritionally stable rhizosphere. The gradient, in contrast to conventional or hydroponic procedures, is maintained with minimal management. This is true regardless of the soil-plant-season. With the Earth Box(TM)-a gardener's version of the containerized gradient concept-all of the nutrients for one or more crops are placed in the container, the water requirement is limited to the used for transpiration (ther is no leaching), and minimal management is required to maintain the recommended parameters. The potential of the concept as a worldwide sustainable production system is currently being evaluated-for the farmer as well as for the home gardener.

ID PARADIGM
AB The perceived decline of soil science in the industrialized countries needs to be remedied by greater attention (i) to fundamental aspects of soil processes and soil development in the context of global climate change and (ii) to local and regional environmental problems, Soil care is proposed as a unifying concept and challenge for geoecological sustainability, It is defined as the activity of selecting and implementing, locally and regionally, a system of soil and land use management suitable for maintaining and improving soil usefulness and quality for any selected purpose, In developing countries where, in addition, improvement of soil productivity will remain the major goal, more locally trained soil scientists will be needed to increase their relative proportion among the current number of some 50,000 soil scientists worldwide and to narrow the gap in research efforts.

ID NITRATE; LIGNIN
AB Rice (Oryza sativa L.) in wet season (WS) preceded by a dry season (DS) fallow, commonly practiced in rainfed lowlands, causes large losses of N through NO3 leaching and denitrification. The green-manure legumes as NO3 catch crops is economically unattractive to farmers. In a 2-yr study, we (i) assessed productivity of one grain and four forage legumes (pigeonpea [Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp.], crotalaria (Crotalaria juncea L.), clitoria (Clitoria ternatea L.), desmanthus [Desmanthus virgatus (L.) Willd.], and siratro [Macroptilium atropurpureum (Mocino & Sesse ex DC.) Urban]) grown in the DS, (ii) examined NO3-N and NH4-N dynamics in soil (a Typic Tropaquept), and (iii) evaluated legume residues as a N source for succeeding rice. Nitrate-N was dominant in the 30-cm topsoil and was higher under legumes compared with weedy fallow. The legumes produced 4.9 to 9.1 t aboveground biomass ha(-1), accumulated 132 to 306 kg N ha(-1) of which 67 to 81% was derived from N-2 fixation. After harvests, 2.9 to 5.2 t ha(-1) of residues containing 81 to 162 kg N ha(-1) were returned to soil. By 3 to 4 wk after flooding, legume-treated plots had as much as 33 to 40 kg mineral N ha(-1) in topsoil compared with 10 to 13 kg N ha(-1) in weedy fallowed plots. Residues significantly increased rice yield and N uptake. Rice recovered 15 to 31% of the residue N. Fallow plots required 25 to 50 kg fertilizer N ha(-1) to produce comparable plant growth responses to that obtained after the legumes. Belowground residues of the legumes apparently contributed 13 to 37 kg N ha(-1) to rice. Such DS legumes that improve farm productivity as well as increase soil fertility might ensure sustainability of production in rainfed lowlands.

AB Described in this paper is a concept that combines a set of technologies with a set of economic and social concepts that would allow people to create sustainable ecologies for their region or country. As such it describes a possible implementation path.
   The technologies are: solar electricity, power satellites, wireless power transmission, electrolytic hydrogen, and synthetic liquid fuels manufactured from air, water, and electricity. Economic initiatives and policies include creating sustainable economic development regions through the use of tax incentives :and tax penalties. The technologies and economies are brought together by social concepts such as Technopolis and the theory of self-organizing and self-energizing social systems, i.e. creating wealth where there was none through sweat equity. Existing organizational structures such as credit unions, kibbutz's and agricultural and marketing cooperatives provide methods by which global marco-projects can be implemented on a local level. The unique topics of this paper are:
   Creating global markets by solving global problems or how to breakout of the chicken or egg paradox that has stymied the development of energy from space for so long.
   Linking energy availability to self-help economic development programs that create sustainable cultures while benefiting both the local and global environment.
   Integrating solar hydrogen research with energy from space and synthetic liquid fuels.
   Bartering energy for orbital slots and frequency allocations, i.e. energy has foreign aid.
   The proposed approach builds on current distribution systems in use for electricity, natural gas, and liquid fuels.
   We have the technology to expand the horizons and options of mankind, hasten its descent into the swamp of overpopulation, or wipe the slate clean and let nature try again. While the questions of which path will we choose and how will we choose it is beyond the scope of this paper it is within the scope of this paper to map out a possible path. Whether these technologies and concepts are implemented depends on choices made not by engineers and scientists but the people, their governments, and the religious leaders they choose to support for without the development of an ethical system of values that gives equal or greater weight to the importance of the quality of existence with respect to the mandate to procreate technology and economics will never be able to keep up with the growth in population.
   The bottom line of this paper is that linking the concept of baseload energy from Solar Power Satellites to the concepts of a hydrogen energy economy and capitalistic based economic cooperatives could create paths to sustainable futures for the cultures and civilizations of the world. This would expand the horizons and options of mankind while improving or at least maintaining the current quality of our biosphere. The unanswered question is can we do it before we run out of economical and environmentally acceptable recoverable fossil fuel resources.

TI Comparisons between conventional and ecological farming systems at
   Ojebyn - Nutrient flows and balances
SO SWEDISH JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB Nutrient balances of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) in a full scale experiment with conventional and ecological farming systems at Ojebyn in northern Sweden, 1990-1994, were calculated with a nutrient flow model. There was a tendency of yearly increase in N-input to the conventional system through fertilizer and purchased concentrates. In the ecological system a similar, weaker, tendency reflects concentrate purchases. Both tendencies depend on increased milk production. Calculated N-fixation was, on average, twice as large in the ecological system, compared with the conventional one.
   Calculations on N, P and K in manure and urine were validated. In solid manure and urine the model underestimated N and P, whereas K was overestimated. The farm N balance was increasingly positive in the conventional system and negative in the ecological. The P balance was positive in both systems with a higher surplus in the conventional system. The K balance was increasingly positive in the conventional system, but close to being balanced in the ecological. The soil balances were more negative in the ecological system and less positive in the conventional system. The K-balance was clearly negative in the ecological, but more in balance in the conventional system.
   Conclusions are: (1) under existing circumstances ecological farming is possible without immediate DM yield reductions, but with negative effects on soil nutrient balances, (2) sustainability is measured more stringently by soil balance than by farm balance, (3) estimates of N-losses need to be adjusted for north Swedish conditions and (4) fertilization recommendations for P and K in northern Sweden ought to be reconsidered.

AB A clear and appropriate role is presented for the federal government and the national laboratories with respect to technology development, technology utilization and competitiveness. The selective use of federal policy, tools and resources for enhancing economic competitiveness and for providing ''sustainable'' economic development is proposed. A novel approach to a coherent national R&D strategy is advocated with three major components: tax credits, technology facilitation, and federal investment directed towards sustainable competitive participation. Sustainable competitive participation is based on the blending of the concepts of economic competitiveness and sustainable development. Four sectors of technology development and competitiveness are considered for this comprehensive national science and technology strategy. Several examples illustrate are the appropriate federal government and national laboratory role in sustainable competitive participation. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd

CT International ATM Traffic Expert Symposium

AB In ATM networks, a user should negotiate at connection set-up a traffic contract which includes traffic characteristics and requested QoS. The traffic characteristics currently considered are the Peak Cell Rate, the Sustainable Cell Rate, the Intrinsic Burst Tolerance and the Cell Delay Variation (CDV) tolerance(s). The values taken by these traffic parameters characterize the so-called ''Worst Case Traffic'' that is used by CAC procedures for accepting a new connection and allocating resources to it. Conformance to the negotiated traffic characteristics is defined, at the ingress User to Network Interface (UNI) and at subsequent Inter Carrier Interfaces (ICIs), by algorithmic rules based on the Generic Cell Rate Algorithm (GCRA) formalism. Conformance rules are implemented by policing mechanisms that control the traffic submitted by the user and discard excess traffic. It is therefore essential to set traffic characteristic values that are relevant to the considered cell stream, and that ensure that the amount of non-conforming traffic is small. Using a queueing model representation for the GCRA formalism, several methods are available for choosing the traffic characteristics. This paper presents approximate methods and discusses their applicability. We then discuss the problem of obtaining traffic characteristic values for a connection that has crossed a series of switching nodes. This problem is particularly relevant for the traffic contract components corresponding to ICIs that are distant from the original source.

CT International ATM Traffic Expert Symposium
CY 1995
CL BASEL, SWITZERLAND
AB Connection Acceptance Control (CAC) is probably the most important function in the preventive congestion control strategy to be implemented in ATM networks. The CAC function must decide, on the basis of the traffic descriptors provided by an incoming connection, whether the new call can be accepted or not. A key factor in the access decision is the behaviour of the superposition of ATM VCs in a switch output buffer, and in particular the cell loss probability resulting from accepting the connection. Many models have been proposed in the literature in order to investigate this issue. In this paper, we present a survey of the queuing models used to estimate the cell loss probability in ATM networks with straightforward statistical multiplexing. The CAC policy under consideration is based on the so-called Worst Case Traffic allocation corresponding to the traffic descriptor parameters submitted by a VC: its peak cell rate, cell delay variation tolerance, sustainable cell rate, and intrinsic burst tolerance parameters, when applicable. We plan to investigate the practical application of these models to the problem of CAC; in particular, the important issues of accuracy of the available models, their range of validity and their complexity deserve more attention than they have received up to now. The present survey stands as a first step in that direction.

AB In this paper, we discuss past climatic trends over India, greenhouse gas emissions due to energy consumption, forest and land-use changes, climate change scenarios for the year 2050, potential consequences for agriculture and cyclone activity and the possibility that India might limit the increasing trend in its emissions.
   India's mean surface air temperature has increased significantly by about 0.4 degrees C over the past century. Neither monsoon nor annual rainfall shows any significant trend. On average, there has been a rise in sea levels around India over recent decades, though considerable uncertainties exist in the accuracy and interpretation of the available data.
   Carbon emissions from the energy sector amount to 71 MT a year, equivalent to all other sectors combined. From land-use data, a marginal net sequestration of 5.25 million tonnes of carbon occurred during 1986. Following the IPCC guidelines, methane emissions from rice and livestock are estimated at 17.4 and 12.8 Tg/year, respectively.
   According to recent climate model projections, India may experience a further rise in temperature of 1 degrees C by the year 2050, about four times the rate of warming experienced over the past 100 years. A modest increase in precipitation amounts might occur. Cereals production is estimated to decrease and the nutrition security of the population-rich but land-hungry region of India might be hampered. An increase in local tropical cyclone activity may occur over the next century, posing added problems as large areas in the coastal regions have a dense population.
   About 70% of the electricity generation in India is from coal-based power stations. Altering this dependence significantly to reduce emissions would imply a substantial change in the present energy policy of India. There is great potential for improving energy efficiency and conservation. The adoption of cleaner coal-technologies should be considered, as must the development of renewable, non-conventional energy sources. In all cases, serious institulional barriers and resource limitations need to be addressed. The scope for carbon sequestration is limiled by land availabilily and other factors. It is argued that any response to global warming must be located firmly in the framework of sustainable development.

AB Crop residues have been an under-valued resource in many agricultural systems. This collection of papers presents a sampling of new research and applications of new knowledge to improve our understanding of crop residue properties and impacts. Development and implementation of improved crop residue management offers opportunities to manipulate hydrologic, radiative, and energy balance processes. I hope the readers of Theoretical and Applied Climatology will be stimulated with new ideas. Collectively our new ideas can advance understanding of crop residue management and help us achieve sustainability in agricultural systems.

AB If the current trends in transport are not changed, a sustainable transport system is not feasible. In order to achieve such a state, new technologies may be an interesting option. In this paper, several success and failure factors for the introduction of new technologies are analyzed. These possibilities are identified in different areas, notably economic, spatial, institutional, social/psychological and technological fields. Within this context the following new options are discussed: the electric car, people movers, subterranean infrastructure, telematics, the high speed train, the high speed maglev train, shuttles in vacuum tunnels and alternative fuels. Finally, some policy choices, which may stimulate future technical developments, are discussed. It is concluded that an active government policy may stimulate the introduction of new technologies, which may make a substantial contribution to achieving a sustainable transport system.

AB Environmental problems have become urgent in many countries. A large contribution to the solution of environmental problems is expected from technological change. This raises the issue of how technological change takes place, and more in particular how technological change can be promoted that is beneficial to long term sustainability objectives.
   In the paper we discuss this topic in the context of the transport sector, This is relevant because transportation contributes significantly to various types of pollution, existing trends might lead to even more negative impacts and finally there are high expectations about the potential of future technological development to reduce the environmental impact of transportation.
   We approach the issue of technological change towards more environmentally sound development from the perspective of technology dynamics and sustainable development. We argue that additional theoretical insights are needed especially when one wants to study technological change in the context of environmental problems. We therefore discuss a strategy of cooperation between government and firms in network. Special attention is paid to the role of the government in networks and the use of a new type of instruments.

AB The Dutch National Institute of Public Health and Environmental Protection publishes Environmental Outlooks in which 25-year projections are made. These Outlooks quantifying the environmental problems, form the scientific basis for Dutch environmental policy. Traffic and transport is one of the main sectors causing environmental problems. The emissions and energy use of all relevant categories (road traffic, non-road traffic) are based on model simulations with models. This paper describes the main models used.
   If present policy is implemented only a minority of the environmental targets will be met.
   If a sustainable transport system for the Netherlands means a large reduction in CO2 emissions and energy use after 2010 a stronger emphasis on both technical and non-technical measures (such as land-use planning combined with public transport improvements) for the period until 2010 is needed than proposed in the Second Transport Structure Plan, unless a sustainable energy source becomes available.

AB Changes in issues and advances in methodology have contributed to substantial progress in tree physiology research during the last several decades. Current research focuses on process interactions in complex systems and the integration of processes across multiple spatial and temporal scales. An increasingly important challenge for future research is assuring sustainability of production systems and forested ecosystems in the face of increased demands for natural resources and human disturbance of forests. Meeting this challenge requires significant shifts in research approach, including the study of limitations of productivity that may accompany achievement of system sustainability, and a focus on the biological capabilities of complex land bases altered by human activity.

AB We derived a simplified version of a previously published process-based model of forest productivity and used it to gain information about the dependence of stemwood growth on nitrogen supply. The simplifications we made led to the following general expression for stemwood carbon (c(w)) as a function of stand age (t), which shows explicitly the main factors involved:
   [GRAPHICS]
   where eta(w) is the fraction of total carbon production (G) allocated to stemwood, G* is the equilibrium value of G at canopy closure, lambda describes the rate at which G approaches G*, and mu(w) is the combined specific rate of stemwood maintenance respiration and senescence. According to this equation, which describes a sigmoidal growth curve, c(w) is zero initially and asymptotically approaches eta(w)G*/mu(w) with the rate of approach dependent on lambda and mu(w). We used this result to derive corresponding expressions for the maximum mean annual stemwood volume increment (Y) and optimal rotation length (T). By calculating the quantities G* and lambda (which characterize the variation of carbon production with stand age) as functions of the supply rate of plant-available nitrogen (U-o), we estimated the responses of Y and T to changes in U-o. For a plausible set of parameter values, as U-o increased from 50 to 150 kg N ha(-1) year(-1), Y increased approximately linearly from 8 to 25 m(3) ha(-1) year(-1) (mainly as a result of increasing G*), whereas T decreased from 21 to 18 years (due to increasing lambda). The sensitivity of Y and T to other model parameters was also investigated. The analytical model provides a useful basis for examining the effects of changes in climate and nutrient supply on sustainable forest productivity, and may also help in interpreting the behavior of more complex process-based models of forest growth.

AB We used an existing analytical model of stemwood growth in relation to nitrogen supply, which we describe in an accompanying paper, to examine the long-term effects of harvesting and fire on tree growth. Our analysis takes into account the balance between nitrogen additions from deposition, fixation, and fertilizer applications, and nitrogen losses from stemwood harvesting, regeneration burning, leaching and gaseous emissions. Using a plausible set of parameter values for Eucalyptus, we conclude that nitrogen loss through fire is the main factor limiting sustainable yield, defined as the maximum mean annual stemwood volume increment obtained in the steady state, if management practices are continued indefinitely. The sustainable yield is 30 m(3) ha(-1) year(-1) with harvesting only, 15 m(3) ha(-1) year(-1) with harvesting and regeneration burning, and 13 m(3) ha(-1) year(-1) with harvesting, fire, leaching and gaseous emissions combined.
   Our approach uses a simple graphical analysis that provides a useful framework for examining the factors affecting sustainable yield. The graphical analysis is also useful for extending the application of the present model to the effects of climate change on sustainable yield, or for interpreting the behavior of other models of sustainable forest growth.

AB The purpose of this work was to test the hypothesis that reproducible and sustainable arterial occlusion can be induced by focused ultrasound energy deposition noninvasively within deep tissue, An MRI-compatible focused ultrasound transducer was used to sonicate a branch of the renal artery (diameter about 0.6 mm) in vivo (nine rabbits). An intravenous MRI contrast agent bolus was injected about 30 min and up to 7 days after the sonication, After follow-up, in vitro magnification x-ray angiograms were obtained and the kidneys were fixed in formaldehyde for histologic study, The ultrasound pulses resulted in complete cessation of blood flow, as shown by the gradient echo images, In seven of the nine rabbits, a wedge-shaped unenhanced area was seen at the part of the kidney that was perfused by the vessel after the contrast agent injection, This area extended laterally (outside of the sonicated volume) to the cortical surface of the kidney, The x-ray angiograms showed that the artery was completely occluded, Postmortem histologic evaluation showed an infarcted tissue volume corresponding to the wedge shape seen in the images, This study showed that appropriately focused ultrasound can be used to close arteries noninvasively. This finding has significant clinical potential. Copyright (C) 1996 World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine & Biology

TI Sustainable improvement of animal health care by systematic quality risk
   management according to the HACCP concept
SO VETERINARY QUARTERLY
LA English
DT Article
ID DAIRY
AB This paper addresses the principles of the Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) concept as applied to animal health management strategy. Characteristics of the concept were analysed and compared with those of current animal health care strategies for disease risk identification and herd health management, insurance, and certification. HACCP is a hybrid strategy of quality control at both production process and product level. Animal health is considered a particular quality feature. We show that process control (expressed in terms of controlling both general and specific disease risk factors) and product control (expressed in terms of testing animals or animal products for specific disease agents) could form the basis for improving animal health. We conclude that HACCP provides ample opportunity for preventive health action and risk management at a relatively low cost in terms of labour, finance and documentation expenditure, at both the farm and sector level. Epidemiological field studies are currently needed to identify critical control points and to design HACCP procedures for livestock producers. In the long run, HACCP based animal health care can be further developed into a quality control systems approach to cover all aspects that are related, either directly or indirectly, to animal health.

TI Life cycle assessment for waste management
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Standard methods for assessing the environmental impact of waste management systems are needed to underpin the development and implementation of sustainable waste management practices. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is an emerging tool for ensuring such assessment is comprehensive and covers the full ''cradle to grave'' impacts associated with providing a product or service. This paper discusses aspects of a recent study commissioned by the U.K. Department of the Environment to assess how LCA methodology could be developed and applied to assist decision makers in waste management. It focuses on a method developed by the research contractors for identifying the environmental burdens that occur during the collection, treatment and disposal of non-hazardous waste. The method requires waste management activities to be defined as generic unit operations which are independent of the specific characteristics of the waste processed. These unit operations are used to flowsheet the specific system under study and burdens that are independent of the waste are identified. Waste-dependent burdens are identified separately by considering the interaction of unit operations and the specific characteristics exhibited by the waste under study. For identification purposes a restricted list of 10 characteristics is considered sufficient to highlight those burdens for which inventory data may be required, Comment is made on the potential to develop the identification method to provide quantified data for the burden inventory.

TI Life cycle benefits of calcium silicate replacements
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB The most universal of all binders, produced in huge quantities worldwide, is Portland cement. Following introduction in 1824 by Joseph Aspin, it has quite properly enjoyed popular appear with craftsmen, architects and engineers for its bonding properties. The manufacture of cement relies largely on primary minerals for feedstock and depends heavily on carboniferous fuels for production. Naturally occurring minerals have similar properties as a binder and have been used in their own right or as partial replacements for cement. Likewise, secondary products recovered from modern manufacturing or energy production processes also have the potential to replace in part a proportion of cement. Life cycle analysis of cement production supports the proposition that large quantities of fossil fuel and primary minerals are being unnecessarily used in situations where alternative replacements are available and frequently placed to waste. This paper considers the implications of cement production on a sustainable environment. It argues that, contrary to some opinions, partial replacement of cement with secondary wastes which have potential cementitious properties can enhance and improve structures which otherwise would include only Portland cement as the binder. Acceptance of this argument would leave massive quantities of primary minerals untouched and reduce the amount of fossil fuels demanded of cement production on the present scale.

AB Deep Bay contains one of the most important wetlands in southern China It is located at the border of Hong Kong and the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone (SEZ). Over 50,000 birds rely on this wetland as a breeding, feeding, resting and refuelling station in winter. The Deep Bay catchment is also one of Asia's fastest developing areas. Its population has doubled since 1984. The rapid population increase and economic development have exerted considerable pressure on the wetland environment. Efforts have been made to reduce the pollution loads by both the Hong Kong and Shenzhen Governments to protect this ecologically important wetland. Through the implementation of a series of environmental programmes, including: sewerage master plans, the livestock waste control scheme, and enforcement of the Water Pollution Control Ordinance, the pollution loads arising from Hong Kong decreased from 125,000 to 45,000 kgBOD(5)/day between 1988 and 1994 and are expected to further reduce to around 3,000 kgBOD(5)/day by the year 2000. To protect the wetland community while promoting sustainable development in the catchment, Hong Kong initiated a study in 1995 to develop a mathematical model for the bay and a water quality management strategy for the future.

AB Sustained developments is the target of almost every modern water management policy. Sustainability is focused on human life and on the ecological quality of our environment. Both aspects are essential for life on earth. Within a river catchment area this means that well balanced relations have to be laid between human activities and ecological aspects in the involved areas. Policy analysis is especially looking for the most efficient way to analyse and to overcome bottlenecks.
   In The Netherlands project ''The Aquatic Outlook'' all these elements are worked out in a nationwide scale, providing the scientific base and policy analysis from which future water management plans can be derived. Copyright (C) 1996 IAWQ.

AB The Northwestern part of Overijssel in The Netherlands is an area where water management is characterised by various interrelated and often conflicting functions. To safeguard a sustainable use of water in this area, decisions have to be made. However, these decisions involve large amounts of complex and uncertain information. Using models and decision-methods, this information can be made available and understandable, in order to support decision-making and help water authorities to choose those measures that best meet the policy objectives. In this paper the usefulness of these models and decision methods, combined in an integrated decision support system, and the sensitivity of the decision support system, is discussed.

   state; Lake Sapanca
AB Lake Sapanca is the major water resource supplying drinking water as well as water for industrial and agricultural uses for one of the more industrialized areas of Turkey. Currently, the sustainability of its beneficial use is an issue of concern. Initially the water quality in the lake was classified according to the Turkish Regulations. With this conventional approach, a detailed water quality evaluation could not be achieved due to certain drawbacks, and this required the search for a new approach. Therefore, a more detailed classification was accomplished by taking German Technical Standards as a basis that would lead to more usable and understandable classification necessary to promote a rational management strategy. Both classifications dictate that classes 1 and 2 may be used for water supply effectively. The detailed classification indicates that at present water quality in the lake is overall of first class; however, it is tending towards Class 2, with the lake in a state of transition from oligotrophy to mesotrophy and the most critical issues being nutrient concentrations in the lake and land based nutrient sources.

AB Anthropogenic Nutrient Solution (ANS, Urine) adds about 75% of the nitrogen and 50% of the phosphorus to domestic wastewater. It is proposed to collect ANS at the source and release it sequentially, so that it arrives all at the same time at the treatment plant where it could be treated separately. The proposed system would have many advantages relative to the conventional technology. A stepwise transition from the conventional to the proposed technology would slowly improve system performance.

AB A general framework for the formulation and analysis of an overall decision support index is discussed. It is indicated that such an index allow evaluation of the combined effects of both design and operation (i) during the planning phase of new WWTPs, as well as (ii) for the evaluation of new operational strategies versus traditional expansions of plants already in operation. Attention is drawn to the problems of incorporating such factors as plant flexibility and robustness against failures in the index. These factors become especially relevant when decisions are to be made that affect the life span of a WWTP. Spatial and temporal separation of the optimisation problem are proposed to make the approach operational. It is not the intention of the authors to provide an exhaustive list of objective criterion functions, but rather to give the reader some examples illustrating the approach. Copyright (C) 1996 IAWQ.

AB The growing concerns of resource depletion and the consequential environmental degradation coupled with the ever widening gap between the developed and the developing countries has produced a need for a critical evaluation of waste management technologies. The conventional-criteria based definition of appropriate technologies is unsatisfactory. The principles of sustainability must be incorporated along with issues such as infrastructure capacity and the technology gap. It was concluded that a relevant technology based on holistic principles is more ''appropriate'' than one based on a set of criteria. Copyright (C) 1996 IAWQ. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB This paper reviews the way in which engineers interact with the environment. It argues that future engineering should be part of a paradigm shift in which engineers are seen as responsible stewards rather than negligent trustees of the environment. This can be accomplished by education in environmental ethics, defined here as a set of obligations to nature characterised by a mindset geared towards pollution prevention and pollution remediation. It is argued that training in environmental ethics should be considered as a fundamental skill taught in all engineering programmes. The paper closes with a suggested outline of a first course in environmental ethics. Copyright (C) 1996 IAWQ.

This technology consists of a pressurized bioreactor under 3 bar with an ultrafiltration unit for sludge retention coupled with a nanofiltration unit. The concentrate retained in the nanofiltration is fed back to the bioreactor resulting in an enhanced biodegradability and a better quality of the effluent. The flux through the ultrafiltration membrane ranged from 100 to 200 l/(m(3) h); that through the nanofiltration membrane was around 0.05 l/(m(3) h). While attaining a very high biomass concentration (20 to 40 kg MLVSS/m(3)) in the bioreactor the excess sludge production is remarkably small with 0.7 to 1.0% of the influent COD.

AB Australia is a relatively dry continent with an average runoff of 50 mm per year. The use of water resources in some river basins is approaching the limits of sustainability. Some adverse environmental impacts have been observed resulting from water diversions and from both reclaimed water and stormwater discharges. The paper describes current water recycling initiatives in Australia. These include: beneficial reuse of reclaimed water for urban, residential, industrial and agricultural purposes; recycling of greywater and stormwater; advanced treatment using membrane technology; and water efficient urban design. Some possible water recycling scenarios for Australia in the 21st century are examined. The implications of these scenarios are discussed. Copyright (C) 1996 IAWQ.

AB The actual and potential benefits of anaerobic wastewater treatment when implemented at the core of a sustainable and non-vulnerable environmental protection programme are described. The paper focuses on the anaerobic sludge bed (and in particular the expanded granular sludge bed (EGSB)) reactor concept. Start-up of these systems is shown to be rapid, within a few days with granular seed sludges, and they may be applied across a wide range of conditions and strengths of wastewater. EGSB systems are particularly suited to low temperatures (10 degrees C) and very low strengths (much less than<1000mg/l) and for the treatment of recalcitrant or toxic substrates.

DE policy; development; sustainability
AB The emergence of the concept of sustainable development in recent years has brought in the general realisation that societal perceptions must shift towards ecological determinism so as to achieve qualitative growth within the limits of the ecosystem's carrying capacity. The carrying capacity based planning process, innovative technologies for enhanced material and energy effectivity of production and consumption, structural economic change towards less resource-intensive sectors, and preventive environmental management through increasingly interventionist policies are some of the strategies for reconciling developmental goals with ecological. capabilities.
   The paper analyzes existing and future environmental issues emanating from developmental objectives and policies in population, agriculture and forestry, energy, industry and human settlement sectors in India and suggests an agenda for action, with focus on environmentally sound technology, to ensure discernible positive movement towards the overall aspirational goal of sustainable development.
   It argues for a dynamic policy framework for environmental management in which the time lag between problem awareness, technological solution and remedial action is minimized through anticipation and prevention of environmental problems that may arise as a consequence of decisions taken within various sectors of the economy; restoration of environmental quality wherever necessary; structural changes in the economy; and inter-policy coordination.

AB As a consequence of recent EU Directives and a substantial increase in the environmental awareness of the general public, practising engineers and researchers are now more than ever required to collaborate to provide the higher standards of water quality being demanded. The engineers role is to implement a cost effective, practical and sustainable solution; the researcher must provide the engineer with the tools and 'know how' to allow this solution to be attained.
   Recent research endeavours in the UK have resulted in a philosophy known as Urban Pollution Management. This philosophy allows the engineer to solve a drainage catchment problem utilising either simple or complex approaches, depending upon the ability of the receiving watercourse to assimilate discharges from CSOs and WTP's. The backbone of the complex approach is the sewer flow quality model. Consequently for a 'realistic' solution to be implemented, the sewer flow quality model must represent reality accurately. Work carried out in the City of Perth, has shown that there are significant limitations to the accuracy of a typical sewer now quality model; limitations which cannot be attributed to the mathematics or the limitations of the particular package, but are due to the complexity and diversity of the phenomena encountered within sewerage systems, particularly the effects of the sediments. This paper questions whether in fact the recent UK research endeavour has actually provided engineers with a tool/philosophy which can provide cost effective, practical and sustainable solutions to complex drainage catchment problems.

DE policy; legislation; river water; quality standards
AB From the middle ages until the early part of the nineteenth century the streets of European cities were foul with excrement and filth to the extent that aristocrats often held a clove-studded orange to their nostrils in order to tolerate the atmosphere. The introduction in about 1800 of water-carriage systems of sewage disposal. merely transferred the filth from the streets to the rivers. The problem was intensified in Britain by the coming of the Industrial Revolution and establishment of factories on the banks of the rivers where water was freely available for power, process manufacturing and the disposal of effluents. As a consequence the quality of most rivers deteriorated to the extent that they were unable to support fish life and in many cases were little more than open sewers. This was followed by a period of slow recovery, such that today most of these rivers have been cleaned with many having good fish stocks and some even supporting salmon.
   This recovery has not been easy nor has it been cheap. It has been based on the application of good engineering supported by the passing and enforcement of necessary legislation and the development of suitable institutional capacity to finance, design, construct, maintain and operate the required sewerage and sewage treatment systems. Such institutional and technical systems not only include the disposal of domestic sewage but also provisions for the treatment and disposal of industrial wastewaters and for the integrated management of river systems. Over the years a number of institutional arrangements and models have been tried, some successful others less so. Although there is no universally applicable approach to improving the aquatic environment, many of the experiences encountered by the so-called developed world can be learned by developing nations currently attempting to rectify their own aquatic pollution problems. Some of these lessons have already been discussed by the authors' including some dangers of copying standards from the developed world.
   The objective of this paper is to trace the steps taken over many years in the UK to develop methods and systems to protect and preserve the aquatic environment and from the lessons learned to highlight what is considered to be an appropriate and sustainable approach for industrialising nations. Such an approach involves setting of realistic and attainable standards, providing appropriate and affordable treatment to meet these standards, establishment of the necessary regulatory framework to ensure enforcement of the standards and provision of the necessary financial capabilities to guarantee successful and continued operation of treatment facilities.

AB The use of reclaimed wastewater for irrigation contributes to water conservation and, therefore, is an important component of a sound policy for water resources management in the Mediterranean region, With the exception of France and Germany, European Mediterranean countries have not established guidelines for the use of reclaimed wastewater for irrigation. The existence of such guidelines means an important step in the planning and implementation of safe use of reclaimed wastewater for irrigation, because it contributes to a sustainable development of landscape and agricultural irrigation. Guidelines for reclaimed wastewater use for irrigation must clearly define what is allowed and what is forbidden to execute. This can be defined in great detail or in a broad manner, but must take into account some important specific local conditions, such as the quality of reclaimed wastewater, soil, climate, relevant crops and agricultural practices, Consequently, experimentation means a key-support to establishing guidelines. The experience from a research project with different type of reclaimed wastewater, crops and irrigation methods carried out for several years in the climatic Mediterranean region of Portugal brings some contribution to the technical content of possible European guidelines, Other aspects to be included in the proposed guidelines, such as monitoring and institutional management are also presented.

AB Bench-scale soil column experiments were performed at The University of Arizona to examine the effects of soil type and infiltration rate on the removal of wastewater organics during soil aquifer treatment (SAT), The suitability of such waters for potable uses following a combination of above-ground treatments and SAT polishing was under investigation, SAT was simulated in 1-meter soil columns containing repacked homogenized soils ranging from poorly graded sands to silty sands. Soils were obtained from existing and potential effluent recharge sites in Arizona. All columns received chlorinated/dechlorinated secondary effluent, ponded to a 25-cm depth above the soil surface, under alternating wet/dry conditions. Treatment efficiencies in biologically active and inhibited columns were compared to determine the mechanism(s) of water quality improvements and the sustainability of SAT. Water quality parameters included: (i) non-purgable dissolved organic carbon and (ii) UV absorbance at 254 nm (used as a measure of disinfection-by-product precursors). Differences in through-column removal of non-purgable dissolved organic carbon were significant for columns containing sandy loam (56%), sand (48%) and silty sand (44%), Removal of UV-absorbing organics was not significantly different for columns containing sand and sandy loam (22 and 20%, respectively). There was no significant correlation between infiltration rate and removal efficiency of either organic parameter for both soils. Copyright (C) 1996 IAWQ. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Conventional control of two of New Zealand's principal vertebrate pests, the brushtail possum Trichosurus vulpecula and the European rabbit Oryctolagus cuniculus may not be sustainable on economic or social grounds. Biological control through the deliberate release of debilitating pathogens or vectored fertility control offers a potentially long-term, target-specific and humane option. However, the release of exotic pathogens, possibly genetically modified, into New Zealand raises major social and political concerns on both national and international levels which need to be weighed carefully against economic and conservation gains.

TI Revisited: The overstocking controversy in semi-arid Africa

AB It is widely believed that there is an optimum stocking rate for rangeland, that this rate will conserve range while maximizing profit, that estimating this rate is a technical matter and that the optimum applies to all types of livestock production, from fully commercial to totally subsistence systems. Despite these assumptions, policy-makers, development agencies and livestock and range scientists have persistently disagreed with African pastoralists over what the optimum rate is. This difference of opinion is commonly attributed to pastoral ignorance, and extension campaigns or administrative regulation are recommended. Africa's rangelands, the experts tell us, are overstocked and the residents of dry Africa should quickly learn, or de forced to adopt, some new habits.
   This series of three articles explores an alternative explanation. It argues that some technical observers have had a muddled idea of what constitutes overstocking, that existing stocking rates are often appropriate to pastoral management objectives and that these rates may be ecologically sustainable.
   Using experimental data from stocking rate trials for beef cattle, the first article in the series exposes the potential for confusion embedded in the concept of overgrazing. The article argues that there is unlikely to tie a single optimum stocking density, as different stocking targets are appropriate to different husbandry practices and objectives.
   The second article examines the characteristic management objectives and resource endowments of herders in semi-arid Africa. Traditional herders often choose to produce different outputs from those produced by commercial ranchers. Technical relationships between inputs and outputs commonly require higher stocking rates to maximize yields in African husbandry systems, which usually equal or exceed per hectare output from commercial ranchers in comparable natural environments.
   It may be profitable but environmentally unsustainable in the long term for traditional herders to stock heavily. The third article in the series addresses the issue of rangeland degradation. It presents a technique for estimating environmental costs, measured in terms of rates of soil loss or economically disadvantageous changes in rangeland vegetation, which result from different stocking densities.

AB After being excluded from world capital markets during the debt crisis, many developing countries have experienced large capital inflows during the east five years. The challenges that these inflows pose for domestic policy in recipient countries have generated a substantial literature. This article presents an overview of that literature, describing the characteristics of the new inflows, analyzing the policy issues they raise, assessing their causes and likely sustainability, and evaluating potential policy responses. The desirable policy response is tied to characteristics of the flows themselves as well as to the characteristics of the recipient economy.

AB The success (outreach and sustainability) of eight rural financial intermediation systems in Indonesia, in profitably reaching large numbers of small individual clients, is explained in terms of organizational design. Networks of semiautonomous units use local information and contract enforcement mechanisms to lower transaction costs. Reflecting basic concerns with institutional and financial viability, elements of mechanism design have included compatible incentives such as performance-based compensations (profit sharing, collection fees), efficiency wages (equivalent to quasi-equity), and system monitoring; managerial discretion over transactions conducted at market terms, policies to protect portfolio value, and no dependency-creating subsidies are important. Interventions have been appropriate for the problem at hand.

AB Marek's disease virus (MDV) is a highly infectious and cell-associated avian herpesvirus. Fully productive infections with MDV are restricted to feather follicle epithelium of afflicted birds. In culture, MDV infection of primary chick (CEF) and duck embryo fibroblast cells is semiproductive. Passage of MDV and production of MDV vaccines is limited to these primary cell-associated systems. The finite life span of primary avian cell cultures has hampered efforts to use positive selection in generation of recombinant MDV and complicates studies of temporal gene regulation. In this report, we describe continuous chick fibroblast cell lines (MDV OU2.2 and MDV OU2.1) which support MDV replication. Southern blot and PCR analyses demonstrate that these cell lines harbor MDV DNA. Western blot analyses indicate that MDV OU2.2 cells express at least a limited set of viral proteins, pp38 and pp14, similar to that seen in MDV-lymphoblastoid cells. Presence of distinct plaques in confluent MDV OU2.2 cell monolayers is consistent with cytolytic semiproductive infection, similar to that observed in primary CEF. MDV OU2.2 cells are capable of transferring MDV infection to primary CEF cultures and inducing clinical signs of Marek's disease in susceptible birds. MDV OU2.2 cells have maintained a MDV-positive phenotype for over 16 months of active culture. Southern blot hybridization of MDV OU2.2 cell DNA reveals a distinct expansion of the MDV BamHI H fragment in a subset of viral genomes following long-term cultivation. (C) 1995 Academic Press. inc.

TI A framework for establishing integrated reproductive health training
SO ADVANCES IN CONTRACEPTION
LA English
DT Article
AB The challenge for the next decade will be to make quality family planning services accessible to all sexually active couples who want them. The key to fulfilling this goal is the need to rapidly increase the availability of quality voluntary family planning services globally This paper presents a framework for integrated reproductive health training which provides a mechanism for ensuring a continuous sustainable supply of qualified trainers and service providers.
   The paper discusses the approach used by JHPIEGO, a Johns Hopkins University program for international education in reproductive health, to build up national training capacity through the development of integrated reproductive health training. This approach may be seen as a network of pathways linking the national system of higher education, the health care system, the political system and cultural norms to strengthen reproductive health policy, training and services. National integrated reproductive health training includes: updated national policies and service guidelines, pre-service training in health professional schools to prepare students to provide family planning services upon graduation; in-service training for practicing health professionals to improve family planning skills for immediate application on the job; and development of clinical training sites at service delivery points already providing family planning/reproductive health services.

TI STD/HIV prevention in Turkey: Planning a sequence of interventions
SO AIDS EDUCATION AND PREVENTION
LA English
DT Article
AB This study was initiated to assess which mix of early STD/HIV prevention interventions would potentially be effective, cost-effective and sustainable in Turkey; and to program an intervention sequence to maximize synergy among the interventions. During rapid assessment we: 1) reviewed past issues of 3 leading newspapers; 2) collected information on TV coverage; 3) interviewed key informants including taxicab drivers, hotel employees, grocery store owners, academicians in public health and law, investigators of STD/HIV and reproductive tract infections, and officials in the ministry of health; 4) reviewed available evidence on STD/HIV morbidity, sexual behavior patterns, migration patterns and same/opposite gender sex trade, We found: 1) discrepancies between decision makers' perceptions and social realities with respect to the epidemiology of sexual behavior and STDs, and the state of public health programs; 2) discrepancies between sexual practices and public expression regarding sexual practices; 3) economic, demographic, and political pressures in Turkey and in surrounding countries for the expansion of prostitution; 4) a sexual double standard and gender specific migration patterns which sustain a high demand for commercial sex; 5) patterns of health care seeking behaviors and provision of STD clinical services which indicate other STDs may play a very important role in spread of HIV infection; 6) an important mass media role in opinion formation; 7) consensual denial of risk for the majority based on beliefs embedded in machismo, nationalism and religion, and a resulting marginalization and externalization of STD/HIV risk; 8) high prevalence of syphilis among both Turkish and immigrant female prostitutes in Istanbul (early latent 8 and 13%; late latent 0 and 4%; previous history 9 and 22%) 9) and high rates of syphilis among male prostitutes (early latent 11%, late latent 21% and previous history 58%). We concluded that interventions should initially include, in the following order; 1) awareness raising for decision makers and opinion leaders including members of parliament and mass media; 2) awareness raising for members of the general population; 3) needs assessment and intervention development for sex workers; 4) training in HIV and other STDs for medical personnel; and 5) quality assurance and control for laboratory procedures for STDs/HIV.

TI Environmental impact of prawn farming on Dutch Canal: The main water
   source for the prawn culture industry in Sri Lanka
SO AMBIO
LA English
DT Article
AB Expansion in the prawn-culture industry in Sri Lanka is being increasingly constrained by problems related to environ-mental degradation. The present study was undertaken during 1993 and 1994, and examined the water quality of the main water source for the prawn-farming industry in northwestern Sri Lanka, as well the effluents in selected farm sites located in the same area, i.e. Dutch Canal. Prawn farms in the intertidal and supratidal areas of Dutch Canal operate at two levels on a semi-intensive scale. Among the water-quality parameters monitored in farm effluents, significant differences were only observed for sulfides, nitrites and ammonia. The effluents discharged to the Dutch Canal from prawn farms contained relatively high concentrations of sulfides, nitrites and ammonia with mean concentrations of 0.50 mg L(-1), 0.12 mg L(-1), and 0.45 mg L(-1), respectively. Examination of the water body receiving these effluents (Dutch Canal) showed that nitrates, ammonia, sulfides and total suspended solids were at suboptimal levels for prawn cultivation purposes. It is proposed that complimentary treatment systems be established to improve the quality of the receiving water and the farm effluents so as to minimize the environmental impact of the prawn culture industry, and to provide for the sustainability of future prawn cultivation.

TI Marine resource use and the establishment of a marine park: Mafia
   Island, Tanzania
SO AMBIO
LA English
DT Article
ID BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION
AB The involvement and participation of indigenous marine resource users in the planning and management of marine conservation areas has received considerable attention in recent years. Although various projects have considered this aspect there has been little in situ study of how indigenous practices can affect a conservation area, and it has been seen that many conservation projects have largely failed because of a lack of understanding as to how the indigenous resource users relate to the environment socioeconomically. The present study examines such interrelations for the coastal communities within the newly established Mafia Island Marine Park in Tanzania. From an extensive survey of the marine resource users in the area it was possible to identify and quantify the prevailing resource-usage patterns as well as to examine the perception and expectations of the various communities with regard to the marine park and conservation issues. The study also demonstrated that local involvement can be of great value in finding viable solutions with regard to issues such as economic incentives, alternatives to destructive activities, education and compensation. In addition, it was found that different forms of compensation could be a cost efficient and sustainable means of enforcing regulations, but on the condition that it was appropriate and that it stemmed from direct involvement of the indigenous resource users.

TI Perception and reality: Assessing priorities for sustainable development
   in the Niger River Delta
SO AMBIO
LA English
DT Article
AB The Niger Delta is the richest part of Nigeria in terms of natural resources, The area has large oil and gas deposits, as well as extensive forests, good agricultural land and abundant fish resources. Despite the tremendous natural and human resource base, the region's potential for sustainable development remains unfulfilled and its future is being threatened by environmental degradation and deteriorating economic conditions which are not being addressed by present policies and actions. Twenty-five years of oil development have not brought significant benefits to the region. Resource-use decisions are being driven by a lack of development, poor health, stagnant agricultural productivity, very limited opportunities in urban areas, rapid population growth, and tenuous property rights. The article attempts to advance beyond the prevailing emotive arguments on the causes of environmental degradation by examining the full range of environmental issues to determine priorities and to suggest options for sustainable development within an integrated coastal zone management framework.

AB Allelopathy is the direct influence of a chemical released from one living plant on the development and growth of another plant. The use of allelopathy to control weeds of food crops could contribute towards increasing yields in sustainable agricultural systems. Various research teams have identified several hundred rice accessions which show indications of allelopathic potential, 60 of them showing promising allelopathic activity against one or more weeds. These accessions have different origin and stage of improvement. This, combined with the involvement of several allelochemicals and the ability to release these chemicals, indicates that allelopathic potential is a polygenic characteristic weakly correlated with yield or other important agronomic features. Successful allelopathy research, however, must be focused both on the discovery and subsequent validation of allelopathic potential. Experimental factors such as choice of test plants, collection of allelochemicals, concentration, osmotic pressure and bioassay methodology need considerable attention together with validation through assays with known chemicals of known concentrations. Without validation using known chemicals, the contribution of allelopathic research remains obscure. Several putative allelochemicals are found in extracts of rice leaf and straw, decomposing straw, and in rice soil. Evidence that these chemicals are being released from living plants is still lacking, but as it is a prerequisite for allelopathic activity in nature, it must be proved. Methods of collecting test solutions from living plants need further description. Allelopathic activity is believed to be a joint action of several secondary metabolites, and this must be confirmed for rice. Dilution assays with mixtures of putative rice allelochemicals need to be conducted to evaluate possible synergistic effects. In validation, these mixture-dose response curves must be compared with assays using collected test solutions. A joint, coordinated and focused research effort on rice allelopathy is necessary before the full potential of allelopathic cultivars can be realised.

AB The semi-arid regions of Iran are under increasing pressure to supply the staple grains required by the steadily growing population. The Hamadan plateau, an ancient area at the foot of the Central Zagros mountain (354 m asl at the Alwand peak), was chosen to carry out an analysis of the agricultural systems (traditional vs modem) and to assess their sustainability. Several indicators from the ecosystem and sociosystem were implemented to compare the two systems. Like many other places in Iran, also in the Hamadan region agriculture is undergoing a fast change from subsistenance to an advanced level. The resulted changes in social structure, which caused the disruption of the co-evolutionary equilibrium reached over long time by the traditional systems, are analysed.

TI BUBBLE FINANCE AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY - A TEST OF THE GOVERNMENTS
   INTERTEMPORAL BUDGET CONSTRAINT
SO APPLIED ECONOMICS
LA English
DT Article

AB This paper tests whether the government's budget is intertemporally balanced in a number of EC countries by applying a method first developed to detect speculative bubbles in financial markets. The test aims to establish whether the government can engage in bubble finance, and is based on a comparison between two sets of estimates. The first is obtained directly by regressing the stock of outstanding debt on a distributed lag of the primary surplus. The second is obtained indirectly from a pair of equations, one relating the current debt stock to next period's primary surplus and debt stock, the other specifying an AR process for the primary surplus. In the presence of a bubble, only the first set of estimates is inconsistent, and hence the two sets differ. It is found that the null of no bubble can be rejected in the cases of Italy, Germany, Denmark and Greece implying that the government is not intertemporally solvent in these countries. The other EC member states appear to be on a sustainable path.

AB Soil samples were collected to a depth of 10 cm in 1991 and 1993 in a vegetable crop rotation experiment initiated in 1989. The two cropping treatments (under either 0 or 280 kg N ha(-1)), were the traditional vegetable rotation (TVR) currently being practiced and an alternative rotation (LVR) in which a vegetable crop alternated with a legume, red clover (Trifolium pratense L.), that was incorporated as green manure the following spring. Chemical and microbiological parameters were determined on whole soil and five soil aggregate size fractions: 1.00-2.00, 0.50-1.00, 0.25-0.50, 0.10-0.25, and less than 0.1 mm. Within a 2 year period, there was a major shift in the natural fabric aggregate size distribution in the LVR with a 35% decrease in microaggregates ( < 0.25 mm) and a similar percentage increase in macroaggregates ( > 0.25 mm). On the whole soil, the shift was accompanied by large increases in the microbial biomass to soil C ratio (C-mic:C-org) and microbial biomass (C-mic). Furthermore, labile organic matter pools (particulate organic matter and dissolved organic C) were significantly (P < 0.05) higher in the LVR than TVR soils in both sampling years. Large aggregates had a high C-mic, C-mic:C-org and low qCO(2) (mg CO2-C mg(-1) C-mic). There was a negative correlation (r = 0.713***) between qCO(2) and aggregate size, and a positive correlation of C-mic or C-mic:C-org with aggregate size (r = 0.76*** and r = 0.74** respectively). Nitrogen fertilization caused a general increase in qCO(2), CO2-C and C-mic. The results documented a significant improvement of soil aggregation and maintenance of organic C pools with a soil management system that provides greater root activity and C input. Further, the results indicated that there was a qualitative difference in microbial communities between macroaggregates and microaggregates.

TI SWAMP: A knowledge-based system for the dissemination of sustainable
   development expertise to the developing world
SO AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
AB 1. Population and economic pressures necessitate the development of productive yet fragile wetland areas in some tropical developing countries. Owing largely to these same social and economic pressures, expertise for the design and implementation of sustainable development strategies is often limited in developing countries.
   2. Considerable relevant knowledge and experience exist in Europe and North America. Resource constraints limit the availability of this expertise in areas of need in the developing world, despite various international commitments to such cooperation.
   3. Knowledge-based systems technology is well suited for the transfer of expertise from specialists to non-specialist users. It may therefore represent a cost-effective solution for developed nations to honour their commitments to assist developing nations.
   4. SWAMP (Sustainable Wetland Areas Management Project) has been developed to support the National Wetlands Conservation and Management Programme in Uganda. Its purpose is to select appropriate combinations of sustainable uses for wetlands which may be under pressure for development to supply food, tradeable products, or other resources.
   5. SWAMP has the capability to be extended to tropical wetlands in general. in principle, SWAMP's architecture is equally applicable for supporting similar sustainable development initiatives in other types of ecosystem.

TI Coastal groups, littoral cells, policies and plans in the UK
SO AREA
LA English
DT Article
AB Major changes in attitude and in procedures relating to physical management of the coast have taken place over the last decade in the UK. These changes have been prompted by increasing problems of sediment depletion on beaches and evidence that conventional engineering solutions may themselves have detrimental effects. Pressure for changes in techniques and organisation of management has been further stimulated by predictions of the possible effects of global warming and questions of the long-term sustainability of a strategy of protection. The changes in attitude and procedure have involved an increased awareness amongst decision-makers of the benefits and value of a more integrated approach to coastal management and a realisation of the need to use wide spatial perspectives. A growing appreciation of the needs to manage whole coastal landforms and landscapes is beginning to supersede traditional site-specific structural engineering approaches. This is an approach long advocated by geographers and geomorphologists (Bowen and Inman 1966; Brunsden and Thornes 1979; Hooke 1988) but nom being applied at a strategic level. The geographical community needs to be aware of these developments and the associated opportunities in this rapidly expanding field. This paper reports on progress so far and explains, from direct experience, how one of the most important developments, formation of 'coastal groups', has operated. The group described also provides an interesting example of interaction amongst elected and appointed decision-makers and the nature of influences upon them.

TI Sustainable development and the role of land use planning
SO AREA
LA English
DT Article
AB Many interests concerned with the British land use planning system have welcomed the adoption of a goal of sustainable development and sought to argue that planners have a specific role to play in achieving this goal. Such an attempt to restate a strategic function for the planning system raises questions about the ability of the system to deliver and the vested interests of professional planners. It is argued that neither of the alternative models of the planning system-as a mediator of conflicts or as a basis of empowerment-resolve fundamental problems involved in using land use planning to achieve sustainability and that, therefore, this goal continues to depend on broader emancipatory politics.

Borrowed funds have generally financed productive investments, contributing to rapid growth in GDP and exports since the late 1980s. If recent trends continue, debt should ease gradually; if not, the economy could withstand a substantial balance of payments shock, at least for a while. A debt servicing problem, although unlikely, is conceivable by the end of the decade. Short-term debt is growing rapidly, non-oil export growth has slowed, and debt service remains high. Appropriate government actions to reduce the potential for a crisis include further deregulation to support growth in non-oil exports, discouraging implicit government guarantees for private sector projects, and reducing government exposure to yen-denominated debt.

TI International trade in nutmeg and mace: Issues and options for Indonesia
SO BULLETIN OF INDONESIAN ECONOMIC STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
ID TAXES
AB Indonesia produces more than three-quarters of the world's output of nutmeg and mace. In 1986 the government introduced export regulations that facilitated cartelisation of the market. This led to a dramatic rise in world prices. Problems such as accumulation of unsold stocks in Indonesia and smuggling of nutmeg and mace through Singapore led the government to abolish the regulations in 1990. World prices fell steeply, and since then have remained low. Indonesian nutmeg and mace exporters have called for the reregulation of the market. This paper assesses the case for reregulation, considering the costs and benefits to affected parties within Indonesia and the long-term sustainability of regulation.

AB Analysis of estimates of population size of ringed seals (Phoca hispida) and polar bears (Ursus maritimus) from several areas indicated that estimates of one predicted the range of expected population size of the other in areas where ringed seals constitute the primary prey. In some areas, the closeness of this relationship indicates where estimates of either seals or bears may be inaccurate. The number of seals required to support a population of polar bears of predetermined size was estimated independently using both behavioral and energetic data. Behavioral estimates of the number of seals killed may overestimate energetic requirements and vice versa. Predation and energy matrices indicated that high levels of predation on seals are sustainable only if most animals killed are young-of-the-year, The field metabolic rate of the polar bear appears to be about twice the basal metabolic rate. Densities of seals vary in response to overall productivity of the ecosystem in different areas, and fluctuations in their numbers and reproductive rates between years can be used to monitor changes in productivity of the ecosystem. These changes also cause variation in productivity of bears, which indicates the sensitivity, at the population level, of the relationship between ringed seals and polar bears.

ID ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION; SUSTAINABLE BIOSPHERE; BIODIVERSITY; AMERICA
AB Both natural and anthropogenic factors are important in determining a species' risk of extinction. Little work has been done however, to quantify the magnitude of current anthropogenic influences on the extinction process. The purpose of this study is to determine the extent to which measures of the the intensity of human activity are related to the global variability of two measures of species' susceptibility to extinction. We observed size indices of human activities in 90 countries, and we tested their relationships to the proportion of threatened bird and mammal species in each country, as well as to mammalian population density. After correcting for area effects, latitudinal diversity gradients, and body size (for population density), 28 to 50% of the remaining variation was statistically attributable to anthropogenic variables. Different measures of anthropogenic influence were most closely related to extinction risk in birds and mammals. Human population density was the variable most closely related to the proportion of threatened bird species per country, whereas per capita GNP was more important for mammal species. Mammalian population density strongly correlates with the extent of protected area per country. Contrary to suggestions in earlier literature, our work does not support the hypothesis that habitat loss is a prime contributor to species loss because frequencies of threatened birds and mammals are not closely related to patterns of land use.

ID CONSERVATION
AB Public understanding of general environment- and population-related issues is critical for successful conservation efforts. We interviewed 300 residents of Costa Rica, distributed among three socioeconomic groups, to survey knowledge and perceptions about the environment. We focused on Costa Rica because it is an international model for sustainable development and because of its direct economic interest in biodiversity preservation for ecotourism. Our results indicate that Costa Ricans generally have a limited awareness of environment- and population-related problems. In all socioeconomic groups environmental problems were considered less important than various other problems, but 91% of respondents indicated a willingness to pay more for water or electricity if the extra money were used to protect biodiversity. Residents of San Jose's lower-class neighborhoods more strongly perceived the effects of population growth and environmental degradation than did residents of urban, upper-class, or rural neighborhoods. Of those interviewed 69% thought the rate of population growth should decrease. Only 52% of those surveyed, however, perceived any link between population size or growth rate and environmental quality; of those, 33% could not describe the link. Our findings and others suggest a number of ways to enhance the effectiveness of environmental education programs worldwide. (1) include information on the relationship between population and environmental quality; (2) explain the socioeconomic implications of environmental degradation; (3) in addition to formal education, utilize the mass media more (4) tailor messages to local circumstances.

AB The self-organizing principles of markets that have emerged in human cultures over the past 10 000 years are inherently in conflict with the self-organizing principles of ecosystems that have evolved over the past 3.5 billion years. The rules governing the dynamics of ecosystems, within which all human activity takes place, are ultimately a function of biological laws, not a function of human-created economic systems. The conflict between these systems is illustrated by the fact that economic indicators have shown vigorous growth during the last century while a variety of environmental indicators have exhibited negative trends. Ultimately, however, the growth of human economies faces the constraints that limit all biological systems. In this article we outline the bases for the conflict between biological and economic activity and suggest policy approaches that will enhance the chances for creating cultures that are economically and environmentally sustainable.

DE sustainability
ID UNCERTAINTY
AB This paper attempts to separate the definition of sustainability (which is argued to be quite straightforward) from related issues concerning: (1) which system, subsystem, or characteristics are to be sustained; (2) for how long they are to be sustained; and (3) when we can assess whether the system has actually been sustained. We argue that because we can only assess sustainability after the fact, it is a prediction problem more than a definition problem. We also propose that in order for evolutionary adaptation to occur, there must be an ordered, hierarchical relationship between the expected (finite) life spans of systems and their space and time scales.

   biodiversity; solar equivalent energy
AB By means of a systemic analysis of the relationships among components of an ecosystem's web, the flows of energy and other resources converging to produce the output (biomass, biodiversity, assets, etc.) can be evaluated on a common basis, i.e. the content of solar equivalent energy (emergy). Indices and ratios based on the emergy flows can be calculated and used to evaluate the behaviour of the whole system. In this paper, one of these indices, the emergy yield ratio eta (total yield emergy per unit of emergy invested) is evaluated and suggestions made to modify it to account for present and future environmental damages due to the use of a given resource. The meaning of this index, with and without the proposed modification, is stressed illustrating the long-term effects of environmental pollution as well as some key uncertainty factors that are very often not taken into account.

ID AUSTRALIA
AB Figures commonly quoted on costs of generating energy from renewable sources can give the impression that it will be possible to switch to renewables as the foundation for the continuation of industrial societies with high material living standards. Although renewable energy must be the sole source in a sustainable society, major difficulties become evident when conversions, storage and supply for high latitudes are considered. It is concluded that renewable energy sources will not be able to sustain present rich world levels of energy use and that a sustainable world order must be based on acceptance of much lower per capita levels of energy use, much lower living standards and a zero growth economy.

AB The purpose of this paper is to examine the role of biomass energy in the federal government policies of Canada, Mexico and the USA on the development and utilization of biomass energy. These policies span the entire spectrum from poor to excellent. One of the main driving forces displacing fossil fuels today is environmental issues. But there are still major barriers that are affected by government policies and that must be overcome to facilitate the displacement of large amounts of fossil fuels by biomass. Among these are development of large-scale systems that can supply sustainable amounts of biomass energy and biofuels at competitive prices, and nationwide distribution systems that simplify consumer access. These and other barriers must ultimately be addressed if any federal government decides to institute policies to help establish large-scale biomass energy markets. Otherwise biomass energy utilization will continue to rely on government subsidies and will be limited to niche markets for many years until oil depletion and supply disruptions become a fact of life. This indeed may turn out to be the third oil shock in the 21st century.

TI Banking responsibility and Liability for the environment: What are banks
   doing?
SO ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION
LA English
DT Article
AB No-strings-attached lending is anathema to the serious commercial banker, who sees only a wafer-thin line between such 'lending' and the un-bank-like practice of giving (non-returnable) grants. Such doubts, indeed, are not confined to the banking industry. In the face of home grown problems of unemployment or health-care, for instance, democratically elected governments of donor countries are finding themselves under increasing pressure from their voters to cut back on bilateral assistance to hopelessly indebted taker-states. Multilateral lending and development institutions are facing an uncertain future, trapped in the vicious circle of bad debts that are all-too-steadily increasing, capital and funding quotas that are failing to materialize (eyes are currently on the US Congress), and borrowing that is becoming ever-more expensive. The African Development Bank is faltering; a Middle East Development Bank is in danger of being stillborn. The World Bank has recently been trying bravely to redress the balance: it has created a 'multilateral debt facility' for the most severely-indebted countries, and devised a numerical scale of national well-being that is more appropriate for the measurement of ecologically sustainable development than GNP per head of population. While these initiatives should not be belittled, good ideas are too often murdered by gangs of ugly facts.
   Three years ago, at UNCED in Rio, great divides very quickly became evident: north v. south; givers v. takers; even environment v. development. Whenever funding was discussed, another gap appeared: How much? v. How on earth? And while astronomical figures were produced in response to the former question, the latter - to this day has not been satifactorily answered. True, percentages of GNPs were 'pledged' at the time by developed countries, and GEF was touted as the answer to the developing world's prayers. But it was not to be. And why not? One of the reasons, the present writer argues, was that a key fraternity in the world's business community did not take part in the planning process.
   International bank lending is now measured in US trillions (millions of millions) of dollars, and the global capital market in tens of such trillions. Central banks, commercial banks, and even private banks, world-wide, have a part to play in the development of every single financial transaction that services this huge sector. Banks - at any rate in the developed world - are now learning that they can, and indeed must, become involved in thee conservation of The Biosphere on one hand*, and in the furthering of the development process on the other.
   Internal studies, leading, for example, to energy-saving, are being translated into advice for customers; EIAs, in line with local environmental requirements, are being created, with a view to their eventually becoming a sine qua non in all lending and investment operations. Banks are cutting their way through the thickets of environmental law as applied, for example, to the situation in which they suddenly become unwilling possessors (by way of mort gage) of polluted real estate. Most exciting, perhaps, is the vision that, after assembling a sufficient store of knowledge on the subject, local banks in developing countries will be prepared and able to take over the role of multilateral institutions in financing innovative development projects in their own environments. This paper is a measure of the progress in this direction which banks have made to date.
   'How can you say the poor are not credit-worthy?' was a rhetorical question recently posed by Mr Muhammad Yunus, founder of the Grameen Bank, which is acknowledged as the world's leader in 'micro-lending' (to the least-privileged families of one the world's poorest countries, Bangladesh). 'The basic question', he ventured, 'is whether banks and credit institutions are people-worthy'.

TI Conversion of coastal habitats in Singapore: Indications of
   unsustainable development
SO ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION
LA English
DT Article
AB The Republic of Singapore, a small island state lying at the southern extremity of Peninsular Malaysia has, along with other ASEAN nations, stated its commitment to the principle of 'sustainable development' and ecological sustainability. This paper presents an assessment of the impact of post-World War II development on the extent and quality of intertidal coastal ecosystems and ecocomplexes in Singapore - specifically on coral reefs, mangroves, and intertidal sand- and mud-flats - and hence an evaluation of Singapore's commitment to maintaining coastal ecosystems and coastal biodiversity. The extent of these habitats was mapped from topographic and hydrographic maps, and estimates of their future area was derived from the Singapore Concept Plan for the year 'x' (AD c. 2030).
   In 1953 Singapore contained totals of 63.34 km(2) of mangroves, 30.47 km(2) of intertidal coral-reef flats, and 32.75 km(2) of intertidal sand- and mud-areas. By 1993, only 6.5% of the mangrove, 24.0% of the intertidal coral-reed, remained. The principal post-World War II impacts on these habitats are attributed to 'reclamation' of areas for other purposes and increased turbidity of coastal waters, and these causes of stress are continuing. The Government of Singapore's primary initiative in coastal conservation, the Singapore Green Plan, will not halt the trend of coastal ecological destruction, and it is projected that by AD 2030 only 4.20% of the mangrove, 12.18% of the intertidal sediments, and 22.16% of the intertidal coral-reef habitat that was present in 1922 will remain - mostly in a degraded and fragmented condition.
   Several misconceptions hinder the adoption of strategies that might facilitate ecological sustainability, including the beliefs that Singapore has no natural resources, that Singapore is constrained in introducing more imaginative development strategies by its small land-area, that environmental management equals pollution control, and that ecological destruction was and is inevitable. Accordingly, Singapore's present approach to resource management is far from being consistent with its stated commitment to the protection of biodiversity and to ecologically sustainable development.

TI Constraints and opportunities in planning for the wise use of natural
   resources in developing countries: Example of a hydropower project
SO ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION
LA English
DT Article
AB The impacts of hydropower developments on local environment, ecology, and socio-economics, has influenced, and will continue to influence, the efficacy in decision making and planning/design processes. Big dams have several disadvantages: (a) high costs, (b) possible collapse, (c) evaporation loss, (d) flooding of prime agricultural land, (e) siltation of reservoir, (f) salt-water intrusion in coastal areas, (g) deforestation and 'greenhouse' effect, and (h) destruction of habitat for rare species. We must refine our environmental understanding of how hydropower development affects species, both individually and in their interactions with each other. The utter dependence of organisms on appropriate environments is what frustrates most attempts to proceed with development and still protect ecosystems and wider ecocomplexes. Conservation objectives must be integrated with other objectives in formulating national and other policies, before they crystallize into projects and programmes. When ecological factors are considered only at the end of the process, they are liable to be viewed as obstructing development, which can be disastrously wrong. But if integrated at the basic level of decision-making, they can positively guide development most propitiously and beneficially. Translated to the global context, this is best served by holistic thinking.
   Developing countries face severe challenges in dealing with planning, conservation, and wise use of resources. The stimulus given by hydropower developments to ecological and limnological research can provide a valuable infrastructure which can be used to promote future effective multi-objective environmental evaluation, especially in truly developing countries. Multi-objective planning must also include sociological impacts for sufficient understanding for innovative treatment of the complex interrelationships between the components of the environment. Environmentally well-designed, and meticulously carried out, integrated research should play a fundamental role as the basis of deciding for the future the renewable and sustainable needs and wise use of our often limited resources.

ID GROWTH
AB This paper considers an economy in which the environment plays a role both in welfare and production. An endogenous growth model, which allows for abatement activities, is formulated in order to study the impact of pollution on welfare and long-term growth. Conditions for optimal and balanced economic growth are discussed and a numerical example is given to provide some insight in the mechanisms at work in the model.

AB While the steady stare is often seen as the final result of development in nature, a more realistic concept may be that nature pulses regularly to make a pulsing steady state-a new paradigm gaining acceptance in ecology and many other fields. In this paper we compare tidal salt marshes, tidal freshwater marshes, and seasonally flooded freshwater wetlands as examples of pulsed ecosystems. Despite marked differences in species composition, biodiversity, and community structure, these wetland types are functionally similar because of the common denominator of water flow pulses. Often a period of high production alternates with a period of rapid consumption in these fluctuating water-level systems, a biotic pulsing to which many life histories, such as that of the wood stork, are adapted. Pulsing of medium frequency and amplitude often provides an energy subsidy for the community thus enhancing its productivity. The energy of large-scale pulses such as storms are usually dissipated in natural ecosystems with little harm to the biotic network; however, when seawalls, dikes, or stabilized sand dunes are constructed to confront these strong pulses, the whole ecosystem (and associated human structures) may be severly damaged when the barriers fail because too much of the storm energy is concentrated on them. The relationship between biologically mediated internal pulsing, such as plant-herbivore or predator-prey cycles, and physical external pulsing is discussed not only in wetlands but in other ecosystem types as well. An intriguing hypothesis is that ecosystem performance and species survival are enhanced when external and internal pulses are coupled. We suggest that if pulsing is general, then what is sustainable in ecosystems, is a repeating oscillation that is often poised on the edge of chaos.

AB In deltas, subsidence leads to a relative sea-level rise (RSLR) that is often much greater than eustatic rise alone. Because of high RSLR, deltaic wetlands will be affected early by an acceleration of eustatic sea-level rise. If there is sufficient vertical accretion, wetlands can continue to exist with RSLR; however, lack of sediment input eventually leads to excessive water logging and plant death. Areas with low tidal range, such as the Mediterranean and Gulf of Mexico, are especially vulnerable to rising water levels because the elevational growth rang of coastal vegetation is related to tide range. Reduction of suspended sediments in rivers and prevention of wetland flooding by river dikes and impoundments have reduced sediment input to Mediterranean and Gulf of Mexico deltaic wetlands. This sediment deficit will become more important with an acceleration in sea-level rise from global warming. Most sediment input occurs during strong pulsing events such as river floods and storms, and management policies and decisions are especially designed to protect against such events. Management approaches must be reoriented to take advantage of pulsing events to nourish marsh surfaces with sediments. We hypothesize that deltas can be managed to withstand significant rates of sea-level rise by taking advantage of pulsing events leading to high sediment input, and that this type of management approach will enhance ecosystem functioning.

TI ENERGY INEQUITIES WITHIN DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES - AN IMPORTANT CONCERN IN
   THE GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL-CHANGE DEBATE
SO GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS
LA English
DT Article
AB A major theme of development during the half century since the end of World War II has been that of closing the affluence gap between the richer and poorer countries of the world. It is thus not surprising that a principal focus of the worldwide discussions on global environmental change during the past decade has been the issue of equity between countries, The evolving concept of sustainable development has drawn attention to the need of maintaining some equity between generations, In contrast, there has been relatively little attention paid to issues of equity within countries, In many parts of the world, the disparities within countries are as large as those between the developing and the industrialized countries, and these inequities need to be addressed much more explicitly than has been the case so far, In this paper, differences in energy use in South Asia between the low income and middle class households for cooking, transportation, and electricity, are used as illustrations of the disparities within countries, These have implications in terms of the impact of each group on the global environment, as well as on the local environment.

TI Sustainability in the health sector: The research study
SO HEALTH POLICY AND PLANNING
LA English
DT Article
AB Why has investment in health in some developing countries failed to result in a sustained capacity to deliver basic health care? This paper presents an overview of the sustainability problem. It is based on Save the Children Fund's (SCF) global research on sustainability in the health sector carried out from 1991 to 1993 in five countries: Uganda, Nepal, Pakistan, Ghana and Vietnam. Sustainability is defined as the capacity of the health system to function effectively over time with minimum external input. Following a discussion of the concept of sustainability and its emergence as a popular policy issue, the paper offers a framework for analyzing health system sustainability and considers the concept's relevance to major investors in health in low-income countries.

TI Donor and government constraints to sustainability in Nepal
SO HEALTH POLICY AND PLANNING
LA English
DT Article
AB From interviews, visits and a review of available information on the health sector in Nepal, the main issues related to sustainability were identified as: the absolute level of resources available for health system investment; coordination; centralized planning, decision-making and target-setting; emphasis on projects rather than sectoral development; the relationship between planning and budgeting; the tokenism of consultation between external agencies and government; health manpower training, deployment and remuneration; the uncoordinated proliferation of NGO service delivery; and the management of available funding and resources.
   As observed during this study, donors' operational behaviour negatively affects sustainability. These practices include a tendency to work in a vertical fashion without sufficient coordination with others working in the same area, reliance on central level planners rather than consulting widely throughout the health system, demands for project-specific targets and accountability, impatience with slow government approval procedures, and lack of concern for long-term recurrent costs and related implications of externally-funded projects. The government shares some of these operational shortcomings but introduces additional constraints to sustainability. Political concerns were found to take precedence over established plans, budgetary allocations to health are extremely limited, and health manpower is not developed in a manner which builds and sustains capacity to provide good quality services and manage resources effectively.
   If donors truly wish to foster the development of a sustainable health care system in Nepal, they must modify their planning approaches to be more sensitive to government needs and processes. External agencies must also accept that the majority of their investments will not be financially sustainable for quite a long time, and provide long-term, consistent and reliable recurrent-cost funding which supports basic health activities in general. By the same token, government must be more realistic about its technical, logistical and financial capabilities when accepting assistance. All sectors of government (i.e. politicians as well as planners and technical staff) must respect established priorities and accept and use assistance in a more rational and less self-interested manner.

TI Looking a gift horse in the mouth: The shifting power balance between
   the Ministry of Health and donors in Ghana
SO HEALTH POLICY AND PLANNING
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper describes the way in which the Ghanaian Ministry of Health deals with conflicts between donors and government which impact negatively on health system development. It argues that controlling donor investment and harnessing it towards long-term development is vital for health system sustainability. A brief background to the concept of sustainability is provided with examples of the way in which donors have exacerbated the 'sustainability problem' in Ghana. However, Ghana's unique context and its recent process of health sector reform are enabling the MOH to take the upper hand in working with donor agencies. Through decentralization, integration of health activities and restructuring, the MOH has improved its capacity to manage the process of investing in the health sector. Donors have adapted to improved MOH capacity by introducing more flexible and appropriate modes of assistance. The paper concludes that health system sustainability depends on the presence of a strong MOH to oversee investment and ensure that external resources are coordinated and channelled in a single direction, towards a single goal.

SO HEALTH POLICY AND PLANNING
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper argues that the main impediment to health system sustainability in Pakistan is the internal political climate. While favourable economic conditions have enabled a steady growth in health spending, powerful health-system stakeholders within and outside government prevent adequate and appropriate investment of these resources. Stakeholder groups, including the health and planning bureaucracies, politicians, medical professionals and the private sector, influence investment to promote their own interests, creating a hostile environment for sustainability. Evidence of this effect is found in three longstanding internal investment patterns: the favouring of urban-based curative care over rural, primary and preventive care; emphasizing infrastructure expansion over the quality and continuity of ongoing services; and allowing unregulated expansion of private health care. Reorienting investment towards sustainability requires a broad-based constituency for health system development and mechanisms to balance the desires of powerful stakeholders with the developmental needs of the health system. The implications for health system development strategies in low income countries are discussed.

TI Health care in transition in Vietnam: Equity and sustainability
SO HEALTH POLICY AND PLANNING
LA English
DT Article
AB In the context of the Save the Children Fund research programme on sustainability, Vietnam presents a distinctively different case. Despite experiencing extreme poverty, isolation and war, Vietnam boasted one of the first national PHC systems; Due to unreliable data, little can be said about its actual performance. However, it is clear that by the early 1980s the government could no longer support the health system adequately. Domestic resources became increasingly strained and the government was forced to declare its own health system unsustainable. After 1986, the health sector was incorporated into Vietnam's extensive programme of socioeconomic reform known as doi moi. Despite positive macro-economic results, doi moi reforms such as deregulation and the sanctioning of private practice are threatening the government's wish to preserve equitable access to health care. This research found that during the transformation from a socialist to a mixed health care system, 7 issues related to sustainability emerged: lack of appropriate information; underfunding; policy frameworks; regulatory frameworks and institution building; coordination and integration; community involvement; and the appropriateness of donor investment.
   Following the discussion of these issues, three overriding themes are presented. The first concerns fragmentation of the health system which is undermining the establishment of new structures and frameworks to guide the health system through its transition. Secondly, sustainability depends on an internal capacity to manage the process of change. This requires greater investment in assessing the impact of change and the development of institutional capacity to direct change at national and local level. Thirdly, a redefinition of roles and responsibilities within the health system may be required to prevent the squeezing out of state health services and ensure their sustainability.

TI Improving the quality of investment in health: Lessons on sustainability
SO HEALTH POLICY AND PLANNING
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper presents the main findings and lessons learned from the case studies presented in this issue (Nepal, Uganda, Pakistan, Ghana and Vietnam). Findings are presented according to two general themes: contextual hostility and the quality of investment in health. Five contextual factors of sustainability emerged from the case studies: economic conditions, the international aid system, the local political climate, the health care market and a country's history. Four typical patterns of investment are used to illustrate different aspects of investment quality and the role of key actors: health ministries and donors. The quality of investment depends on the nature and behaviour of these development institutions and their effect on the investment process.
   While there is no formula for sustainability, it is more likely to emerge when two basic criteria are met. First, investment strategies should correspond with environmental conditions and not clash with them. Second, investment practices should be oriented to the development needs of the health system, rather than the institutional needs of donors and health ministries. While these principles may appear self-evident, many of the currently accepted investment practices are contradictory to sustainable health system development. Reconciling investment and sustainability requires a fundamental change in the political and institutional relationships which govern the use of resources in the health sector. Guidelines for improving the quality of health sector investment in poor countries are proposed.

For this purpose, possibility of 'solar breeding system' is investigated as a kev technology for the sustainable energy supply. Then we describe our mathematical model simulating global energy supply and demand in ultra-long term. Depletion of nonrenewable resources and constraints on CO2 emissions are taken into consideration in the model. Computed results have shown that present energy system based on non-renewable resources shifts to a system based on renewable resources in the ultra-long term with appropriate incentives.

TI JOINT IMPLEMENTATION AND NORTH-SOUTH COOPERATION FOR CLIMATE-CHANGE
SO INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL AFFAIRS
LA English
DT Article
AB Joint implementation for projects addressing climate change is the subject of an ongoing debate primarily between the North and the South. That is, should the South permit investments from the North? This article examines issues ranging from cost-effectiveness to the North, and sustainable development in the South, fair compensation, carbon-sink projects, links with carbon reduction targets by the North, and effectiveness of global environmental objectives. Some of the issues are analyzed primarily from the southern perspective. The North can consider joint implementation among a portfolio of options for mitigating climate change. Even if credit for joint implementation is not given internationally, it is in the interest of the North to give internal credit for joint implementation to private enterprises in carbon tax rebates. Although joint implementation in energy efficiency benefits the South, the same cannot be said about the carbon-sink projects where problems relating to land rights, risk sharing, long-term opportunity costs, and threats to biodiversity abound. Joint implementation should be only considered in addition to the Annex I countries' commitments as one of the options for containing developing countries' emissions without compromising their development. This article concludes by supporting a pilot phase of joint implementation, which should be closely monitored.

TI TOWARD SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC-GROWTH - THE AGE OF ENERGY GASES
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Energy is an essential component of all economic activity and is required for the production of all goods and the provision of all services. Therefore, sustainable economic growth must be fueled by energy systems that are increasingly more efficient, less expensive and cleaner. In order to sustain economic growth. energy systems must increase economic productivity and competitiveness, put more people to work and must, in the near term, limit and, in the long term, reduce environmental degradation.
   There are predominantly two states of matter: solids and gases; liquid is a transitional and intermediate state of matter. At the end of the 20th century, state-of-the-art energy systems are in transition from liquid oil to gaseous methane-natural gas. We are now embarking on the ''Age of Energy Gases''-an age that will begin with natural gas-methane as our principal fuel and end with totally clean hydrogen: using basically the same infrastructure as natural gas and, therefore, the economies of planet Earth, for the first time, have a light at the end of the tunnel to sustainable economic growth.

TI REFORMULATED GASOLINE - CLEANER AIR ON THE ROAD TO NOWHERE
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
LA English
DT Article
AB U.S. legislation taking effect in 1995 and requiring the sale of cleaner reformulated gasoline in heavily polluted areas provides limited environmental benefits, but it fails to take into account the world's dwindling reserves of oil, the eroding economics of using oil, and the political and military costs of maintaining access to non-domestic supplies. In contrast, natural gas offers greater emissions reductions than reformulated gasoline, at lower fuel costs and with greater domestic supply and energy security. In the long term, the expansion of the infrastructure that would support natural gas vehicles could facilitate the transition to hydrogen which, when produced from renewable resources, could become the optimum fuel for a sustainable transportation energy economy.

ID METAPOPULATION DYNAMICS; REGENERATION; HISTORY; MODELS
AB Ecology has developed from its position as an obscure science to being at the interface of science and public policy. The impact of mankind can be described in ecological terms relating to population size, energy use and non-renewability. Sustainable development needs to be addressed on the basis of knowledge of ecological processes which maintain the environment in a state of change; the processes need to be conserved, not maintained in any particular state. Recent advances in the understanding of ecological processes are reviewed to highlight the potential contribution of this knowledge to the development of a sustainable policy. At the level of the population the significance of considering the extinction risks in the framework of spatio-temporal dynamics is now established indicating opportunities for planning land use more precisely to sustain biodiversity. Whilst the maintenance of habitats is generally the key to the persistence of biodiversity, they must be viewed as ever-changing mosaics within which cycles of succession, best described by Markovian sets of probabilities, are occurring continually. The extent to which these probabilities are distorted will determine whether the ecosystem returns to the same system or moves to a novel one. At the global level, biogeochemical cycles have a certain flexibility in relation to fluxes and stocks, hence pollution must be defined by relating the flow rate of the substance to this flexibility, which often permits the accommodation of anthropogenic perturbations. Non-sustainable processes can be defined in ecological terms, thus providing functional definitions of a sustainable policy and of sustainable development.

AB The discourse on sustainability is marked by widely differing interpretations of the concept. It is generally acknowledged, though, that sustainability concerns the interplay amongst social, economic and environmental dimensions. The emphasis on the respective components of this triumvirate differs amongst the various literatures, however, leading to alternative conceptions of the 'sustainability problem' and of the trajectory into the future. This paper seeks to elucidate a range of perspectives on sustainability, focusing particularly on interpretations in the context of agriculture and rural systems. The discussion is structured around six literatures: environmentalism and ecology, resource science, neoclassical-economic, ecological economics, political-economic and postmodernist. Closing remarks refer to the perceived need for an improved conceptualization of spatiality in the analysis of sustainability.

AB This paper examines how remote-sensing data and regional social and economic data can be used together to identify changes in land-use patterns in particular regions. Study of the spatiotemporal dynamics of remote-sensing data can identify trends in competing uses of land, water and other natural resources for agriculture, industrial development and urban settlements. When combined with information on trends in industrial production, population, agricultural production, pollutant releases, water usage and natural forest coverage, these data reveal patterns of anthropogenic disturbance that can provide early signals of problems in resource decline or land-use management. This study focuses on land-cover changes in southern Jiangsu Province of the People's Republic of China between 1976 and 1984. This region, to the west of Shanghai and to the south of the Yangtze River, experienced unprecedented economic growth after the end of the Cultural Revolution. Remote-sensing imagery reveals the rapid growth of urban centres, commensurate declines in surface water area, and changing patterns of agriculture. The observed changes cast doubt on the ability of the region to sustain such rapid and intense land-use conflicts over a long period.

AB The dwindling forests of the Central Himalaya are suffering from serious losses, threatening the subsistence population of the region. This study analyses the rate of consumption of fodder and firewood in a Central Himalayan catchment and estimates the carrying capacity of the catchment for these resources. Estimates indicate that the carrying capacity of the natural ecosystems and agroecosystems, in terms of availability of fodder and fuelwood resources, has already been exceeded.

ID LEGUMES
AB Studies were conducted on. the sustainability of style-based mini-fodder banks for peasant farmers in the subhumid zone of Nigeria between 1991 anal 1993. Dry West African Dwarf goats grazed at between 1.99 and 4.71 TLU/ha (Tropical Livestock Unit = 250 kg liveweight) during the first wet season and between 2.11 and 4.23 TLU/ha during the following season. Animals were also left on. paddocks during the dry season. Units of the ley fallow land were also cropped during the two consecutive seasons to tropical cereals. Animal Liveweight gain per head generally, decreased with increase in stocking density while gain per unit of land increased. The differences between the treatments were significant (P < 0.05) in the first season. The nutritive value of protected herbage did not vary as a result of grazing at different densities in the previous season. Regeneration of Stylosanthes hamata following grazing or cropping was mainly from old stock (about 90%). Herbage undergrowth during the first year was significantly (P < 0.05) higher on millet plots than on maize/sorghum plots. After the first season of grazing the proportion of new stands was higher on plots grazed at high stocking densities than at low density. Following the second season. of grazing and cropping, style populations were low. The understorey herbage on maize/sorghum plots was also higher than that on millet plots in the second year. No significant differences were observed between the crop plots or stocking density in the second year. S. hamata establishes rapidly in the zone but efforts will have to be made to maintain good pasture conditions from the second grazing or cropping season.

DE NATURAL RESOURCES; BANGLADESH; RESOURCE MANAGEMENT
AB Bangladesh is one of the most densely populated countries in the world with a very low per capita income. The increasing poverty and instability in the political front led to degradation of the environment and natural resources in the country. The present article reviews the current use of natural resources in Bangladesh and the emerging issues in sustainable management of those scarce resources. The paper shows that developments in one sector have adversely affected resources in related sectors and calls for an integrated approach to management of the environment and natural resources in a sustainable manner. The development of strong institutional mechanisms is necessary to facilitate the sustainable management of resources and to prevent further deterioration of the environment.

DE MULTICRITERIA; TRADE-OFF; SOIL EROSION; AGRICULTURAL CHEMICALS
AB Agricultural nonpoint source pollution of soil and water resources is a major societal concern. Because of unabated NPS pollution, and despite more than a decade of policy, research and intervention, the relationship between agricultural production and environmental performance is still the subject of ongoing debate. Invariably, the environmental objectives conflict with one another and the policy choices involve significant trade-offs. The trade-off between soil erosion and water quality is a typical example of this contradiction. This paper describes a theory and conceptual framework for integrated agricultural economic and environmental modelling using a multicriteria decision-making approach grounded in multi-attribute utility theory. The empirical analysis and policy exercise evaluates policy trade-offs using a watershed-based model. The intent is to develop and implement a framework for policy analysis that provides for a better understanding of why some environmental problems persist despite evolving policies, technologies and market incentives.
   The multi-objective decision-making model is empirically verified for a specific eastern Iowa watershed. Two key results stand out from empirical analysis. There is a significant trade-off between economic and environmental goals, and even between environmental goals; therefore, a comprehensive analysis with reasonable compromise will give an ideal solution. Incorporating environmental objectives encouraged more environmentally sound cropping practices. In particular, environmentally sustainable crop rotation practices such as corn-soybeans-hay/oats was chosen more frequently by the model. (C) 1995 Academic Press Limited

AB Population genetic studies on tunas are reviewed. These studies have focused on phylogenetic reconstructions, species identifications and stock delineation, and have used tools ranging from blood group and allozyme analysis to PCR-aided examination of mitochondrial DNA variation. Both allozyme and mtDNA approaches show tunas in the genus Thunnus to be very closely related to one another, but also indicate that the two presently recognized subspecies of northern bluefin tuna, Thunnus thynnus thynnus and T. t. orientalis, in fact may be worthy of species status. These techniques also permit the unequivocal recognition of specimens, which is not always possible on morphological grounds. However, it is arguable that, until recently, tunas have not received their due attention from geneticists given their commercial significance and the need for information on stock structure to ensure sustainable management. This may be because tunas are known to be highly vagile and therefore levels of population differentiation are expected to be low. None the less, population subdivision has been recorded in several species (skipjack, yellowfin, albacore), although this tends to be on a broad (intra- or inter-oceanic) rather than on a more local scale. New molecular tools, including the PCR-based analyses of nuclear genes and microsatellite loci, are yielding new, highly polymorphic markers, and will enable more powerful analyses of stock structure than have hitherto been possible.

AB Any suggestion of altering the genetic makeup of human beings through gene therapy is quite likely to provoke a response involving some reference to a 'slippery slope'. In this article the author examines the topography of two different types of slippery slope argument, the logical slippery slope and the rhetorical slippery slope argument. The logical form of the argument suggests that if we permit somatic cell gene therapy then we are committed to accepting germ line gene therapy in the future because there is no logically sustainable distinction between them. The rhetorical form posits that allowing somatic cell therapy now will be taking the first step on a slippery slope which will ultimately lead to the type of genocide perpetrated by the Nazis. The author tests the validity of these lines of argument against the facts of human gene therapy and concludes that because of their dependence on probabilities that cannot be empirically proven they should be largely disregarded in the much more important debate on moral line-drawing in gene therapy.

AB In a field experiment conducted on sandy soil in Florida during the 1993 season, rotation crops of castor (Ricinus communis), velvetbean (Mucuna deeringina), 'Mississippi Silver' cowpea (Vigna unguiculata), American jointvetch (Aeschynomene americana), 'Deltapine 51' cotton (Gossypium hirsutum), and 'SX-17' sorghum-sudangrass (Sorghum bicolor x S. sudanense) were effective in maintaining low population densities (<12/100 cm(3) soil) of Meloidogyne incognita race 1, whereas high population densities (>450/100 cm(3) soil) resulted after 'Clemson Spineless' okra (Hibiscus esculentus) and 'Kirby' soybean (Glycine max). Following a winter cover crop of rye (Secale cereale), densities of M. incognita following the six most effective rotation crops (1993 season) remained relatively low (less than or equal to 32/100 cm(3) soil) through midseason of an eggplant (Solanum melongena) crop planted in 1994, but increased by the end of the eggplant crop. The rotation crops planted during 1993 had little effect on yield of eggplant in 1994. Eggplant yield was inversely correlated with preplant densities (Pi) of Belonolaimus longicaudatus (r = -0.282; P less than or equal to 0.10; 46 df), but not with Pi of M. incognita. A separate microplot experiment conducted in 1994 revealed that final densities (Pf) of M. incognita race 1 following 13 different crop cultivars were lower (P less than or equal to 0.05) than Pf following a 'Pioneer X304C' corn (Zea mays) control, but only 'Mississippi Silver' cowpea and 'Sesaco 16' sesame (Sesamum indicum) resulted in lower (P less than or equal to 0.05) Pf of Paratrichodorus,minor than the corn control. It is critical that relation crops intended for suppression of individual Meloidogyne spp. be evaluated for their response to other nematode pests as well.

AB The effects of yard-waste compost on densities of plant-parasitic nematodes were determined on four crops at two sites in north Florida. Separate experiments were conducted with sweet corn (Zea mays), cowpea (Vigna unguiculata), yellow squash (Cucurbita pepo), and okra (Hibiscus esculentus). In each test, the design was a randomized complete block replicated four times and involving three treatments: 269 mt/ha yard-waste compost applied to the soil surface as a mulch, 269 mt/ha compost incorporated into the soil, and an unamended control. Final population densities of Criconemella spp. and Meloidogyne incognita were lower in plots receiving a compost treatment than in unamended control plots in only one of eight tests (P less than or equal to 0.05). Final densities of Paratrichodorus minor, Pratylenchus spp., and Xiphinema spp. were unaffected by compost treatment in all tests (P > 0.10). Vegetable yields were either unaffected by treatment or, in some tests, were lowest following the mulch treatment (P less than or equal to 0.10). Results indicate that the yard-waste compost used had little effect on densities of plant-parasitic nematodes associated with short-term (ca. 4 months) vegetable crops.

AB Many areas of social research show that images of the future influence behavior. There is evidence that traditional images of the future are becoming less believable and that we are becoming less hopeful about the future. This article explores emerging images of a sustainable society to assess their potential for renewing our sense of hope and social purpose. Four different images or scenarios are set out of the level of change that may be required to reach a sustainable future. Rough quantitative estimates are used to test the feasibility of the scenarios. The analysis suggests that most of these scenarios are well within the realm of physical possibility. It also shows that emerging images of a sustainable society have the characteristics possessed by other images of the future that have been highly influential in Western history and in other cultures. They are believable, highly positive, and open-ended, inviting further elaboration. They specifically respond to key challenges facing our society. And they set out a story of ''what is happening'' and ''what could be'' that provides an integrative perspective on the significance of today's events and choices.

TI Changes in Euro-American values needed for sustainability
SO JOURNAL OF SOCIAL ISSUES
LA English
DT Article
AB The worldview that gives rise to contemporary Euro-American values is examined and found to be no longer adaptive. The problem is traced to some of the subconscious beliefs and assumptions that underlie that worldview. In particular, our beliefs about ''human nature,'' about the causes of ''scarcity,'' and about the nature of ''progress,'' are questioned, and the ways these beliefs have led to socially and environmentally destructive institutions are traced. Sustainability, which requires both ecological awareness and sensitivity to human social needs, will depend on replacing maladaptive assumptions with others: namely, that humans are not naturally selfish, but are prosocial; that scarcity for humans is not primarily a condition of Nature, but is culturally caused; and that progress means not growing bigger or more complex, but adapting to change. These new beliefs will lead to new, more adaptive values and institutions.

This leads to sustained efforts to destroy all national barriers to trade and to make all people interdependent. The results are widespread injustice and unsustainable pressures on the environment. The Brundtland Commission's proposal of ''sustainable development,'' which involves expanding the entire economy five- to tenfold, will not work. Increasing the GNP does not correspond well with improving economic welfare, much less with social well-being. Realizing the noncorrespondence may make it possible to develop an economic order that is geared to meeting the needs of people rather than increasing production. Such an economy would be decentralized and organized from the bottom up.

AB The path to societal sustainability is strewn with barriers, opponents, and traps. That path is mainly uncharted and we can only imagine the barriers that lie ahead. By rehearsing in our minds what the barriers will look like and how they might be surmounted, we will be better prepared for the arduous expedition. Some of the barriers result from deficiencies in consciousness, knowledge, and information. People cannot intentionally change things they do not cognize. Significant barriers are being erected by opponents of environmental protection. Additional barriers stem from being trapped in our culture. Becoming aware of these barriers constituted the first step toward finding ways to surmount them. I suggest possible solutions for some barriers but others defy solution at this time.

ID RECYCLING BEHAVIOR; ENERGY-CONSERVATION
AB Attaining a sustainable future will involve dramatic changes to contemporary lifestyles. In order to promote these changes effectively it is essential to have a clear comprehension of the variables characteristic of individuals who engage in responsible environmental behavior. To this end, this paper presents three studies. The first study illustrates that no common set of variables can be used to predict a wide range of proenvironmental activity. The second study clarifies the factors that predict householders' composting, while the third study investigates householders who invest in energy efficiency.

AB Handling the huge amount of solid waste generated by our ''throw-away society'' is a major threat to a sustainable future. Recycling of used products is one important contribution toward sustainability, and social science research can help to increase its success. Of the many varied forms of recycling, residential curbside recycling is fast becoming the dominant form in the U.S., but it has been little studied. This article briefly reviews earlier research on other forms of recycling and describes the findings of several recent studies of curbside programs, including the new commingled collection method. In addition, it summarizes a study on the growth of paper recycling by businesses, and a study of consumers' environmentally conscious ''green buying,'' which can help reduce the overall amount of solid waste that is generated.

ID BOYCOTTS
AB This empirical study attempted to advance knowledge of consumer activist efforts to secure a sustainable future. The study focused on 12 environmental protection boycotts and 12 animal rights boycotts. In each instance, a representative of the boycott group and a representative of the targeted corporation were interviewed about the boycott particulars and consequences. Two noteworthy findings of the study are (1) almost all of the boycotts were media-oriented rather than marketplace-oriented, and (2) most of the boycotts were not successful in realizing their objectives. Implications of the findings are discussed for ecological change agents seeking to influence corporate policies and practices.

AB The danger of humans producing irreversible harmful changes to the environmental conditions that support life on earth is grave and imminent. Since this threat to the environment is caused by human behavior, behavioral and social scientists have an important role to play in reducing it. The goal of their efforts must be to determine and encourage patterns of life that can be sustainable into the indefinite future. The most central factor producing our environmental problems is the worldwide population explosion, which must be curtailed as soon as possible in order to provide any hope of a sustainable world. This article gives examples of valuable social science research related to population control, global environmental change, energy conservation, and reducing and recycling solid wastes.

AB Differences in the vulnerability of soils to fertility degradation are compared for two major soil groups located in the coastal plain of Tanzania and cropped with sisal (Agave sisalana). Ferralsols derived from intermediate gneiss of Precambrian age and Cambisols developed in Jurassic and Neogene limestones partly covered with Quaternary deposits were selected for comparison. A clear influence of parent material was apparent when soils were continuously cropped with sisal and no fertilizers were applied. Serious soil fertility decline occurs in Ferralsols, but Cambisols are resilient to chemical degradation and the fertility decline in these soils was very limited. The differences in degradation rates are explained by the lower initial fertility and low nutrient reserve of Ferralsols, while the Cambisols had higher initial fertility levels and nutrients removed by the sisal crop are replenished by the weathering of the underlying parent material. Sustainable soil fertility management of Cambisols includes only NPK fertilization, but heavy dressings of lime, organic manures and/or chemical fertilizers are required to improve the fertility status of the Ferralsols and to produce crops in a sustainable manner.

AB Much attention in the media and scientific literature has focused on the destruction of tropical forests in Amazonia since the early 1970s, especially in the Brazilian states of Rondonia, Acre, Para and Mate Grosso. Concern is mounting that the peeling back of the forests is wiping out biodiversity, destroying soil resources, possibly exacerbating global warming, and provoking land conflicts, among other socioeconomic and ecological problems. Yet little regard has been paid to some of the promising agricultural developments in the region that are helping to counteract pressures on the remaining forest while recuperating debilitated areas. In particular, a pronounced trend towards planting a mix of tree crops on small farms throughout the basin augers well for the future of the rainforest and more sustainable agriculture. Agroforestry developments in Amazonia underscore the linkages between conserving biodiversity and more productive and resilient agricultural systems.

AB Are marketing efforts able to affect long-term trends in sales or other performance measures? Answering this question is essential for the creation of marketing strategies that deliver a sustainable competitive advantage. This paper introduces persistence modeling to derive long-term marketing effectiveness from time-series observations on sales and marketing expenditures. First, we use unit-root tests to determine whether sales are stable or evolving (trending) over time. If they are evolving, we examine how strong this evolution is (univariate persistence) and to what extent it can be related to marketing activity (multivariate persistence). An empirical example on sales and media spending for a chain of home-improvement stores reveals that some, but not all, advertising has strong trend-setting effects on sales. We argue that traditional modeling approaches would not pick up these effects and, therefore, seriously underestimate the long-term effectiveness of advertising. The paper concludes with an agenda for future empirical research on long-run marketing effectiveness.

AB The concept of IT as a powerful competitive weapon has been strongly emphasized in the literature, yet the sustainability of the competitive advantage provided by IT applications is not well-explained. This work discusses the resource-based theory as a means of analyzing sustainability and develops a model founded on this resource-based view of the firm. This model is then applied to four attributes of IT-capital requirements, proprietary technology, technical IT skills, and managerial IT skills-which might be sources of sustained competitive advantage. From this resource-based analysis, we conclude that managerial IT skills is the only one of these attributes that can provide sustainability.

TI Effects of air temperature, air movement and artificial rain on the heat
   production of brushtail possums (Trichosurus vulpecula): An exploratory
   study
SO NEW ZEALAND VETERINARY JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
ID IMMUNE-RESPONSES; CALVES; METABOLISM
AB Two groups of six mature brushtail possums (Trichosurus vulpecula) were housed in two respiration chambers, and their heat production, whole body conductance and lower critical temperatures were measured under a variety of simulated weather patterns. The possums were subjected to ambient temperatures of 30, 20 and 3 degrees C. At 20 and 3 degrees C, the animals were exposed to near still air and light winds (wind speed 0.8 and 6.7 km/h), both with, and without, simulated rain every 8 hours. The lower critical temperature in near still air lies between 7 and 10 degrees C. This temperature increases by about 2.6 and 8 degrees C respectively for a wind velocity of 6.7 km/h, simulated rain and a combination of the two factors. Weather in New Zealand, especially in the cooler part of the year, will often produce conditions below the lower critical temperature of the thermoneutral zone of possums. This will necessitate significant increases in metabolic rate and hence food consumption or mobilisation of body fat reserves, which if not sustainable will result in the death of possums. Field studies have shown that this is often the case in the wild. It is proposed that this stress may be sufficient to decrease the resistance (especially cell-mediated immunity) of some possums and allow acceleration of the disease process in those infected with Mycobacterium bovis.

AB The paper describes how Lancashire County Council initially undertook. a 'Green Audit' in 1989 to determine the state of the environment in Lancashire and to provide a baseline for comparison purposes in the future. Following this comprehensive study, an Environmental Forum, comprising 80 organizations, was established. This was responsible for producing an Environmental Action Programme (EAP) in March 1993. The paper discusses the major measures relating to transport in the EAP and how they contribute to the relief of global warming, to reviving towns, to improving air quality, and to conserving wild life and the countryside. These measures are also linked to the sustainability objectives as put forward by the Earth Summit Conference in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, and subsequently by those of the European Union and the UK. Government.
   The paper relates the EAP measures, issued jointly by the Department of the Environment and the Department of Transport. Planning Policy Guidance on Transport (PPG13). It discusses the recommendations of recent transport studies undertaken in the major urban areas of Lancashire and the way measures to promote more sustainable transport policies have been translated into package bids for TPP purposes, The paper proceeds to describe a vehicle emissions model for assessing the effects of road improvements or traffic management measures on air pollution, and concludes with a discussion on aspects of the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution's 18th Report on Transport and the Environment.

TI Building sustainable capacity in the public sector: What can be done?
SO PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Effective government performance is central to the creation of market-oriented economies, secure and productive populations, and democratic political systems in developing countries. Capacity building to improve public sector performance is thus an important focus of development initiatives. Several implicit assumptions underlie most such efforts: that organizations or training activities are the logical site for capacity-building interventions; that administrative structures and monetary rewards determine organizational and individual performance; that organizations work well when structures and control mechanisms are in place; and that individual performance improves as a result of skill and technology transfer through training activities. Each of these assumptions is called into question by the findings of research carried out in six developing countries and reported in this article. Our studies indicate designing interventions that most constructively address sources of poor performance must follow from an assessment of a relatively broad set of variables, including the action environment in which all such activities take place. We also found that effective public sector performance is more often driven by strong organizational cultures, good management practices, and effective communication networks than it is by rules and regulations or procedures and pay scales. Our case studies further indicate that individual performance is more affected by opportunities for meaningful work, shared professional norms, teamwork, and promotion based on performance rather than it is by training in specific skills. In this article, we describe a framework or conceptual map that emphasizes that training activities, organizational performance and administrative structures are embedded within complex environments that significantly constrain their success and that often account for training or organizational failure. When it was applied in the six case study countries, the framework proved useful in identifying capacity gaps and providing a tool for the strategic design of interventions that are sensitive to the roots of performance deficits. This allows us to conclude that the assumptions underlying many capacity-building initiatives may focus attention on interventions that do not generate the highest payoffs in terms of improved performance.

TI Participatory environmental management: Contradiction of process,
   project and bureaucracy in the Himalayan foothills
SO PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Using comparative Asian experience of organizational change, this article analyses the experience of an Indian organization responsible for environmental management in the Himalayan foothills of Uttar Pradesh (UP) in moving from a standard Indian public sector approach to rural development and environmental management, to a new participatory approach. Successive World Bank funded watershed management projects in the Himalayan foothills were widely held not to have achieved and sustained their full potential in the past, largely due to an absence of effective local management of assets after the projects' end. On the other hand communities and groups have shown on a small scale a capacity to manage resources in a sustainable way. The Government of Uttar Pradesh's (UP) European Union (EU) funded Doon Valley Project has been through a first phase in which a participatory method of village level planning has been initiated. The article addresses the required changes and constraints involved in this first step of transformation. These include issues to do with organizational structure and procedures, training, gender and other social issues, and the dynamics of organizational change. The implications of a participatory approach are far reaching. The 'off the shelf' schemes that Government has offered to individuals, groups and communities in all watershed management as well as other rural development programmes are challenged both by the specificities of the Himalayan environment, and by the adoption of a genuinely participatory approach. Allowing people to decide how they will manage their hillsides requires an ability to facilitate that process. Facilitators need to have the flexibility and creativity to offer a variety of technical and managerial possibilities such that individuals, groups and communities can choose what suits them best. Constraints derive partly from the Government's set procedures and schemes in rural development, and from its advocacy of particular well worn technology packages. Constraints also derive from the way in which the whole project has been handled by Government and the Commission of the European Union from the beginning, and from the way in which technical assistance has been organized. It is important that governments and donors learn from such experiences so that future participatory environmental management work can have a greater chance of success.

TI The effects of technological innovation on hydrocarbon discoveries
SO RESOURCES POLICY
LA English
DT Article
AB Technological innovation has been an important source of continued improvement in the hydrocarbon discovery rate. A historical analysis of the drilling activity on Canada's Scotian Shelf, suggesting diminishing returns to innovation, is used to illustrate the impact innovation has had on the discovery rate, The effects of introduced technological innovation are then generalized using a simulation model. The model relies on geologic data and treats the probability of discovery as proportional to pool size and the number of pools remaining to be discovered. A discovery efficiency parameter representing the degree of technical sophistication is included in the model, By varying the parameter in repeated experiments, inferences about the implications of technological innovation can be made, Results indicate that although early improvements in exploration technology are capable of improving the discovery rate, these improvements do not maximize discoverable volumes when a minimum economic discovery size rule is used to determine when exploration activity ceases, Furthermore, such innovations do not contribute to attaining sustainable resource use because they result in accelerated depletion of the resource base.

ID NORTHERN GULF; COASTAL; MEXICO
AB At least 43 agriculture fields were built in south Louisiana wetlands between 1900 and 1920 using pumps and levees. All but one project is now abandoned as a result of soil subsidence, financial difficulties, or multiple levee failures. Some are now in flood-protected urban zones, and the remainder are mostly open water. The total area of abandoned agricultural fields in 1990 is large (> 80,000 ha), and their levees continue to deteriorate naturally. Ten failed or abandoned coastal agricultural impoundments (22,680 ha) were examined to determine recent wetland restoration or regression rates from 1978 to 1988. Wetland area and levee length were determined from aerial photography for 1978, 1983, 1985, and 1988. Average wetland change rates for all areas ranged from -4.28 to +2.54% per year from 1978 to 1988. One site gained wetland area between 1978 and 1988 (77 ha/yr), and four sites gained wetland area between 1985 and 1988 (range 14-439 ha/yr). Wetland area in the other sites either remained stable or declined during the study period. The results from a multiple regression model indicate that restoration is inversely related to impoundment size and directly related to levee reduction. Results from a multiple regression model indicate that active levee removal will probably enhance wetland restoration rates at a very favorable cost (< $1/ha) and will be sustainable with little additional management.

AB The standard view is that value is added to raw material by labor and capital. The question here discussed is whether or not raw material must contain value previously added by nature, or whether it can be simply inert indestructible building blocks. Can humanly added value substitute for value added by nature? If the answer were yes, it should be possible, since matter-energy is not destroyed in consumption, to substitute the waste flow of matter-energy for the flow of fresh natural resources (raw materials). But this would contradict the second law of thermodynamics. The quality of low entropy is what differentiates raw material from waste, and we know of no process whose net effect is to lower the entropy of the total system on which we depend. We must focus more on ''that to which value is added,'' and not just on value added. This is especially true as the former more and more replaces the latter as the limiting factor in production. Further consequences of the two different views about value added for theory and policy are discussed.

AB Economies entirely dependent upon local environmental resources should have a greater incentive to preserve those resources than economies based on specialization and trade. Evidence from history and prehistory, however, shows that many regionally based economies have collapsed because of environmental overexploitation. Evidence from the past shows that there is a strong connection between environmental degradation, power, and social instability. There seems to be a complex and recurring pattern in early civilizations of expansion, a flourishing of culture and art, and then social disintegration and collapse as ruling elites pushed the expansion of material culture beyond the limits of the environment to support it. Recognizing the importance of the relationship between power, environmental sustainability, and social vulnerability is essential in formulating ecologically sustainable trade policies.

AB The economic values which nontraded and traded environmental goods and services, or negative externalities, might be given, depend (in different ways) on the distribution of income. Income-elasticity (in actual or surrogate markets) might be greater for environmental ''amenities'' than for environmental ''necessities.'' Therefore, a redistribution of income would have effects on the demand of environmental goods and services. But this is not the main line of this paper, which is more focused on the ''supply side.''
   From the ''supply side,'' the distribution of income (and of property rights) will determine (in a Sraffian-like manner) the value (or rather, the ''production prices'') of traded ''natural capital.'' However, most environmental goods and services are not in the market. Tn this respect, the paper introduces the concept of ''ecological distribution,'' i.e. the social, spatial, and temporal asymmetries in the access to natural resources or in the burdens of pollution (whether traded or not), and it considers the relations between economic distribution and ecological distribution. In other words, the paper discusses the relations between Political Economy and Political Ecology.
   The paper also includes a section on the appropriate discount rate which would be that determined by the ''sustainable'' productivity of capital; but the measure of sustainability depends on the measure of depreciation of ''natural capital,'' and the measure of ''natural capital'' depends on the allocation of property rights, and on the distribution of income.
   The final section explores the links between distributional issues and economic incommensurability.

DE sustainability; feminist theory; assessment methods; valuation concepts
AB The recent focus on sustainability as guiding principle for economic activity has generated many (often conflicting) definitions of sustainable economic development. Yet while the terminology may be new, the discussion is not. It parallels the discussion about biases of economic valuation concepts that have led to the neglect of the domestic and subsistence contributions relegated to the ''informal'' or household sector. This paper argues that the narrow definition of economic theory, methodology, and valuation concepts has led to the detrimental neglect of sustaining functions without which economic activity is impaired. To move toward sustainability it is imperative to regain a broader understanding of economics. Three principles are identified as essential for this conceptual expansion of economics. They are: concreteness rather than abstraction, connectedness rather than isolation, and diversity rather than homogeneity. All three are informed by feminist theory. Thus it is argued that the voices of women who have gone largely unheard in economics are essential to reconceptualizing economics as sustainable.

TI A relational society-nature approach: The ecotome
SO REVISTA CHILENA DE HISTORIA NATURAL

DT Article
DE organism-''entorno''; relations; society nature; ecotome
AB Based upon society-nature relation, a new system to classify territories is proposed. The ecotome constitutes the basic classification unit of them. It can be defined as ''the whole of relations that is capable of mantaining the emergent organization of the society-nature complex unit, which at the same time are capable of re-organizing and reproducing in such manner that resolves its energetic and informational sustainability along the space-time axis''. It is assumed that culture emerges from society-nature relation. The notion of ''entorno'' is discussed and its mutual dependence upon the organism is emphasized. Both etymology and meaning of ethos, oikos, ''entorno'' and ecotome are discussed. The spanish word entorno has a more complete and relational sense accordingly both to greek language and its etymology. It derives from en: between and tornos: circular movement. For there to be entorno there must be something or somebody. This situation is not necessarily true with words such as ambiente, medio ambiente, environ or millieu. Notwithstanding, umwelt, in the sense of von Uexkull, has the closest meaning to our entorno notion. The intimate relation between Ethology and Ecology is also shown. To explain how the commonly considered isolated components organism/society and entorno/nature articulate in the form of a relation, a reference background is given. Some features and concepts concerning the ecotome are stated.

DT Article
AB Many analysts of sustainable agriculture have given considerable attention to issues of knowledge production, but in general they have not engaged social movement theory. This neglect is addressed by examining the emergence of intensive rotational grazing as a local expression of the sustainable agriculture movement. Conceptual frameworks drawn from recent contributions to social movement theory are used to describe the cognitive praxis of graziers along technological, cosmological, and organizational dimensions. Contrary to current interpretations, which emphasize the idiosyncratic character of local knowledge in agriculture, this analysis shows that through horizontal forms of organizing and information exchange, graziers overcome the limits of their personal experience and usefully share local knowledge in networks that they have forged expressly for that purpose.

AB The pineapple growing industry of south-east Queensland began as a ''pioneer'' industry because farmers could purchase and develop steep sloping land with a small amount of capital. Over a period of 50 years, considerable areas have been abandoned while other new areas have been developed. Such commercial farming is a source of agricultural pollutants that could endanger the quality of coastal habitats and the expanding tourism industry. This paper reports 3 years of soil erosion and hydrology results from one pineapple-growing farm. Field experiments were established to find out row lengths that would allow sustainable production from steep sloping land (33-38%). The farmer's up-and-down slope row lengths of 7 m were investigated, but also increased to 12 m and 22 m for comparison. It was found that the hydrology of the shaley regosol was influenced by exfiltration from small areas on the lower slopes. ''Talc-like'' lines of soil had high rates of transmissivity in parts of the midslope and water moved in these sub-surface lenses as hillslope throughflow before exfiltrating down slope, When events influenced by throughflow were deleted and runoff was separated into thunderstorms and rain depressions, it was found that row length affected peak runoff rates but not total depth of runoff. Soil erosion of 7 m and 12 m long rows was very similar but increased by 4 times due to rilling in the 22 m long rows, Multiple regression analysis showed that precipitation-related variables were important in un-rilled rows while runoff type variables were significant in rilling. Cumulative El(30) was found to be a useful surrogate for soil surface armouring and consolidation in the prediction of soil loss and sediment concentrations for events. Sediment concentrations were strongly influenced also by event type (thunderstorms versus rain depressions). Beta values (used as an index of soil erodibility) were also affected by event type, but showed a decline through time as the soil consolidated. The study established maximum permissible row lengths for the farming system studied and provided guidelines for improvement of the system.

AB Indigenous forest in Kwa Zulu-Natal has been fairly well described; however, very little has been published on its dynamics. There is, to our knowledge, nothing published on disturbance regimes, dendrology and life histories of constituent species. In order to assess the conservation status, management and sustainability of these forests we have developed a dynamic framework by synthesizing information collected in many randomly located 400-m(2) sample plots in a range of forest types. We reasoned that ordinations between understorey and overstorey data from these plots would indicate the grain of a forest. Fine-grained forests would be indicated by close proximity, in ordination space, of understorey and overstorey. Similarly we argue that a predominance of canopy species with negative exponential size-class distributions should typify the more fine-grained forests. Our analyses suggest the following dynamics spectrum: from fine-grained upland forests with in situ recruitment from advanced regeneration for most canopy species, to coarse-grained lowland forests where canopy species have flat size-class distributions and spatially variable recruitment, These results are discussed with a view to the conservation of the different types.

DE The Gambia; sustainable tourism development
ID DEVELOPMENT POLICY
AB This paper analyses the development constraints which confine The Gambia to being one of the poorest countries in the world. The programmes designed to reduce these constraints are outlined. In particular, tourism is identified as an appropriate development strategy. Using primary data, tourism in The Gambia, its development and administation are described in some detail. Althoiugh a prima facie case can be made extolling the virtues of tourism in that country, the industry is beset by a range of problems. The juxtaposition of the country's growing reliance on tourism against increasing stagnation in the sector is a focus of particular concern. Constraints in the tourism sector are identified in the spheres of policy formulation and implementation, capital investment, human resource endowment, existing and potential tourist markets, seasonality issues and product resource base. For each constraint identified, a management strategy is proposed. In essence, the article is an advocation of sustainable tourism development for The Gambia based on long-term holistic planning, including appropriate resource development, community involvement, education and training.

AB Alternative tourism is increasingly regarded as a key to sustainable development. The rationale is that contrary to mass tourism with its commonplace negative effects on receiving areas, alternative tourism promotes a balanced growth form more in tune with local environmental and sociocultural concerns. Yet, academics are becoming increasingly skeptical as to whether alternative tourism can be truly sustainable. This paper examines a case study of the Cypriot government's recent efforts to introduce alternative tourism as a rural development strategy in the Akamas peninsula. Evidence reveals that failure to involve the local rural communities in the decision-making process plus the inability of policy makers to form an integrated vision for the entire region form major obstacles towards realizing the goal of sustainable development.

AB Historical increases in the density of unpalatable shrubs and trees have reduced the carrying capacity and threaten the sustainability of livestock production in arid and semi-arid grasslands and savannas around the world. Biodiversity, wildlife habitat and nutrient cycling (rates, magnitude, seasonality and spatial patterns) are also affected by these changes in vegetation. While historical increases in woody plane abundance have been widely noted, the rates, dynamics, spatial patterns and proximate causes have not been well documented. Here, I briefly review potential explanations for increased abundance of woody plants in dryland ecosystems and discuss how activities of domestic and native herbivores might influence the balance between grasses and woody plants. Conceptual models of woody plant seedling establishment in grazed ecosystems are presented and evaluated with case studies of an invasive North American arborescent, honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa). Reduction in grass interference, achieved experimentally or by grazing, may have a positive effect on woody plants but is not a prerequisite for successful seedling establishment in many systems. It is argued that thresholds of herbaceous utilisation required for woody plants to establish successfully may be readily exceeded, even at light levels of grazing. Thus, grazing management schemes muse aggressively incorporate the use of fire as well as emphasise the degree of grass utilisation and maintenance of species composition, if dominance of woody plants is to be regulated successfully.

AB We still have insufficient knowledge about the way that different types of vehicles are actually used (loads, driving behaviour etc.). This means that most statements on specific and aggregate emissions as well as on the cost-effectiveness of different measures should be judged with caution. There is still large scope for reducing emissions from transport by technical measures. This is particularly true for shipping, off-road vehicles and for most types of road vehicles. Improved maintenance and extended durability of emission control systems seem to be among the most cost-effective measures where road transport is concerned. The contribution from improved grades of diesel and petrol towards lower aggregate emissions of acidifying substances is likely to be small. Changing the modal split could be expected to be an expensive way of reducing air pollution from road transport except for regions suffering from congestion.

ID PRECIPITATION
AB For many centuries, human activities have become progressively more significant forces in the biogeochemical circulation of matter in the earth. In recent decades, the phenomena and effects of acidification have played a central role in scientific and social learning about both human impacts on ecosystems and the importance of regional, international, and global strategies in environmental protection. The history of acidification research and policy analysis in Europe and North America is reviewed in an attempt to discover lessons that can be learned from past successes and shortcomings in environmental research and policy. These lessons are summarized in the context of distinctions among possible futures, probable futures, and preferable futures in industrial and developing regions. These analyses indicate four general needs for the future: 1) New paradigms for certain types of scientific research - especially natural resources and environmental research, 2) Effective mechanisms to ensure quality, integrity, and social- and policy-relevancy in science itself and in science-based assessments of alternative means by which societies can achieve economic-development and environmental goals; 3) Guidelines for the collaborative roles that scientists, policy analysts, decision makers, and professional communicators in democratic societies should play at the interface between science and public policy; and 4) Further debate, public understanding and increased acceptance of ethical guidelines in making decisions among probable futures, possible futures, and preferable futures in the relationships between humans and ''The Nature.'' Such guidelines could be based on: a) Aldo Leopold's concept of land ethics, b) Gro Brundtland's concept of sustainable development, c) van Rensselaer Potter's concept of ecological bioethics, and d) Immanuel Kant's categorical imperative - ''Act only on that maxim whereby thou canst at the same time will that it should become a universal law''.

AB In a sustainable forestry recirculation of nutrients through the application of ashes from forest residues can be an essential way to guarantee healthy and vital forests. Wood ashes can also be regarded as a measure against soil acidification. Wood ashes were applied at various rates to the soil in a 35 years old pine (Pinus sylvestris, L) stand at Ringamala in Blekinge, South Sweden. The experiments started in 1984. The different treatments gave a clear effect on soil chemistry with decreased acidity and aluminum ion concentrations. The base saturation increased in both mor and upper mineral soil layers. Generally no significant increases were found in soil concentrations of heavy metals, except for Cu which increased significantly in the mor layer. Also the extractable Mn concentration increased, in spite of the increased pH in the soil after application of ashes. In order to achieve a biological circulation of nutrients through ash application without polluting the environment, it is of ultimate importance that the wood chips used in power plants and other furnaces have a low concentration of heavy metals and other pollutants.

AB The changed political situation and recognition of the acute destruction of the natural environment in Poland have caused a series of actions aimed at preventing further deterioration of Polish environment One of the most important events which took place in the last few years was the enactment by the Polish Parliament in May 1991 of the Act on the National Ecological Policy. The basic assumption of the new environmental policy is a declaration that sustainable development will in future direct economic development in Poland.
   The aim of the presented paper is to introduce existing policy of air protection and instruments which have been implemented to protect the air. Special attention will be paid to legislation instruments, introduction and enforcement of proper economic mechanisms strengthening air protection and foreign policy aiming at increasing foreign assistance for this objective.

SO WORLD DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper argues that current agricultural policy in El Salvador is failing to further the goals of macroeconomic growth and stability, sustainable livelihood security, and environmental sustainability. Macroeconomic policy has turned relative prices sharply against agriculture. The plight of the rural poor has been exacerbated by continuing inequities in the agrarian structure. The breakdown in rural livelihoods and limited access to land and other assets is accelerating environmental degradation. Suggested alternative policies such as more favorable price policies, agrarian reform, and environmental restoration would promote sustainable development by capitalizing on the complementarity among growth, poverty reduction and consolidation of peace.

ID RISK; FOREST
AB The optimal exploitation of a population is considered for three stochastic population models; these allow both demographic and environmental variability and the possibility of extinction. The dynamics are linear in the harvest rate; the optimal policy then recommends harvesting at the maximal rate above a critical level (the 'threshold') and at zero rate below. However, in all cases the optimal threshold differs radically according as to whether one maximizes the total return before extinction or the rate of return per unit time over the period before extinction. In the former case the optimal threshold is at the deterministic equilibrium level of the unexploited population, in the latter case it is approximately at the level of maximal sustainable production. Part of the explanation is that maximization of total yield turns out to be almost equivalent to maximization of time to extinction. Both average yield rate and the expected time to extinction vary with the policy, but the second much more powerfully. Both the criteria above are extreme: one obtains a balanced criterion (and an intermediate threshold) if one maximizes rate of return (before extinction) subject to the conservation requirement of a lower bound on the expected time to extinction. In the case when extinction is excluded because of a potential 'rescue effect' one comes to the same view by taking account of the relative time needed to restart an obliterated population. The practical implication is that more attention should be paid to extinction and restart times. For vulnerable populations it is likely that maximal utilization before an inevitable extinction will be achieved at low harvest rates. For large populations or metapopulations, with large times to extinction or quick recovery from a temporary extinction, classical resource models are appropriate.

AB A sustainable mass-culture system (4 m(2) basal surface area) of the meiobenthic harpacticoid copepod Amphiascoides atopus, capable of producing in excess of one million individuals and over 5 g dry weight biomass per day, was successfully designed and implemented. The system consists of culture tanks containing a shallow layer of limestone cobble facilitating naupliar and juvenile copepodite development. Adults and older copepodites swim into the overlying water which is recirculated and filtered, expediting their clean capture. A. atopus ranges in length from 0.19 mm (for Nauplius I) to 0.92 mm in the adult, and up to 5 mu g dry weight. Copepods were fed either cultured algae (Chaetocerous muelleri, strain Chaet 10) or commercial fish-flake food, and grew well on each diet or a mixture. Amphiascoides atopus life history patterns are favorable for mass culture. Clutch size averages 24 eggs per ovigerous female, and new egg clutches are produced every 3-4 days. When cultured at 23 degrees C, life expectancy is about 3 mo, and generation time is less than one month. Preliminary laboratory feeding experiments with various shrimp and fishes and suggest that A. atopus may prove to be an excellent food source for larvae, post-larvae and juveniles and may serve as an alternative live prey to brine shrimp in mariculture applications.

AB Data from two detailed field experiments were used to investigate the turbulence within inertia-buoyancy balanced axisymmetric intrusive gravity currents entering nearly quiescent stratified water bodies. The intrusions were generated by energetic point source bubble plume systems installed within different freshwater reservoirs, and the mixing activity was recorded with microstructure profilers. Close to the bubble plume, the intrusions were found to be very turbulent. The turbulent activity within the intrusions was observed to decay most rapidly in the intrusion core, but the shear at the upper and lower boundaries of the intrusions maintained the turbulence in these regions for along distance. The results showed that the turbulence began with a length scale equal to the maximum sustainable overturn length for internally generated shear and hence a turbulent Froude number near unity. As the intrusions moved away from the generation region, the Froude number remained near unity, but the Reynolds number decreased with distance; the shear generated by the intrusion thus sustained an active turbulence field, albeit with ever-decreasing length scales.

AB Changes in soil chemical properties under natural bush regrowth, planted fallows (i.e. Guinea grass (Panicum maximum), Leucaena leucocephala, and pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan)) and under continuous cropping with minimum tillage (i.e. maize (Zea mays L.)/cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) intercrop and maize monoculture with residue returned or removed), were monitored for 13 years after clearing of secondary forest on a kaolinitic Alfisol in Nigeria, West Africa. Under bush fallow, soil organic C (SOC) decreased during the first 7 years, then increased to the original level of approximately 20 g kg(-1) at 12 years, whereas soil pH, exchangeable Ca and Mg and ECEC remained relatively constant. Chemical soil properties under Guinea grass and leucaena fallows compared favorably to those under bush fallow, whereas chemical properties of the surface soil under pigeon pea fallow deteriorated. Under continuous maize cropping, soil organic C decreased during the first 7 years, then reached a steady-state at about 65% of the level maintained by bush fallow. The surface soil under continuous maize also became acidified. Maize grain yields of the first season declined from 6.0 t ha(-1) to 2.5 t ha(-1) during 7 years of cropping. Relative yield sustainability of the three cropping systems was maize/cassava intercrop > maize monoculture with residue returned > maize monoculture with residue removed.

AB The energetic cost of signalling may be important in maintaining the honesty of the signal, yet it is rarely measured directly. Oxygen consumption during crowing by roosters, Gallus gallus domesticus, was measured in a closed-circuit indirect calorimeter. Although there was a positive relationship between crowing and O-2 consumption, roosters consumed only 0.005 ml/g/h for each vocalization. Thus at the average crowing rate, O-2 consumption rate would be 15% above standing, which is less than the cost of low-level activities such as feeding, drinking and preening, and over 10 times less than the maximum sustainable metabolic rate. These results contrast with previous reports of high energy consumption during calling in insects and frogs, which approach or exceed maximal levels. Other costs, such as predation and social retaliation, are probably more important than energetic costs in maintaining crowing as an honest signal.

TI Designing with plastics: Considering part recyclability and the use of
   recycled materials
SO AT&T TECHNICAL JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB It is a widely shared view that economic development will not be sustainable unless industry embarks on more innovative and proactive approaches to corporate environmental stewardship. ''Green'' product realization strategies-such as design for recycling (DFR)-and the increased use of recycled materials in the manufacture of new products are viewed as crucial components of such an approach. AT&T's design and engineering community is active in both fields. DFR is introduced as part of a broader design for environment (DFE) program. In addition, there are ambitious initiatives to find suitable internal uses for plastics recyclate, which AT&T's material reclamation organizations have produced from scrapped telephone housings for many years. These two programs are symbiotic: The greater the number of products designed for recycling, the greater the amount of high-value materials that can be readily recovered from them at the end of their useful lives. In turn, the higher the quality of the recycled materials, the easier to recycle those materials into new products. This paper describes strategies for DFR applicable to plastic parts and discusses two initial applications of post-consumer recycled plastics in new AT&T products.

DE TASMANIA; SOIL EROSION; FARM PLANNING; AGRICULTURAL PROCESSING FIRMS;
   SUSTAINABLE LAND USE
ID SOIL-EROSION
AB The core questions pertaining to contract farming or 'vertical co-ordination' relate to the ownership of decision-making, Where decision-making is partly removed from farmers there arise issues of sustainability which are inadequately addressed by current practice, A mail questionnaire conducted in North-west Tasmania in 1990-91 obtained responses from 310 farmers, a 68 per cent return rate from the 456 valid cases initially identified. At the time of the survey, 119 respondents were involved in contract cropping, and a majority of these responses indicated a need for greater co-ordination in farm planning. This co-ordination requires a re-think of the roles of both agribusiness firms and farmer organisations, as well as acceptance by farmers that long-term planning for crop rotation and soil management has associated self-benefit. Responsibility for soil erosion is seen to lie partly at the feet of processing firms which relegate production tasks to farmers under contract, but frequently appear to ignore the impact of shortterm planning horizons upon farmer capacity to manage soils for erosion minimisation. With few exceptions, such as the processor firm specialising in the perennial crop pyrethrum and one onion processor that encourages soil conservation, in North-west Tasmania processing firms generally play no part in planning for sustainable land use.

AB This paper examines the link between poverty and land management within the context of New Zealand's almost total removal of subsidies to agriculture since 1984. The impact of these policy changes is explored through the findings from a detailed study of sixteen farms in the North Island hill country. Stress is identified as a primary link between social damage and environmental degradation. This link reinforces the impact of other linkages expressed in reduced production, lower stocking rates, and reduced capital inputs. Deregulation is claimed to be good. This paper shows that in certain circumstances this is not so.

TI WOMEN IN AGRICULTURE - ADVOCATES FOR A GENDERED SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE

AB A gendered consideration of rural geography has been barely discernible within Australian and New Zealand literature. The notable exceptions in this case have illustrated the complexity and merit of studying the gender patterns and relations of rural life. Outside geography, there is an expanding literature on rural women in Australia. These works parallel significant developments in the lives and politics of rural and agricultural women themselves. This paper reports selected findings from a study of the women in agriculture movement in Australia. As such, it illustrates the increased awareness of the gendered conditions of farming. The women in agriculture movement works to increase the recognition of women's contribution to agriculture. In doing so it affirms the legitimacy of women farmers' voices and perspectives. There will be no sustainable rural systems while half the rural population is unseen or unheard. Women in agriculture demonstrate a social dimension of sustainability. They highlight the need to integrate gender equity and a 'wider-than-economic' conceptualisation of sustainable agriculture. Their actions can stimulate rural geographers to further consider the social and political aspects of rural sustainability beyond the conventional farm/industry and community service sites we usually consider.

AB This paper brings anthropological, sociological and geographical perspectives to bear on the problem of farm sustainability and, in particular, the legitimation of sustainable farm practices. It attempts to lay some theoretical foundations for explanation of the adoption of farming practices which may, or may not, promote sustainability. A brief survey of the literature surrounding these issues finds many of the current theoretical perspectives incapable of fully accounting for the complexity of farming practice. Reductionist decision/rational-action models, in particular, are found wanting for their lack of both cultural consistency and social/spatial specificity. Instead, this paper promotes a generative structuralist approach directed towards an analysis of social and economic practice in lived space; that is, firmly anchored in long-term ethnographic research.

TI RURAL RESTRUCTURING AND SOCIAL SUSTAINABILITY - SOME REFLECTIONS ON THE
   WESTERN-AUSTRALIAN WHEAT-BELT
SO AUSTRALIAN GEOGRAPHER
LA English
DT Article
DE RURAL RESTRUCTURING; SOCIAL SUSTAINABILITY; EQUITY; COMMUNITY; RURALITY;

AB Over the past three decades the Western Australian wheatbelt has undergone dramatic economic, environmental and social changes precipitated, primarily, by the process of rural restructuring. Farm amalgamation, environmental degradation, labour market adjustments and severe population decline have been consistently noted trends throughout much of the wheatbelt. The ongoing and integrated nature of these problems has led to increasing calls for a more holistic approach to sustainable rural development. This paper argues that while considerable efforts are being made to find solutions to the economic and environmental problems faced in the wheatbelt, these endeavours do not address many important problems faced by rural communities. It therefore advocates the inclusion of a social dimension in any attempt to achieve an overall goal of rural sustainability.
