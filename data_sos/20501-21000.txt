AB Uncertainties in fisheries arise in three principal forms: random fluctuations, uncertainty in parameter estimates and states of nature, and structural uncertainty that reflects a basic lack of knowledge about the nature of the fishery system. The first two of these have been addressed quantitatively through a variety of analytical tools, reviewed briefly in this paper. On the other hand, structural uncertainty poses a greater challenge; having proven rather immune to analytical treatment, it appears to be best addressed through the design of fishery management itself, to ensure that such management is robust, adaptive and precautionary. The paper discusses the nature of these three management characteristics, and illustrates their importance through an analysis of Atlantic Canada's groundfish fishery and its collapse in the early 1990s. The groundfishery is also used as a case study for exploring the extent to which fishery institutions provide a framework for 'living with uncertainty'; specifically, an analysis is provided of fishery management and conservation institutions (notably the Fisheries Resource Conservation Council) that have been established in response to the groundfish collapse.

AB Around the world, many commercial fisheries are in crisis. The failure of the traditional management models, centered on calculations of maximum sustainable yields (MSY) from individual species or stocks has complicated efforts to come to terms with this situation. A growing emphasis both on interdependencies in large marine ecosystems (LMEs) and on the non-linear or chaotic changes that are prominent features of these systems highlights the biophysical uncertainties affecting fisheries management. Less familiar is the proposition that efforts to manage fisheries are affected by institutional uncertainties as well. These uncertainties stem from: (1) contradictions embedded in fisheries regimes as an outgrowth of institutional bargaining, (2) vague or ambiguous formulas arising from the pressures of negotiation processes, (3) the complexity of specific institutional arrangements, (4) gaps between regimes on paper and regimes in practice, (5) compliance problems, (6) linkages between individual fisheries regimes and other international institutions, and (7) limited capacity to forecast how fisheries regimes will evolve over a period of time. Not all institutional uncertainties are bad. The existence of a thick 'veil of uncertainty,' for example, may contribute to the development of successful fisheries regimes by giving participants incentives to pay attention to considerations of fairness. But any effort to manage international fisheries effectively must reckon with the existence of institutional as well as biophysical uncertainties in this realm. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB In this presentation the objectives for the Norwegian fishery policy are described, and practical management questions for which scientific contributions seems vital are outlined. Norwegian fisheries are managed so as to meet both the multi-faceted objectives of the Norwegian fishery policy and international commitments. In accordance with the former, fishery managers are to aim for a policy which, on the one hand ensures that marine resources give sustainable yields and on the other hand, supports the existing pattern of settlement along the coast, provides job security for the fishermen and increases the value-added in the fisheries sector. These objectives, stated in several White Papers to the Norwegian Parliament, reflect the conflicting interests forwarded by different groups in society. As managers, however, these are the objectives we are to fulfil, and in doing so, we rely on several different measures, often categorised as input regulations, output regulations and technical regulations. In addition, several international Declarations and Agreements i.e. (the Rio declaration, the UN Agreement on Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks, the Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries and the North Sea Conference) all point out that fisheries should be managed in accordance with the precautionary approach. The scope for research in practical fishery management will mainly be defined by the management problem at hand. The solutions to some management problems are not hampered first and foremost by lack of knowledge, but by conflicting interests among various user groups. There are, however, at least two regulatory issues where scientific contributions seem to be most needed. These are the choice of exploitation rate (management strategy) and the choice of exploitation pattern (selectivity). To conduct good management of the various fish stocks, management strategies are needed which identify limit and target reference points. In addition, managers need means of evaluating these limit reference points. In this work, scientific contributions in the fields of ecology, biology, economics and statistics are vital. Furthermore, there is a need for scientific contributions in order to harvest the fish stocks with the most desirable exploitation pattern. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

DE bioeconomic advice fisheries; harvest control rule northeast Arctic cod;

ID BARENTS SEA ECOSYSTEM; STOCKS
AB The total allowable catch (TAC) is a key instrument in the management of several important fish stocks in the Barents and the Norwegian Seas, and advice on TAC levels used to be based purely on biological information and guidelines from the International Council for the Exploration of the Seas (ICES). In 1991, ICES Advisory Committee on Fisheries Management (ACFM) stated that its objective was to provide the advice necessary to maintain viable fisheries within sustainable ecosystems, leaving the actual choice of management strategy and corresponding TAC for stocks within safe biological limits to managers. In arriving at such a choice, managers should ideally state their objectives in exploiting their fish resource, and analyse the relevant consequences of different levels of TAC. Norway is one of the major 'share-holders' in the fish stocks in the Barents and Norwegian Seas and the country's fishery policy reflects several national objectives, as well as international commitments. In the light of these objectives, the 'state of the art' advice on management strategy and corresponding TAC levels given by experts in the Norwegian fishery management is described. Two transboundary stocks, northeast Arctic cod (Gadus morhua) and Norwegian spring spawning herring (Clupea harengus), serve as examples. The advice is built on analyses of biological and economic consequences, and prognoses for 5 and 10 years are used for cod and herring respectively. In the analysis of the cod fishery, we will show how the optimal management strategy or harvest control rule will change when calculating private economic yield rather than social economic yield. Uncertainty attached to the recruitment model of the Norwegian spring spawning herring and the inclusion of such uncertainty in the advice is dealt with explicitly. The objective of this paper is to illustrate some means of applying existing biological and economic knowledge in practical advice on the choice of TAC. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB The aim of this article is to draw attention to the public health hazards and socio-ecological problems posed by the street food industry in Africa. To mitigate these problems and enhance sustainable development of the street food trade, the paper emphasizes the need for African countries to intensify the education of street food consumers, and vendors in particular on basic food safety matters and formulate their codes of practice for street foods using the Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) approach. In: view of their general weakness on the individual basis, consumers are urged to form organizations through which they can assert their rights and be heard on matters affecting them.

TI The environment in an 'Information Society' - A transition stage towards
   more sustainable development?
SO FUTURES

ID ECOLOGICAL MODERNIZATION; RISK SOCIETY; TECHNOLOGY; SOCIOLOGY; FUTURE
AB Social scientists and futurists have suggested that societal development is advancing to a novel stage, to an 'information society', However, the crucial qualifiers of this 'new' society are ambiguous, Furthermore, environmental goals have created new challenges for information society studies, This paper examines the interaction and dynamics between the information society and sustainable development, which most often manifest themselves as competing scientific and socio-political discourses. On the one hand, there is the potential for reducing the stress on the environment: the emergence of information technologies and services can lead to a dematerialisation of production and immaterialisation of consumption, On the other hand, there are risks: positive environmental effects might be overcome by the 'rebound effect' caused by excessive economic growth. It is concluded that further theoretical and empirical studies are needed in order to examine the complex and contradictory relationship between the information society and environmental issues.

AB A gigantic urban revolution is under way today: in 40 years, the equivalent of 1000 cities, each of three million inhabitants, will have to be built. In 2005, half of the world's population will live in cities. This growth will be concentrated in major cities, most of them in the South. This article reviews some fundamental trends, challenges and possible solutions in environment-related fields such as water, transports, energy. It argues for the emergence of a new urban culture based on the adoption of sustainable urban consumption patterns, new urban partnerships and the strengthening of urban solidarities. It gives examples of practical solutions within our reach for humanizing cities in the 21st century. (C) 1998 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The author challenges the conventional wisdom that the main risk to Western development is environmental degradation caused by mankind. Concern over the greenhouse effect and global warming have more to do with millenium fever than reality. There is still very little evidence to suggest that these environmental phenomena result from human activity. What we do know is that there have been major cyclical fluctuations throughout history. The author cautions against implementing 'scientistic' policies in the face of such doubts, just because it is trendy to do so. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI The ecological footprint of New Zealand as a step towards sustainability
SO FUTURES
LA English
DT Article
AB Three studies have derived ecological footprints for New Zealand. Two were done in NZ and are based on land area only. The third is part of an international study which includes marine resources. Absolute comparisons in physical parameters are difficult as they do not all have the same baseline. Relative comparisons, as a proportion of carrying capacity exclusive of marine resources, are comparable, viz. 86, 60 and 70%. Precaution and the maintenance of biodiversity imply that we should live well within our carrying capacity. New Zealand therefore could be considered as already over populated at our present life style and relative to the global carrying capacity. The international study of 52 nations (80% of the world's population) derives an average global footprint (2.8 ha/cap), inclusive of marine resources, that is greater than the global ecological capacity (2.1 ha/cap). NZ has a very large footprint at 7.6 ha/cap whilst being the most bounteous of all with an ecological capacity of 20.4 ha/cap. However the marine ecological capacity for NZ is proportionately very large (50% of our total capacity) but uncertain and so should be disregarded. Exclusive of the marine component, the NZ footprint and capacity are 7.4 and 10.5 ha/cap respectively-the 70% reported above. A significant minority in New Zealand would not feel they are enjoying the bounty expressed by these figures. There are several reasons-we undervalue nature's wealth; quantitative growth is unsustainable; we are losing control of our resources; our economic system is flawed. Even so, achieving greater equity within NZ and between nations within the global capacity will not in itself lead to sustainability-to biophysical sustainability perhaps, but that is only survival. Sustainability pertains to the interior, subjective dimensions in life which have no location and are not quantifiable but which provide purpose and meaning in life. Indeed we may even be unable to achieve biophysical sustainability without engaging in the evolution of human consciousness at a collective level. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Since 1961, the Northeast Fisheries Science Center of the National Marine Fisheries Service has been conducting a study of the zooplankton of the US Northeast Shelf ecosystem. One of the objectives is to investigate ecological patterns of the system for any evidence of regime shifts and their effects on biodiversity and abundance of zooplankton and fish stocks. Two sampling strategies have been used: collections with Continuous Plankton Recorders beginning in 1961; and collections with bongo nets during the decade of MARMAP surveys (1977-1987), augmented by a time series of collections made during the autumn and spring groundfish surveys (1977-1993). The climate regime of the region leads to distinct and recurring seasonal pulses in zooplankton biomass and species succession in each of the four subareas of the shelf ecosystem distinguished. Evidence was detected in the analyses of inter-annual variability in species abundance and zooplankton biomass. However, no evidence of a large-scale regime shift of the magnitude described recently for other areas was detected From our analyses. Species shifts in abundance and the inter-annual and decadal variability observed in zooplankton biomass levels have allowed for sufficient residual sustainability in zooplankton biodiversity and abundance to support the recovery of depleted pelagic fish stocks.

DE animal production; livestock density; livestock farming systems
AB Sustainable animal production as applicable to small farm production system in Indian context has been discussed. Livestock farming systems practised are mainly traditional and guided by socio-economic considerations, available feed resources and market demand. The present status of livestock production and the contribution of livestock to Indian economy through milk, meat, egg, fibre and draught animal power (DAP) have been examined along with future perspectives. The major issues as related to animal production are (i) environmental degradation, (ii) low external input, (iii) impact of technologies on livestock improvement and resource base, and (iv) large number of ruminants and methane emission. Role and impact of technologies as related to animal health, breeding and reproduction, frozen semen, crossbreeding, feeds and feeding and institutional structure in improving livestock productivity and production have been examined. Effects of high livestock density, over grazing and desertification on natural resources and environment and that of large number of ruminants on global warming have been deliberated. Number of livestock specially cattle and buffalo, that can be sustained to meet the higher food needs, DAP, clean environment and maintenance of natural resources have been discussed. A sustainable model for higher productivity of livestock has been proposed.

AB In a world of sustainable energy supply, the latter will be predominantly generated, distributed and consumed in the form of electric power and hydrogen. In order to balance supply and demand, for storage purposes and to meet the specific requirements of the different end users, we need powerful energy transformers in both directions-fuel cells and electrolyzers.
   Though based upon a simple electrochemical effect, tough demands on a water splitter, with respect to efficiency, operability, safety and costs make it a modern electrolyzer and a piece of engineering excellence.
   Furthermore, the general aspects of electrolyzer design and performance will be discussed. (C) 1998 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.

TI Ergonomics in apple sorting: A pilot study
SO JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ENGINEERING RESEARCH

DT Article
ID POSTURE; TASKS
AB Ergonomic studies were made of sorters working on grading tables in a commercial apple packing shed in New Zealand. Trials were conducted to test whether the perceived comfort or physical discomfort (e.g. reported muscle pains) and performance of sorters could be altered by changes to the table design. Sorters were questioned about their level of comfort after working on two crossflow grading tables and a cascade table.
   Sorters preferred to work on a table designed so that the maximum forward reaching distance had been reduced from 1090 to 590 mm, and to sit rather than stand. Sorters working on tables with 900 mm wide rollers and a reject conveyor before them, spent a considerable part of their time stretching to reach fruit outside their sustainable work zone. The reported level of comfort was significantly greater when forward stretch was restricted (p < 0.001). Sorters also found the cascade sorter more comfortable than the cross-flow system. However, no conclusive results of the effects on sorter performance and physical discomfort were found. Sorters in the shed were mostly working at too low a height relative to the table at the start of the season, but by the end of the season, roughly half chose to use boards to raise them into an ergonomically better working position.

AB In order to engage in large-scale ecosystem management, natural resource managers must take into account the perceptions of citizens living in areas to be managed in a sustainable manner. Among other bases for perception, an individual's "sense of place" and beliefs connecting the self to a larger environment play pivotal roles in the process of attending to advocacy regarding natural resource policies. This study examines the perceptions of individuals living in the Lake Superior basin regarding their identification with a sense of place. Analysis of interview and survey data reveals that interviewees relate themselves to their region and environment primarily by way of "natural" and "social" features in their daily lives and that one's focus on either of the two dimensions, as well as their perceptions of various activities, is mediated by how long they have lived in the area. Implications for the development of ecosystem management communication campaigns are discussed.

AB We develop a dynamic model with optimizing private agents and a benevolent, optimizing monetary authority that cannot commit to future policies. We characterize the set of sustainable equilibria and discuss the implications for institutional reform. We show that there are equilibria in which the monetary authority pursues inflationary policies because that is what private agents expect. We call such equilibria expectation traps. Alternative institutional arrangements for the conduct of monetary policy which impose limited forms of commitment on the policymaker can eliminate expectation traps. (C) 1998 Academic Press.

AB Encroachment on rural land is a serious problem in developing countries, particularly in regions that are undergoing rapid economic development. Monitoring and simulating land conversions thus are critical to the formulation of a sustainable development strategy. This paper describes a computer-based approach for simulating land encroachment with fuzzy-logic-controlled cellular automata (CA). Unlike CA models developed in the domain of natural sciences, this simulation model seeks to integrate rule definition with explicit, interactive and heuristic decision-making processes. Fuzzy logic was used to capture the feature of land conversion behaviour while CA was to used to simulate global pattern from local rules and implemented in a geographical information system (GIS) using ARC/INFO software. By providing a series of simulation scenarios, the study reveals potential hazardous consequences inherent in some development policies that would jeopardize sustainable development of the region and demonstrates that this approach is a useful tool to provide decision support.

   HISTORY
AB The Quabbin forest of central Massachusetts; is the first barrier to contamination at the source of Boston's water supply. An interdisciplinary team is implementing an uneven-aged management strategy to create a watershed protection forest that both ensures water quality and enhances site productivity, biological diversity, and cultural resources. Adapting to changing conditions and learning from experience define this approach to interdisciplinary forestry. Recent green certification by SmartWood provided external review of the public forest's sustainability. Quabbin managers hope to lead local private landowners by their example.

AB This paper suggests an approach to life-cycle impact assessment which is based on the comparison of predicted exploitation or pollution levels with critical levels; the latter representing the carrying capacity of the commodity-supplying or pollutant-receiving environment. The incremental pressure induced by the product system is weighted with the total pressure on the reference environment. Geographic dimensions of the reference environment are chosen in accordance with the spatial sphere of influence of commodity extractions or pollutant emissions. The feasibility of the approach is shortly surveyed for a number of input-related and output-related impacts and the approach is compared with conventional Life-cycle impact assessment. It is concluded that life-cycle risk assessment may contribute to a better harmonization of methods for impact assessment. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

DE risk assessment; public perception; costs and benefits; uncertainties;
   harm; significance
AB Environmental protection and improvement comes at a price, and regulators must ensure that resources are targeted at the highest priority risks. Risk assessment at a strategic level is now an essential tool. Risks can arise from natural sources such as flooding and radon, as well as anthropogenic sources such as discharges of pollutants or the introduction of alien fish species. In deciding which environmental pressure to tackle next, and which to leave, regulators have to compare the full range of risks on a sound and consistent basis. Comparing risks from such diverse sources poses a significant challenge and traditional hazard assessments are now no longer sufficient. Consideration now needs to be given to a much wider range of factors if risk assessment is to be used as an aid to strategic decision-making. In general, Strategic Risk Assessment can be broken down into four main tasks. (i) Harm assessment-where the impact of a given level of exposure on a predefined receptor group is determined. (ii) Risk significance-where the harm evaluated in (i) is placed in the geographical (regional, national international) context in relation to the overall population of receptors, and the range of different receptors. (iii) Risk uncertainty-where the probability of occurrence, exposure and harm is quantified together with the range of uncertainties involved in the overall assessment. (iv) Risk importance-where the costs and benefits of various actions/options together with a measure of society's view of the risk are brought together. All the above have been included in the Strategic Risk Assessment Methodology which has been developed by the Environment Agency, and will be used to direct the organisation's manpower and financial resources to maximise its contribution to sustainable development.

AB The work deals with the creation of an experimental model of integrated planning based on the principles of sustainable development. The analysis and planning of the built environment focus on the improvement, reclaiming and requalifying of the urban environment and the protection of the landscape. The methodology combines the assessment of the natural risk of a territory with the process of mapping the area via a structured inheritance semantic system (SI Nets) which aims to determine, in detail, the capacity of land use. The application of the GIS system has been confirmed at the different levels of territorial planning. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The issue is addressed whether assistance to persons in need can be left to the 'family' and the 'community'. In that case people depend on their social networks. The support a person receives through a given network of social ties is examined. However, ties are diverse and subject to change. By means of a model of the dynamics of social ties, the conditions for adequate private support are analyzed. The sustainability of private support over time is examined by incorporating the impact on social ties of lending and receiving support. It is shown that support is only an effective alternative in a limited number of situations.

AB A conceptual model is presented as a guide to the maintenance and restoration of ecologically sustainable boreal forest. The model is based on the hypothesis that self-sustained forest ecosystems can be (re-)created, and their biodiversity developed, if forest management can simulate the composition and structure of boreal forest landscapes by introducing and maintaining disturbances leading to naturally dynamic spatial and temporal patterns of forest regeneration.
   The major explanatory variable in the model is the effect of wildfire on sites with different fuel characteristics and climates found in the European boreal forest. Four levels of fire intensity are distinguished, based on mean fire frequencies. These range from extremely low in some wet tall-herb sites or sites at high altitudes or latitudes with a humid climate, where fire is absent or rare, to dry lichen-rich sites where fire occurs often. The model is called ASIO, after the words Absent, Seldom, Infrequent and Often, indicating the four levels.
   Three main disturbance regimes are distinguished in the European boreal forest, based on the complex interactions between probabilistic (e.g. mean fire intervals at different site types) and random events (e.g. where and when a fire occurs): (1) gap-phase Picea abies dynamics; (2) succession from young to old-growth mixed deciduous/coniferous forest; and (3) multi-cohort Pinus sylvestris dynamics. The model stems mainly from studies in Fennoscandia, but some studies from outside this region are reviewed to provide support for a more general application of the model.
   The model has been implemented in planning systems on the landscape level of several large Swedish forest enterprises, and is also used as an educational tool to help private land owners with the location and realization of forest management regimes. Finally, the model can be used to develop an administrative system for the monitoring of biodiversity in boreal forest.

DT Article
AB The U.K. personal lines insurance industry has changed significantly over the last few years, as a result of new entrants, new technology and changing customer expectations. This article describes how AA insurance, the largest personal lines intermediary in the U.K., has responded to these changes and after a period of weakness has arrested decline to emerge as a company outperforming its sector. The authors firmly believe that in a change programme of this nature it is only by looking at the impact from the individual employee's point of view, as well as the organization's, that a transformation can be realised.

ID NEPAL
AB The paper reviews experiences of the Doon Valley Integrated Watershed Management Project, with emphasis on the evolution of a participatory "process orientated" approach aimed at developing community capabilities to sustain the increased natural resource production systems introduced by Project activities. The focus is on promoting convergent planning and strengthening the skills and institutional capacities of the rural communities, as well as of the government agency responsible for implementation. The major conclusions are: (1) that human resource development should precede external technical watershed management activities; (2) that under the participatory approach, external implementers need to be encouraged to merge their technical skills with the indigenous skills of villagers in order to achieve a convergent approach. The initial focus of watershed management projects should be on communities and the adjacent areas under their influence, rather than on the physical aspects of watersheds. Women proved to be most receptive and capable of forming cohesive groups to manage natural resources, with livelihood-generation as the primary trigger. Actual priorities perceived by villagers through participatory (PRA-based) planning frequently differ from "targets" and priorities defined by outside planners. Conventional watershed management activities are rarely perceived by villagers as priorities, creating frustration for the external implementers and demanding flexibility in inputs, budgets, and phasing. The project produced initial improvements in living conditions and in local involvement by people in managing natural resources. This was supplemented by physical soil and water conservation measures and community-managed grass and fodder tree plantations. The consequent reduction in pressure on intervening forest areas should favor natural eco-regeneration. Moreover, the increased environmental awareness and involvement of the villagers is expected to facilitate protection of afforestation programs beyond the village limits.

AB The diversity and extent of forest in the Itombwe Mountains, eastern Congo Democratic Republic (formerly Zaire), are among the most significance in continental Africa. Despite some human impact, this area still harbors a wide range of vegetation types, including forests and grasslands, drylands and wetlands, and mid-altitude to upper-montane habitats. Forests extend from mid-altitude through sub-montane and montane to alpine zones. These first results provide a general description of the Itombwe Mountains as a basis for more detailed investigations. Certain priorities in conservation-development actions are suggested, based mainly on tree species knowledge; this information could influence further decision-making processes and management guidelines for the conservation and sustainable use of Itombwe's natural resources.

AB At the recent UN climate change convention in Kyoto, the EU countries agreed to a further reduction in their CO2 emissions of 8% by 2010, Although the new Sizewell B generator and improvements to other British nuclear plant have helped to ensure that earlier targets have been met, the lack of any planned replacement nuclear generation means that to achieve this new target Britain will need to focus on improving energy efficiency, reducing energy consumption and developing other renewable energy sources as the older stations reach the end of their economic lives. This paper reviews the UK's challenges in a global context and proposes a basis for a national sustainable energy policy with regard to electricity generation. In particular, it calls for the government to encourage development of further nuclear and tidal power stations, including the proposed Severn barrage.

AB How do governments react to the accumulation of debt? Do they take corrective measures, or do they let the debt grow? Whereas standard time series tests cannot reject a unit root in the U. S. debt-GDP ratio, this paper provides evidence of corrective action: the U. S. primary surplus is an increasing function of the debt-GDP ratio. The debt-GDP ratio displays mean-reversion if one controls for war-time spending and for cyclical fluctuations. The positive response of the primary surplus to changes in debt also shows that U. S. fiscal policy is satisfying an intertemporal budget constraint.

AB Farming practices and their implications for the environment have come under increasing scrutiny in recent years with mounting pressures on farmers to reduce pollution and achieve higher environmental standards. The Nitrates Directive is an outstanding example, at EU level, of the pressure on farmers to redirect agriculture toward greater sustainability. This paper examines the implementation process of the Nitrates Directive in Spain, analysing the causes of the delay in implementing the directive, and examining farmers' views of nitrate pollution and their attitudes toward environmental regulation of their activity.

AB This article presents the results of a study conducted in two phases within a single industry context. The first phase involved comparative case studies to ground the applicability of the resource-based view of the firm within the domain of environmental responsiveness. The second phase involved testing the relationships observed during the case studies through a mail survey. It was found that strategies of proactive responsiveness to the uncertainties inherent at the interface between the business and ecological issues were associated with the emergency of unique organizational capabilities. These capabilities, in turn, were seen to have implications for firm competitiveness. (C) 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB While cooperative buyer-supplier relations are an important source of sustainable competitive advantage, noncooperative behavior persists widely. This paper tests a model incorporating noncooperative behavior within a context of formal commitment, using data form the U.S. auto industry. This 'close, but adversarial' model appears to be reasonably well supported by the data, suggesting that even within professed cooperative buyer-supplier relationships adversarial behavior persists. In contrast, a small but significant minority of the relationships were found to be characterized by high levels of trust as well as informal commitment. The results suggest specific strategies for developing cooperative supplier relations. (C) 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI A meta-analytical evaluation of sustainable city initiatives
SO URBAN STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
AB The role of the city in environmental management is increasingly coming to the fore. A central element in creating urban environmental sustainability is the adoption of appropriate energy policies, since most environmental externalities in cities are directly or indirectly related to energy use, The current practice demonstrates an overwhelming variety of initiatives and policies, so that the actual success of such strategies in a cross-sectional comparative perspective is hard to evaluate. In this context, this paper offers an application of meta-analysis, as this approach is an interesting analytical contribution towards a better understanding of the critical success factors of urban energy policies. The paper starts with a general overview of the issue of urban sustainability and sets out the importance of energy policies at the urban level. It continues by offering a methodological framework for the assessment of critical factors related to the performance of sustainable energy strategies. Using a database containing information on experiences and expert expectations regarding renewable energy initiatives in 12 European cities spread over 3 countries (Italy, The Netherlands and Greece), we offer a cross-European comparative analysis of the performance of urban renewable energy technologies. This comparative analysis consists of a statistical explanation based on a probit analysis of urban sustainability data and the application of a specific meta-analytical method, called rough set analysis. The paper ends with a concluding section on policy lessons.

AB Using data from long-term experiments at the Loess-Chernozem site, Bad Lauchstadt und 12 other European sites, the carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) dynamics in soils, the determination of decomposable soil organic matter (SOM), the effect on yield of SOM as well as carbon and nitrogen balances are discussed. Both C and N in SOM have to be divided into an inert and a decomposable fraction. the inert C is strongly correlated with clay content, while most changes in both C and N occur in the readily decomposable fraction. In the experiments considered the latter ranges between 0.2 to 0.6% C and 0.02 to 0.06% N. The annual changes of the C-org content amount only to about 0.01% C-org corresponding to 500 kg/ha, even under extreme changes of the fertilizing system.
   Hot water extractable C(C-hwe) has proved to be an appropriate criterion for the calculation of the decomposable C and thus for the N release from soil. different methods to maintain a SOM balance are compared and first guideline values for an agronomically and ecologically justified SOM content of arable soils are recommended. In arable soils the exceeding of an upper C-org value influences neither crop yield nor the C and N balance in a positive way. In terms of ecology and environment, set-aside-programmes or fallows in a crop rotation affect the balances negatively. Atmospheric N deposition can amount to about 50 kg/ha.yr.

AB The reform process in India has not encountered much resistance from pressure groups because it has nor made much headway in respect of debureaucratising and de-politicising the management of the infrastructure and in decentralising rural development. In particular implementation of radical land reforms at the very start would have resulted in speedy demographic transition and effective trickle down mechanisms, as was the case in some of the east Asian countries. In India since redistribution of land by further lowering the legal ceiling on landholdings is not politically feasible and implementation of top-dawn subsidy-oriented poverty alleviation programmes is not-likely,to be effective, economic and-social empowerment of the poor has to be achieved basically through productive employment and human development. This requires rapid broad-based labour-intensive growth.

AB Sustainable development has for a long time been considered the starting-point for environmental policy, with Agenda 21 leading the way to such development. Social and economic equity, as well as global efficiency and development, are considered among the requirements for sustainable development. Only when such development is reached, will the solution to environmental problems come into perspective. Although we are now 5 years along the road marked out by Agenda 21, the perspectives for achieving the objectives stated are still slight. Despite economic growth, global inequity is on the increase. The conversion of natural areas to agricultural land will greatly increase due to the population growth, especially in Asia and Africa. In North America and Europe this trend seems reversed: life expectancy is longer and people's health has improved. The developing world is catching up. However, there is more needed to bring the world population's welfare and social security levels up to par. At the same time the environmental pressures on the world's natural areas will have to be brought down substantially. This can be done using market-based instruments, supplemented where necessary with orders, bans, fiscal measures and agreements at national and international levels. Internationally, a policy directed to investments and trade is needed to stimulate developing regions to undertake technological renewal and work away backlogs. The technological potential is still gigantic, but investment in the social system - in other words, in people - will be necessary if we are actually to use this potential.

AB Ever since the Earth Summit was launched at Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in 1992, the concept of sustainability has exerted significant influence on policy at local level. Sustainable urban development has also become an important local strategy for global sustainability. Due to their integrative and forward-looking characteristics, sustainability indicators have been proposed to measure and evaluate urban development. After discussing the ecological economic dimension of urban sustainability, this paper presents a procedure and a conceptual framework of the indicator system for measuring Taipei's urban sustainability. On the basis of natural processes and evolving urban development, the approach to Taipei's sustainable development is defined as reinforcing Taipei's metropolitan life-support system through its economic vitality for enhancing Taipei's urban productivity and quality and making Taipei a national capital with blue-green characteristics. Based on the conceptual framework of urban ecological economic system, 80 indicators are selected through participation of non-governmental organizations (NGOs), which can be used as policy-making indicators for measuring Taipei's urban sustainability. The policy-making indicators are further aggregated into 10 general public indicators and evaluated using signal lights (green, yellow and red). It is concluded that the proposed indicator system can provide evidence of progress on urban sustainability. Justification of public expenditure on urban development can therefore be evaluated.

AB Birth-pulse populations are often characterized with discrete-time models, that use a single function to relate the post-breeding population size to the post-breeding size of the previous year. Recently, models of seasonal density dependence have been constructed that emphasize interactions during shorter time periods also. Here, we study two very simple forms of density-dependent mortality, that lead to Ricker and Beverton-Holt type population dynamics when viewed over the whole year. We explore the consequences of harvest timing to equilibrium population sizes under such density dependence. Whether or not individual mortality compensates for the harvested quota, the timing of harvesting has a strong impact on the sustainability of a harvesting quota. Further, we show that careless discretization of a continuous mortality scheme may seriously underestimate the reduction in population size caused by hunting and overestimate the sustainable yield. We also introduce the concept of the demographic value of an individual, which reflects the expected contribution to population size over time in the presence of density dependence. Finally, we discuss the possibility of calculating demographic values as means of optimizing harvest strategies. Here, a Pareto optimal harvest strategy will minimize the loss of demographic value from the population for a given yield. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Surface charge dissipation on insulator surfaces can reduce local charging potentials thereby preventing ion trajectory deflection at the bottom of trenches that leads to lateral sidewall etching (notching). We perform detailed Monte Carlo simulations of pattern-dependent charging during etching in high-density plasmas with the maximum sustainable surface electric field as a parameter. Significant notching occurs for a threshold electric field as low as 0.5 MV/cm or 50 V/mu m, which is reasonable for the surface of good insulators. The results support pattern-dependent charging as the leading cause of notching and suggest that the problem will disappear as trench widths are reduced. (C) 1998 American Institute of Physics.

AB To analyse human influences on rural landscapes in present-day central and northern Europe and also to investigate sustainable landscape development concepts, an IALE (International Association for Landscape Ecology) regional Conference on 'Perspectives of Rural Landscapes in Europe' was held in Parnu, Estonia on 20-27 June 1996. The conference was undertaken specifically to exchange information between planners, managers, decision makers and scientists in the region. In the last few years, rural landscapes in Europe have changed significantly. Due to restructuring of agriculture in the European Union (EU) countries and radical socio-economic changes in eastern and central Europe, landscape change will continue. This stimulates interest for landscape ecologists to study the processes connected with such rapid development and to analyse its socioeconomic and ecological consequences. Different conference findings that resulted from six keynote speeches, 33 oral presentations, 21 posters and organised excursions (I-day conference excursion and 4-day post-conference excursion) are presented here. Thirteen papers published as part of this special issue of Landscape and Urban Planning, and summarised here, deal with general and methodological principles of the analysis of land use changes and related landscape evaluation, and also present case studies on land use changes from Estonia, Germany and Sweden.

ID LAND EVALUATION
AB The goal of a sustainable land use and landscape development can only be reached by re-establishing regulation functions. That is why it is necessary to assess such a function besides others (production, carrier, information) to derive different potentials for various parts of landscape properties and to promote these potentials by introducing relevant measures. A first step in this direction is to assess profoundly how capable landscape units are. Regarding landscape units as areas of assessment they have to be constant for a long time, especially along their boundaries. As land use changes profoundly on a large scale, landscape units have to be separated on a regional scale. Thinking in geographic dimensions it is the chronological level we have to work on. Unfortunately, there are no assessment methods for landscape functions in this dimension. Due to the fact that all traditional assessment procedures are only valid for small areas it is necessary to look for methods that are of value for larger areas too. The use of fuzzy set methods and fuzzy logic seems to be promising. Traditional assessment methods are taken and combined with fuzzy set theory to get results for larger landscape units. Taking the function of ground water protection as an example the method is exemplarily described and applied on landscape units in the agglomeration area of Leipzig-Halle in the central part of Eastern Germany. Finally, a suggestion for the cartographic implementation is given. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Four organic (biodynamic) farms coupled with conventional farms from their neighbourhood in The Netherlands, Germany and Sweden, and 3 organic farms and 4 conventional farms from the West Friesean region in The Netherlands were evaluated to compare their impact on landscape diversity. Materials used were soil-, water-, land use- and land-property maps, interviews with the farmers, repeated (several days) visits to the farms, allowing to make temporal transects, photographs and pictures of the farm-couples and their surroundings. Presence of diverse land use types, woody elements (plantings) and visual elements (vertical and horizontal coherence, colours and forms) were analysed. The results show that the diversity of landscapes and farming system was greater in organic farms. It regards to the land-use types, crops, livestock, plantings (hedges, solitary shrubs and trees), flora, sensorial information (more forms, colours, smells, sounds, spatial experiences) and labour (more on-farm processing and more people involved). Also, all forms of coherence were found to be greater in organic farms. In terms of landscape diversity the organic types of agriculture have a good potential for positive contributions to a sustainable agro-landscape management.

ID EUROPEAN LANDSCAPES
AB The Convention on Biodiversity (CBD) of the UN Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED in Rio 1992) presents a main challenge for the development of regional strategies for biodiversity conservation. If it is to be adopted politically, then targets will have to be based on reliable documentation of the biotic 'ingredients' of the different landscape systems and moreover, targets have to be adapted to the regional socio-economic systems. Landscape systems were delineated which are representative of the sequence of different land use and impact intensities in central Europe. In a first test, these systems were characterized by generally available biological and socio-economic data, in order to identify the conservation performance of the dominant central European landscape systems. The results of this approach will be discussed with respect to restoration needs, preservation measures and development proposals for the different central European landscape systems. It can be shown that special attention for biodiversity conservation in central Europe has to be paid to the urban/suburban landscapes because of their high biological diversity i.e. coverage of important sites for nature conservation and species richness. In addition, the coupling of the floristic data with a scheme of reproduction times for vegetation formations and habitat types, helps to outline different packages of conservation action plans for sustainable regional development.

ID LONG-TERM TILLAGE; ORGANIC-MATTER; NITROGEN; CARBON; ROTATION; EROSION
AB Soils in semi-arid regions are highly susceptible to soil organic matter (SOM) loss when cultivated because of erratic yield, removal of crop residue for feed or fuel, uncontrolled soil erosion, and frequent fallowing to increase water storage. It is important to quantify the effect of each factor to be able to identify agoecosystems that are sustainable and recognize the management practices that best sequester C in soil. We identified changes in SOM in long-term experiments, some dating from the early 1900s, by evaluating tillage and crop rotation effects at several locations in semi-arid regions of the US Pacific Northwest. The major factors influencing changes in organic C and N were the frequency of summer-fallow and the amount of C input by crop residue. Soil erosion was low in long-term studies, but even limited soil loss can have a substantial impact on C and N levels if allowed over many years. Yearly crop production is recommended because any cropping system that included summer-fallow lost SOM over time without large applications of manure. We conclude that most of the SOM loss was due to high biological oxidation and absence of C input during the fallow year rather than resulting from erosion. Decreasing tillage intensity reduced SOM loss, but the effect was not as dramatic as eliminating summer-fallow. Crop management practices such as N fertilization increased residue production and improved C and N levels in soil. SOM can be maintained or increased in most semi-arid soils if they are cropped every year, crop residues are returned to soil, and erosion is kept to a minimum. SOM loss may be more intense in the Pacific Northwest because fallowing keeps the soil moist during the summer months when it would normally be dry. Our experiments identify two primary deficiencies of long-term studies to measure C sequestering capability: (1) soil C loss can be partitioned between erosion and biological oxidation only by estimation, and (2) C changes occurring below 30 cm in grassland soils cannot be quantified in many instances because samples were not collected.

TI Disease surveillance at district level: a model for developing countries
SO LANCET
LA English
DT Article
AB For over a decade we have maintained within a district of 5 million people, a system of prompt reporting of cases of childhood vaccine-preventable diseases, encephalitis, meningitis, hepatitis, and rabies; together with a sentinel laboratory surveillance of cholera, typhoid fever, malaria, HIV infection and antimicrobial-resistance patterns of selected pathogens. The system combined government and private sectors, with every hospital enrolled and participating. Reports were scanned daily on a computer for any clustering of cases. Interventions included investigations, immunisation, antimicrobial treatment, health education, and physical rehabilitation of children with paralysis. All vaccine-preventable diseases have declined markedly, whilst malaria and HIV infections have increased steadily. Annual expense was less than one US cent per head. The reasons for the success and sustainability of this model include simplicity or reporting procedure, low budget, private-sector participation, personal rapport with people in the network, regular feedback of information through a monthly bulletin, and the visible interventions consequent upon reporting. This district-level disease surveillance model is replicable in developing countries for evaluating polio eradication efforts, monitoring immunisation programmes, detecting outbreaks of old or new diseases, and for evaluating control measures.

TI Rice-wheat crop system in Indo-Gangetic region - Issues concerning
   sustainability
SO ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL WEEKLY
LA English
DT Article
AB Some agricultural experts have expressed the apprehension that the emergence of rice-wheat rotation crop system as a post-green revolution phenomenon has resulted in waterlogging, soil salinity and over-exploitation of the natural resource base. Moreover, it is argued that short time duration between rice-wheat crop rotation has led to sub-optimal land preparation and sub-optimal use of other inputs, causing reduction in yield of rice and wheat. While refuting any plateauing or stagnation in yield of rice and wheat, this paper nevertheless suggests that besides technological improvement, strengthening infrastructural facilities and initiating better land and water management through participatory approach can go some way in addressing the problems confronting the rice-wheat system in the Indo-Gangetic region.

TI Watershed development programmes in India - Emerging issues for
   environment-development perspectives
SO ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL WEEKLY
LA English
DT Article
AB Conservation of rain water and checking soil erosion is central to the attainment of economic as well as financial sustainability of dryland agriculture. Integrated Watershed Development Programme is the major policy instrument for achieving this goal. The approach, though quite comprehensive, however, has come at a time when the global environmental concerns have become quite strong. In turn, this has exerted significant influence in changing the central thrust as well as the composition of watershed development programmes in India. It is the contention of this paper that the global environmental concerns have diverted attention for productivity concerns and therby resorting to some of the softer options emphasising indigenous technology, low cost measures and participatory institutional development. It is argued that external forces have deviated the policies front making substantial investments in land which farmers otherwise cannot afford to make on their own. Also, a participatory approach for project implementation, per se, may not bring desired results in terms of enhancement of productivity and livelihood security. Finally, given the options, farmers prefer yield augmenting technologies and are willing to pay for the cost. This in turn also helps bringing more effective (interactive)participation in the SWC-programme.

TI Assessing the historical frequency of drought events on grazing

SO AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
ID MANAGEMENT
AB Using a simulation model of sheep and cattle grazing systems in different regions of the Australian rangelands, we tested the use of different measures and analyses for identifying an 'exceptional circumstances' drought event, defined as occurring once in 20 years in the long term. Over the century-long simulations, all measures (rainfall, various soil moisture measures, pasture growth, liveweight gain and an economic productivity index) identified the major drought periods in each region. However, the measures differed considerably in the identification of marginal events, because economic and biological hardship are not always synchronised. Total soil moisture seems to be the best single measure, providing it is properly calculated, but there is a strong case for considering more than one measure. Periods perceived as exceptional are also greatly affected by the choice of averaging technique, moving window, and assumptions about baseline management strategies. Hence the choice of index has implications for sustainability. We also show that revocation criteria are as important as the criteria for declaring a drought, and discuss the difficult balance between objectivity and equity. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Irrigation efficiency as a standard engineering measure has been traditionally used to assess water use management. Allocative efficiency as applied in production economics theory provides an alternative measure of irrigation performance. Both concepts are used in this study to investigate water efficiency levels for irrigated crops in the Batinah region of Oman under modern irrigation methods. While irrigation efficiency focuses on the technical aspect of water management, allocative efficiency is more directed to the economic aspects and has bearing on the economic sustainability of the system. Both estimates of irrigation efficiency and allocative efficiency show the presence of inefficiencies as a result of underuse of water resources. In a few cases, however, allocative efficiency show the possibility of overuse of irrigation water which could be the result of small-sized farms using water more extensively.

AB In a long-term field trial in northwestern Switzerland, the effects of organic and conventional land-use management on earthworm populations and on soil erodibility were investigated. A silt loam soil which had developed in deep deposits of alluvial loess characterised the study site. Three methods were applied to analyse soil erodibility, at three different periods between autumn 1992 and 1993: aggregate stability (measured in the laboratory by a high energy rainfall simulation and by percolation) and soil particle detachment (measured in the field by splash erosion). Earthworm biomass and density, as well as the population diversity, were significantly greater on the organic plots than on the conventional plots. Likewise, the aggregate stability of the organic plots, when determined by means of percolation, was significantly better. Therefore, erosion susceptibility is greater on plots farmed conventionally. On the other hand, splash erosion monitoring and simulated rainfall experiments only partially highlight differences in erodibility between the two main land-management methods. Future comparisons between the farming systems should also include farmer managed fields with greater differentiation in crop rotations and cultural practices like tillage, fertilisation and pesticide use.

AB The rubric of sustainable development has now gained wide theoretical and political acceptance in the global community. However, after the Rio Declaration, each nation must now confront the specific question of how to decide between those industries and activities that are sustainable and those that are not when conflicting social and ecological interests are at stake. Any fundamental change to resource allocation will have social distributional consequences, and the issue of justice therefore becomes a critical element of any sustainability formulation. This paper contributes to this debate by exploring the potential for a politically grounded theory of justice in and to the environment. More specifically, we argue for a situated analysis that nevertheless retains the postulate of a neo-Kantian universal ethic as the foundation for,global institutions that could integrate and safeguard the principles of justice and ecological responsibility underpinning most notions of sustainability. We show this by locating the question of justice in a particular conflict of interest, that between the Australian mining giant Broken Hill Proprietary, Ltd., and the traditional landowners of an area on the Ok Tedi river in Papua New Guinea.

AB 1. Traditional, parallel approaches to ecological and environmental monitoring of UK rivers have produced a coincident series of field survey, classification and evaluation methods. Each method has been developed for a specific purpose, but most include a common set of recorded attributes.
   2. The recent move towards integrated river basin management, which supports the principles of sustainable development and enhancing biodiversity, provides a unifying purpose for classifying and evaluating rivers.
   3. Agreed technical standards, protocols and terminologies are basic requirements needed to ensure that there is greater collective use of data and to encourage convergence of classification and evaluation methods as aids to more efficient integrated river basin management.

AB 1. This paper sets out the background to river channel classification using geomorphological features; these are highly relevant to the description and understanding of physical habitat.
   2. The River Habitat Survey (RHS) database contains much geomorphological information which has been statistically analysed for those semi-natural sites surveyed in 1994. Additional geomorphological data have been gathered in an attempt to make the resulting typology 'dynamic', i.e. capable of predicting channel stability, an important component of the information needed for sustainable river management.
   3. The outcome of TWINSPAN and redundancy analyses is disappointing in statistical terms and does not, therefore, constitute an objective taxonomy. However, the river types selected by the analyses are intuitively realistic, and show promise that, with a broader database (both spatially and in terms of independent variables) the development of a predictive, dynamic typology will be possible.

AB For the first time, a paper delivered at the Annual Nuclear Conference was presented by two authors, the CEO of Bayernwerk AG, Dr. Otto Majewski, and the CEO of the Power Generation Division (KWU) of Siemens AG, Adolf Huttl, reflecting the operators' and the vendors' points of view about the present situation of nuclear power use in Germany and the need to maintain its share in the energy mix. The events associated with shipments of casks for radioactive waste have rekindled the debate about the responsibility of the peaceful use of nuclear power in the nuclear opposition camp. That debate needs to be put back on a factual basis. If no consensus could be achieved now about the use of nuclear power as a whole, at least consensus had to be reached about the future approach to spent fuel and waste management.
   From the outset, the nuclear industry has shown a high degree of responsibility, developing concepts of using uranium as an energy source in an economically viable and responsible way. It is showing responsibility also in making provision for the future. The safe and economically successful operation of today's nuclear power plants is an important reason for developing new reactor concepts. That development of new reactor lines depends critically on the preservation and advancement of specialized knowledge. Know-how needs to be preserved and developed further not only for future nuclear power plants but also for the plants existing now, which still have service lives of several decades. Sustainable energy supply requires ail sources of energy to be exploited, especially those which do not generate carbon dioxide. All the options currently known must be kept open and preserved, respectively, for coming generations. Acting responsibly means adding to the choices available.

ID DEGRADATION
AB Over the next thirty years, it has been predicted that worldwide markets for environmental technology will exceed $400 billion annually. These markets are extremely broad and are encompassed by a vision of environmental sustainability. Within this vision, environmental biotechnology can play a distinct role. Yet, this role is not clearly defined and the market share that environmental biotechnology call capture remains unpredictable. What is clear, is that environmental biotechnology has opportunities to contribute new solutions and directions in remediation of contaminated environments, minimizing future waste release and creating pollution prevention alternatives. To take advantage of these opportunities, innovative new strategies, which advance the use of molecular biological methods and genetic engineering technology, must be developed. These methods would improve the understanding of existing biological processes in order to increase their efficiency, productivity, and flexibility. Examples of the development and implementation of such strategies include: 1) the use of recombinant organisms in soil bioremediation, 2) generic and molecular process monitoring and control for optimization of waste treatment systems, bioprocessing and bioremediation, and 3) novel gene discovery technology and wireless integrated circuit biosensor biotechnology for direct environmental analysis, and system improvement. While the research and development landscape is expected to shift from bioremediation technology to more complex topics in environmental sustainability, the resulting transition creates enormous opportunities for innovative biotechnical approaches to capture a significant share of the future environmental technology market.

AB A survey on trade in live wild animals was conducted along the Guangxi border between China and Vietnam during 1993-1996. The results showed that there were 55 species, which were underestimated, involved in the trade, including 15 species of mammals, 10 species of birds, 29 species of reptiles and 1 species of amphibian. Many of them were species listed on Appendices I and II of CITES and on China's protection list (known as ASSP). During the investigation, about 2.29-29.325 tons of wildlife per day were imported to China form Vietnam. Some species with a large volume of trade may be over-exploited. Sixty-three percent of middle-high quality restaurants in three border cities and Nanning in Guangxi sold wildlife foods. Twenty kinds of wild animals were eaten at the restaurants. Although numbers of species involved in the trade remained fairly stable over the survey period, numbers of species listed in Appendices I and II of CITES and the state protection list had declined. The scale of wildlife markets in border cities of Guangxi and consumption levels of wildlife in the restaurants had been reduced because border control measures were enforced on the trade by local governments of China. However, the prices of the 5 main species in wildlife markets were still going up. This suggested that demand for wildlife in Guangxi was strong and will facilitate the illegal trade. The key steps to control the illegal wildlife trade between the two countries should focus on (i) suppression of illegal wildlife markets and prohibition of the sale of wildlife food in restaurants consisting of species listed in the ASSP inventory; (ii) international cooperation in the control of the trade; (iii) tighter enforcement of CITES for both countries; (iv) control of invasion of exotic species and epidemics of disease in the trade in China; and (v) education for wildlife conservation in China.

AB The sustainable conservation of diversity in riverine wetlands implies knowledge of the basic geomorphological and ecological processes that inter play at the landscape scale. Eight hypothetical types of wetlands, predicted as differing in their plant communities, were proposed by combination of three factors (geomorphological pattern, river incision vs aggradation, groundwater origin), selected because they determine the effects of flood disturbances (intensity, frequency) and the water supplies. This hypothesis was tested through the comparison of the vegetation and the physico-chemistry of cut-off channels of the Ain River in France. Cutoff meanders were related to meso-eutraphent plant species of standing water, aggraded meanders being more frequently overflowed than incised ones. Braided channels were characterized by flood-tolerant species, some of the incised ones being related to oligotraphent communities, but some remaining connected, through seepage and floods, to the river (mesotraphent species). The ratio of side-hill aquifer to seepage supplying these channels depends on river vs aquifer levels but also on their elevation from the river level, determined by their age. The study demonstrates the effect of geomorphology and of water supplies on floristic assemblages, but some other features must also be considered. The high diversity of functioning implies that conservation of such ecosystems should consider all the parts of the river landscape and all the processes that interfere on several time-scales.

AB Contributors to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) generally agree that increases in the atmospheric concentration of greenhouse trace gases (i.e., CO(2), CH(4), N(2)O, O(3)) since preindustrial times, about the year 1750, have led to changes in the earth's climate. During the past 250 years the atmospheric concentrations of CO(2), CH(4), and N(2)O have increased by 30, 145, and 15%, respectively. A doubling of preindustrial CO(2) concentrations by the end of the twenty-first century is expected to raise global mean surface temperature by about 2 degrees C and increase the frequency of severe weather events. These increases are attributed mainly to fossil fuel use, land-use change, and agriculture. Soils and climate changes are related by bidirectional interactions. Soil processes directly affect climatic changes through the production and consumption of CO(2), CH(4), and N(2)O and, indirectly, through the production and consumption of NH,, NO,, and CO. Although CO(2) is primarily produced through fossil fuel combustion, land-use changes, conversion of forest and grasslands to agriculture, have contributed significantly to atmospheric increase of CO(2). Changes in land use and management can also result in the net uptake, sequestration, of atmospheric CO(2). CH(4) and N(2)O are produced (30% and 70%, respectively) in the soil, and soil processes will likely regulate future changes in the atmospheric concentration of these gases. The soil-atmosphere exchange of CO(2), CH(4), and N(2)O are interrelated, and changes in one cycle can im part changes in the N cycle and resulting soil-atmosphere exchange of N(2)O. Conversely, N addition increases C sequestration. On the other hand, soil processes are influenced by climatic change through imposed changes in soil temperature, soil water, and nutrient competition. Increasing concentrations of atmospheric CO(2) alters plant response to environmental parameters and frequently results in increased efficiency in use of N and water. In annual crops increased CO(2) generally leads to increased crop productivity. In natural systems, the long-term impact of increased CO(2) on ecosystem sustainability is not known. These changes may also-result in altered CO(2), CH(4), and N(2)O exchange with the soil. Because of large temporal and spatial variability in the soil-atmosphere exchange of trace gases, the measurement of the absolute amount and prediction of the changes of these fluxes, as they are impacted by global change on regional and global scales, is still difficult. in recent years, however, much progress has been made in decreasing the uncertainty of field scale flux measurements, and efforts are being directed to large scale field and modeling programs. This paper briefly relates soil process and issues akin to the soil-atmosphere exchange of CO(2), CH(4), and N(2)O. The impact of climate change, particularly increasing atmospheric CO(2) concentrations, on soil processes is also briefly discussed.

AB Information networks enable a permanently developing exchange of information - a multilogue - among the relevant actors of policy processes aiming at sustainability. The paper discusses problems and potentials of these networks and the importance of information and communication technologies in the strategic design of environmental policy. It describes the role of science and of knowledge in general in information society. Special attention is paid to the questions how farmers should be tied up to the multilogue and with which additional knowledge they should be supplied to improve their ability to include requirements of sustainability into their decisions. The multilogue could support farmers in fulfilling their responsibility towards the environment, thus bringing advantages for agricultural policy as well.

AB "Sustainable Development" is a triple vision: preservation of the energy resources and protection of the environment, achievement of social values and justice within the present and for future generations, as well as sustainable economic development. The energy industry can make a major contribution to the achievement of this vision by making energy available to a growing world population on a secured, reasonably priced and environmentally compatible Long-term basis. The awareness to live in an indivisible world is the basic prerequisite for the energy industry to become a driving force of a sustainable economic, social and ecologic development. In this concert the energy industry needs to rely on government framework conditions promoting this development.

DT Article
AB Some population characteristics of a little known mole crab Hippa adactyla Fabricius from the sandy intertidal habitat of Kavaratti atoll, Lakshadweep islands, were studied for understanding the resource potentials besides some features of breeding behavior. The study is based on the detailed examination of 1140 specimens collected from the intertidal beach during November 1993. The specimens were in the size range of 8.84-22.56 mm carapace length (CL). The population of mole crab consisted of three modal size classes, dominated by the newly recruited or the '0' year individuals. The size at maturity of female crabs (estimated from the smallest egg bearing females) was 10.14 mm CL. The egg bearing population constituted more than 60% of the total observed specimens of mole crab, and over 80% of the 'I' and 'II' year population carried eggs. Mean fecundity was estimated to be 1628.61 +/- 853.13 eggs/female/clutch, with a large variation in the total number of eggs per female. Regression analysis of fecundity with length and weight (wet weight) revealed that fecundity correlated better with length (r = 0.86) than weight (r = 0.82). However, the differences between regression values were insignificant. This mole crab species possess great potential for commercial exploitation especially in oceanic environment, like Lakshadweep islands, where food resources are limited. The information on the population parameters provided here therefore would be useful for sustainable exploitation.

AB Variation among individuals in specific growth rate (SGR), feeding, and two measures of swimming performance and their possible interrelationships were investigated in juvenile rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) kept in groups on either satiation or half-satiation rations. Maximum sustainable velocity (U-crit) was measured as an index of aerobic swimming performance and stamina (fatigue time in a fixed-velocity test at 6 body lengths.s(-1)) as an index of anaerobic performance. Individual performance in both of these tests was found to be significantly repeatable. Trout fed on half-satiation ration exhibited significantly lower mean values of SGR and body size and higher levels of aggression-related fin damage, but no significant differences in stamina, relative or absolute U-crit, glycogen content, or plasma cortisol. However, in these fish, there was a significant negative relationship between SGR and relative U-crit, a significant positive relationship between SGR and stamina, and a significant positive relationship between SGR and total daily meal. None of these relationships were seen in fish fed to satiation. Plasma cortisol and tissue glycogen stores were not related to SGR. These results indicate that under the intensified competition of restricted ration, there are trade-offs between growth, feeding, and different types of swimming performance.

AB Manure application should be equally effective in meeting crop nutrient requirements in zero and conventional tillage systems in order to be sustainable in a semi-arid region. A study was conducted from 1993 to 1996 at Scott and Melfort, Saskatchewan, to determine if feedlot cattle manure and inorganic N fertilizer were equally effective as nutrient sources for barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), canola (Brassica rapa L.) and flax (Linum usitatissumum L.) production, and soil N dynamics, in zero and conventional tillage systems. Inorganic fertilizer was compared with a factorial combination of two manure treatments: manure composition (fresh versus stockpiled), and application rate and frequency (annual versus once every four years). Barley and oilseed yields at Scott did not differ between fertilizer and manure treatments, whether manure was applied annually or once every 4 yr. At Melfort, the site with the highest yield potential, grain yields were 24% lower with manure. This yield reduction could be related to soil N availability; net N mineralization was 37 kg ha(-1) lower in plots that received manure rather than inorganic fertilizer. Yield responses to the different types of manure and inorganic fertilizer were similar under zero-till and conventional tillage management. Low levels of N volatilization from the manure, and similar levels of net N mineralization, explained why crop responses to nutrient source did not differ with tillage system. Feedlot cattle manure can be applied as a nutrient source when surface applied in a zero-till system without significant yield reductions compared with soil incorporation in a conventional tillage system.

AB A potential impact of climate change in the south Asian context in general and the Indian subcontinent in particular is an increase in rainfall, in some areas up to 50%. Using an extensive information base available on the dynamics of landscape structure and function of the northeastern hill areas of India, scenarios on landscape changes, as an adaptation to climate change, have been constructed. Climate change would impose a variety of stresses on sustainable livelihood of the inhabitants of the rain-forested areas through stresses on ecosystem function. It is concluded that appropriate management strategies for natural forests and plantation forestry should go hand in hand with a comprehensive rural ecosystem rehabilitation plan.

ID SUPERPOSITION
AB process of bringing ATM traffic control into reality, the ATM Forum has proposed to adopt the Sustainable Cell Rate (SCR) and the Maximum Burst Size (MBS) as traffic descriptors, besides the Peak Cell Rate (PCR). The introduction of the SCR and the MBS aims at obtaining a more efficient multiplexing of source traffic streams than PCR can provide. The choice of SCR, MBS, and PCR, also accounting for the Cell Delay Variation Tolerance of PCR and SCR, CDVTPCR and CDVTSCR respectively, should achieve a (ideally optimal) compromise between the required Quality of Service and the assigned resource cost. The aim of the paper is to provide guidelines for the choice of the SCR and MBS values. First, we evaluate the impact of specific SCR and MBS values on the Usage Parameter Control (UPC) performance in case of measured MPEG and LAN traffic. Then, CAC rules at an access multiplexer are derived by assuming that the input connection cell stream are conforming to their respective traffic contracts in terms of SCR and MBS; the impact of the Values of SCR and MBS on the access multiplexer dimensioning is highlighted. A main result is the definition of conservative resource allocation rules that are easily implementable and yield guaranteed performance. Besides, a detailed analysis is carried out to obtain less conservative and more efficient allocation rules.

AB The haunting picture of a disappearing Aral Sea is just part of an overall environmental crisis in the Aral Sea Basin. where millions of people are dependent on agricultural production around the flows of two main rivers, the Amu Darya and Syr Darya. Forced cotton cultivation in the former Soviet Union, in the context of inefficient agricultural organization and production, caused water mismanagement, salinization, water and soil contamination, erosion and the desiccation of the Aral Sea. In the post-Soviet era of 'transition', the governments of the Central Asian states and international donors have tried to mitigate the impact of the crisis and contain its scope. Resource-based tensions in the region reflect national (and sometimes ethnic) interests vested in the crucial agricultural sectors that provide foreign exchange and food. Although the Central Asian governments are gradually formulating regional water, land and salt management strategies, the room for manoeuvre that exists to implement policies which would immediately improve the environment, such as efficient water management and sustainable land use, is not being sufficiently utilized.

ID CREDIT PROGRAMS
AB This article argues that the costs of lending through solidarity groups are high. This is explained by the nature of groups: groups are not a forum for contractual exchange, but are costly institutions built on social capital. The costs of group formation and interaction outweigh the benefits of high repayment rates associated with group control. Supposedly sustainable group-lenders often depend on large injections of subsidized loans or capital from donors. This is usually ignored in mainstream literature which does not pay sufficient attention to the operational costs of credit extension. The argument is illustrated with a study of the Small Enterprise foundation, South Africa, which shows a contradiction between staff-intensive, personalized lending technology and sufficient cost-recovery.

AB Faced with the imperatives of sustainable development, Earth Science must open to the study of ecosystems and their interactions with a multiscale geophysical environment. The indispensable development of interdisciplinary Earth Science models requires that the crafts and skills of physicists, chemists and biologists merge and cross-fertilize, with often a long way to go for each discipline to win over the others. This paper contains the reflections, queries and suggestions of a marine hydrodynamicist trying to develop coupled physical, chemical and biological marine models and negotiating admittance in the Biogeochemistry Club.

AB Visions of sustainable development often leave unanswered the question: What actions taken by the current generation will ensure that future generations can meet their economic and environmental needs? In this context, we assess the role of technology in steering agriculture along a more sustainable path. From the agricultural sector's perspective, this requires an optimal investment plan for a nation's stock of environmental assets that accounts for an intergenerational fulfillment of sustainability's dual goals: (1) satisfying food and fiber needs at reasonable costs to consumers; and (2) providing environmental service flows. In reviewing agricultural indicators to assess the nation's performance in meeting these goals, we find productivity growth has increased while rates of soil erosion, wetland conversion, and pesticide application have declined. However, individuals continue to demand more environmental services while private markets undersupply environmental services. The capacity of the agricultural sector to meet food and fiber and environmental service demands partially depends on the availability and adoption of new technology. Several market impediments explain the undersupply of sustainable technologies: (1) firms cannot fully appropriate rents from technology development; (2) success may vary with farm structure; (3) the heterogeneity of the resource base influences adoption; and (4) farmers cannot capture the benefits of environmental services. To address these market failures, sustainable agriculture policy should: (1) support research and development in sustainable technologies and provide incentives to encourage adoption; (2) ensure that conservation efforts reflect the efficient and sustainable allocation of environmental assets; and (3) legitimize markets for foods produced under more sustainable practices.

AB The objective of this study was to determine the feasibility of using a designed integrated aquaculture-wetland ecosystem (AWE) for experimental food production and inorganic nitrogen removal from tertiary-treated wastewater. The AWE connected polyculture aquaculture ponds with in-pond aquatic plant systems (water hyacinths, Eichhornia crassipes, and Chinese water spinach, Ipomea aquatica), a solar energy aeration system, and an artificial wetland. Ponds were stocked with hybrid tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus x O. urolepis hornorum), common carp (Cyprinus carpio), mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis), and red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii), and were flushed weekly with new wastewater at 20%. Fish were fed a 32% protein floating ration at 1% fish body weight per day, and wheat bran was added at 1 mg l(-1) when water conductivities exceeded 900 mu umhos cm(-1). Plants were allowed to grow until they reached approximately 50% of the pond surface area, then maintained at this area by manual harvesting. Pond water quality (temperature, conductivity, pH, oxygen) was monitored twice daily, and weekly water samples were taken for analyses of inorganic nitrogen (ammonia and nitrate-N) in the ponds, wetland, and wetland discharge waters (n = 30). Tilapia harvest from three ponds was 1134.5 kg. Fish standing crop biomass increased from 0.16 to 0.21 at stocking to 1.50-2.00 kg m(-3) at harvest. Tilapia grew from an average stocking weight of 21 to 362-404 g at harvest but had poor survival (48-64%) due to heavy bird predation. Total food conversion ratios ranged 0.9-1.2. Approximately 70% of the tilapia were marketed live at $2.20 kg(-1). An estimated standing crop of 1.4 tons wet weight of Ipomea aquatica grew luxuriantly in one 200-m(2) polyculture pond which could be harvested sustainably at 20 kg week(-1). Water hyacinths removed approximately 90% of the ammonia and nitrate-N in wastewater, and the wetland removed an additional 7% (total removal was 97% of wastewater input concentrations). Overflow water exiting the wetland had less than 0.4 mg ammonia-nitrogen l(-1) and no detectable nitrate-nitrogen. The experimental AWE accomplished aquatic food production and almost complete removal of inorganic nitrogen from wastewater, functioning as a 'quartenary' wastewater treatment/food production ecosystem. However, more rigorous experimentation is required to optimize fish- and plant-carrying capacities, nutrient cycles, and testing for bioaccumulation of metals in order for the AWE to be socially and economically relevant. The concept of using tertiary-treated wastewater for aquatic food production may be attractive in the peri-urban areas of many meagcities like Los Angeles, both for fish markets and to stem the growing discharges of wastewaters that are causing coastal pollution.

AB We applied computer modeling as a consensus building tool as part of the development of the Patagonia Coastal Zone Management Plan (PCZMP). The objective was to build a 'scoping model' to assess some of the important ecological and economic interlinkages of the coastal zone of Patagonia. The main purposes were to build consensus, integrate across several parts of the system. and to educate stakeholders about other sectors, not to create a detailed research model. Nevertheless, the model provides some interesting preliminary conclusions. This model indicates that the total net present value (NPV) of the fisheries sector over a period of 40 years may be increased by 13% compared with current income, with a decrease in hake fishing levels by approximate to 50%. The natural capital on which the fishery sector depends would be used in a more sustainable way, both ecologically and economically. The model also simulates possible impacts of oil spills and dumping of tanker ballast water on the penguin population, which can have a significant negative impact on tourist industry incomes. The model implies that the importance of the tourist sector in Patagonia could in the future greatly exceed the value of the fishing industry (by 29%). The results argue for more emphasis on integrating the currently disparate components of coastal zone management. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

ID TROPICAL FOREST; SUSTAINABLE HARVEST
AB Impact of extraction of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) was analyzed irt a thorn scrub forest in Biligiri Rangaswamy Temple (BRT) wildlife sanctuary India. Six species are most commonly extracted from BRT scrub for subsistence and income generation by an aboriginal tribe, the Soliga. Although the forest has been provided protection from indiscriminate felling since 1978 under a wildlife sanctuary cover, changes bl vegetation structure are still occuring as a consequence of anthropogenic pressure in the form of extraction of fuelwood and other NTFPs. The results indicate that large woody species are being replaced by small woody species. The population structure also is becoming increasingly skewed to the smaller size classes due to extraction-bound mortality of the individuals, particularly those >7 cm dbh and above. The data suggest that the scrub community, itself may. be a manifestation of long persisting anthropogenic pressure in the form of extraction of a variety of forest products, and it currently represents a downward transition from a deciduous forest to a shrub thicket.

AB Fuelwood is a predominant source of domestic energy for, rile Soliga, an aboriginal tribe, and non-Soliga people inhabiting rile care and the fringe of the Biligiri Rangaswamy Temple (BRT) wildlife sanctuary in Karnataka, India. Approximately 7000 Soliga and 66 000 non-Soliga people depend on rile 540 km(2) sanctuary fbr fuelwood. The demand for fuelwood is estimated to be 134.7 t d(-1) or 49165 t y(-1) against production of 66 024 t y(-1) for the entire sanctuary. Consumption patterns vary with the season and the altitude. The pressure for fuelwood is far greater on the fringe (85.8%) than in the core (14.2%). The fuelwood supply emanates from an activity cone of 20.1% of the total forest area which produces only 27% of the total demand. Furthermore, only selected species are preferred for fuel use, indicating that only a certain percentage of total productivity is available for extraction. Thus, the demand-supply gap is far greater than it actually appears. A wide gap between demand and supply demonstrates that the BRT forests cannot cater to the fuelwood needs sustainably with lire prevailing patterns of extraction. Probable consequences of fuelwood extraction on biodiversity are discussed, and management options to meet energy requirement and to conserve biodiversity are explored.

TI Overview of future development of fast neutron reactors

DT Article
AB The sustainability of nuclear power generation is an important objective for world energy development. This goal requires maintaining the option of fast neutron breeder reactors. The main challenge is to have breeder technology ready for the day when massive deployment maybe needed. To this purpose, the construction of several prototypes is likely to be insufficient. More extensive operating experience with fast neutron reactors is necessary. This may be achieved by promoting near-term applications of fast neutron reactors, using their remarkable flexibility which makes it possible to burn, store, or breed plutonium. These applications, the CAPRA project and the CAPTURE concept, in addition to accomplishing specific near-term objectives, can yield indispensable experience for reliable future breeder deployment.

AB In this paper we examine the regulation of agricultural practice to reduce the risks of water pollution in England and Wales. We present case-study material concerning water pollution from farm livestock effluents and from agricultural pesticides, and focus on the ways in which farmers and farming practices are being reconfigured under the banner of a move towards a 'more sustainable agriculture'. Pollution policies can be seen as attempts not only to 'stabilise' nature in the rural environment, but also as a process of social ordering as farmers are recast as responsible environmental managers with newly instrumentalised self-governing properties.

AB The Commission on Geological Sciences for Environmental Planning (COGEOENVIRONMENT) of IUGS and UNESCO have initiated a joint project to develop a worldwide data base on earth-science-related environmental problems and to assess which geoscientific information is available locally for prevention, prediction or mitigation of such problems. As a first step, a pilot project on gee-environmental problems and gee-information was launched for central and eastern Europe. In this paper the results of a questionnaire sent to all these partly new countries are presented. Analysis of the results of the questionnaire shows that the most serious and common gee-environmental problems in central and eastern Europe are earthquakes, landslides, soil contamination, groundwater pollution and flooding by rivers. Other gee-environmental problems in this part of Europe and some difficulties experienced during the pilot project are also referred to. Some suggestions for the application of geoscientific knowledge to mitigate such problems are presented at the end of this paper.

AB Identifying goals or targets for landscape and ecosystem management is now a widely recognized need that has received little systematic attention. At a micro-level most planners and managers of both ecosystems and economies continue to pursue traditional goals and targets that miss many desirable characteristics of ecosystem-based management goals. Desirable characteristics of ecosystem and landscape management goals and targets include: addressing complexity, transdisciplinarity, and the dynamic nature of natural systems; reflecting the wide range of interests and goals that exist; recognizing goals and values and limits; involving people and being explainable and implementable in a consistent way to different people and groups; and evolving adaptively as conditions and knowledge change. Substantive and procedural goals can be distinguished; the latter supporting the former. Substantive goals can be grouped according to their relationship to system structure, organization, and process/dynamics, and their disciplinary or subsystemic breadth. These discussions are illustrated by a review of the goals of biodiversity, sustainability, ecological health, and integrity. An example of a hierarchical framework of procedural goals and objectives that supports achievement of substantive goals is also provided. The conclusion is that a parallel, linked system of substantive and procedural goals at different levels of complexity and disciplinarity is needed to facilitate ecosystem-based management.

TI Industry response to the challenge of sustainability: The case of the
   Canadian nonferrous mining sector
SO ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE Canada; environmental management; minerals industry; nonferrous metals;
   sustainable development; Whitehorse Mining initiative
AB The paper investigates how the Canadian nonferrous sector is tackling the challenge of sustainable development. Although there is no consensus as to what sustainable development means in practice for management in the sector, at least three dimensions must be taken into account: (1) metals are recyclable, the availability of this resource is not a concern for the foreseeable future; (2) the need to minimize environmental impacts of metals exploration, extraction, transformation, consumption, and recycling; and (3) production activities should not be socially or culturally disruptive.
   The nonferrous mining industry faces several environmental problems. Some of the most significant are acid mine drainage, sulfur emissions, recycling, and metals toxicity. The industry has developed a number of responses to address these specific concerns as well as other more general challenges. Six strategies are described and analyzed: (1) research and development, (2) an effort of consensus building among stakeholders known as the Whitehorse Mining Initiative, (3) international networking, (4) active involvement in the development of environmental management standards, (5) management reorganization and (6) voluntary agreements. The importance of external factors in the shaping of corporate environmental management practices is discussed, in particular the role of government.
   Progress has been achieved in three areas: (1) managerial practices and organization, (2) reducing the impacts of ongoing operations and (3) minimizing future liabilities, but two significant fields of conflict remain, namely mining in wilderness areas and projects on aboriginal lands.

TI Agency-community partnership in Landcare: Lessons for state-sponsored
   citizen resource management
SO ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT

DT Article
DE Landcare; Australia; community participation; rural development; citizen
   resource management; sustainable agriculture
ID PUBLIC-PARTICIPATION; AUSTRALIA
AB With over 2500 Australian Landcare groups, 65,000 volunteer members, and considerable evidence of program impact, Landcare is an important example of state-sponsored rural development in a developed nation. The agency-community partnership is a fundamental element of Landcare and getting the partnership right is vital to long-term program success. After reviewing the emergence of Landcare in the state of Victoria, the author reports research from a 1995 survey of Victorian Landcare groups. Survey information highlighted the extent of agency-group contact, the important roles agency staff played in many Landcare groups, and the positive impact of agency contact and government funding upon group activity. Large majorities of groups reported they were satisfied with their relationship with agency staff. However, a majority of groups reported money or materials provided to manage land and water degradation was inadequate. Recently proposed changes to the Landcare program will provide government funding of work on private property and may address this concern. A majority of groups also reported support for leadership and management training was inadequate and respondents emphasized the need to revise program guidelines that limit funding for group coordinators. This information highlighted the importance of articulating a practical model of community participation in Australia and adopting a systematic approach to providing agency support for Landcare groups. Reflecting upon the Landcare experience, the author suggests some of the key elements of a practical model of state-sponsored citizen resource management contributing to rural development.

TI Does Canada need a national wildland fire strategy?
SO FORESTRY CHRONICLE
LA English
DT Article
AB Although wildland fire is important to sustainable forestry in Canada, there is evidence that this is not well recognized outside the fire community. Fire significantly impacts three components of sustainability - people, wood supply, and ecosystems. Mitigating or enhancing any of the three diminishes the other two. Although fire policies attempt to balance the three processes, this is difficult to achieve in practice. Projected escalation of Canadian fire regimes, coupled with the likelihood of decreasing fire budgets, heighten the importance of a national discussion on this issue. A three-stage approach to resolve the problem is proposed - revising the fire elements of the National Forest Strategy, developing a National Fire Strategy, and developing criteria and indicators for fire. The paper concludes with recommended steps to implement the process.

SO FORESTRY CHRONICLE

DT Article
AB The author describes what he sees as the five biggest challenges facing stakeholders of the Canadian forest sector at the beginning of the XXI century. The first is building strong political support for forest development through information and education at a time when public opinion is opposing it; the second is prioritizing the development of private forests by reversing the northerly direction historically followed by forest activities in Canada; the third is defining sustainable forest development and implementing it on a stable land base, following sound forest practices codes and certification standards, with full public involvement; the fourth is convincing forest land owners to invest more attention, time, effort and even money in growing more wood and offering more services on their properties in order to fulfill an increasing demand; and the last challenge is convincing all levels of government to each support their share of the forest activities to ensure a sustained flow of benefits to forest land owners, industrial shareholders, and society as a whole.

AB Insects and microorganisms perform a variety of functions in forest ecosystems. A minority of these organisms have been designated as pests. A fair understanding of the pests of mature boreal forests in west-central Canada has been developed. In many cases this has permitted the development of integrated pest management systems methodologies culminating, where appropriate, in the development of decision support systems. Research and development is currently underway to develop and improve such systems for managing pests of young stands. A general principle guiding the management of young stands suggests that emulating natural stand development will minimize losses due to pests. However, biological control techniques are being developed to enhance productivity where it is not feasible for management to emulate natural stand development. The philosophy employed in developing these methods is to rely on the conservation of the biota as they provide a reservoir from which to select organisms which may be useful in development of pest management procedures. Furthermore, the concern of the Canadian public regarding environmental degradation and the extremely low costs of successful biological control strategies, often involving emulating natural stand development to conserve beneficial organisms and obtain desirable stand densities and tree form, favour the development of these strategies to guarantee the sustainability of Canadian forests.

AB The aim of the present paper was to present a hypothesis for description of sustainable development as a process towards a future sustainable state of the system 'man-environment'. A theoretical approach was used to present the behavior of the system as based on the rules of thermodynamics for open heterogeneous systems. The tendency of human impact on the development of the system as well as changes in the level of sustainability were also speculated. The role for health promotion, quality of life, externalities and environmental quality in sustainable development were discussed and examples given. Finally, critical remarks as well as suggestions for multidisciplinary approach toward complexity of development problems and prerequisites of sustainable future were also presented.

SO GEODERMA

DE organic farming; environmental quality; simulation modelling
AB A land quality indicator, defined as a ratio between actual and potential production of wheat under Dutch conditions with acceptable leaching of nitrates and risks, is proposed. Production was simulated for 30 years, expressing temporal weather variability, using a wide range of nitrogen fertilization scenarios and including nitrate leaching to the groundwater. Yields were calculated considering probabilities ('implied risks') that yield potentials were not reached and that nitrate leaching exceeded environmental threshold values. Calculations were made for a prime agricultural soil in the Netherlands (loamy, mixed, mesic Typic Fluvaquent) comparing fields having had long-term organic- and conventional management. Quality indicators were consistently higher for the land with organic management. The proposed calculations are reflected in a graph with production and associated nitrate leaching rates and their probabilities of exceedance. The graph provides a framework. A single land quality indicator can be derived only after decisions on risk acceptability have been made. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Since the Earth first came into existence environmental change has involved the redistribution of elements and compounds via biogeochemical cycles. Such cycles link the lithosphere, biosphere and atmosphere within reciprocal relationships. These relationships have been profoundly altered by human activity but remain reciprocal. Examples are given to illustrate the magnitude of anthropogenic perturbations to the global biogeochemical cycles of carbon, nitrogen and sulphur. The major issues concern fossil fuel consumption which influences all three cycles, and agriculture which affects the carbon and nitrogen cycles in particular. Anthropogenic perturbations of these cycles has given rise to some of the most important environmental issues of the 1990s, notably global climatic change, acidification and cultural eutrophication. Policies and protocols to mitigate these problems indirectly represent efforts to manage biogeochemical cycles. In view of a likely 46 per cent increase in human population In the next three decades, biogeochemical perturbations will undoubtedly intensify, the impact of which will require increasingly close management. This will need to lake into account the interactions between the cycles.

DE Kenya rangelands; Maasai; group ranches; sub-division; land degradation
AB The Kenyan Government introduced group ranches in Kajiado District in the 1960s. They were aimed at addressing the problem of overgrazing and land degradation: said to bk occurring in the pastoral arid and semi-arid areas. by converting communal to group tenure. This was expected to encourage the Maasai nomadic pastoralists to confine their livestock within ranch boundaries and reduce their livestock numbers. Although group ranches in Kajiado failed to meet these expectations, they secured the Maasai's traditional land against alienation by non-Maasai. Thereafter, the Maasai continued using their land along traditional lines, which is increasingly being recognized as the most efficient and sustainable use. Group ranch sub-division into individual plots in Kajiado began in the 1980s with government support. Further fragmentation of plots and sale, in many cases to non-Maasai: followed sub-division. Average plot sizes have decreased, while the number of fenced properties and the levels of cultivation have increased. Due to sub-division: the Maasai are gradually losing their best land and are being pushed into the drier areas. Sub-division will threaten continued extensive nomadic livestock production by decreasing mobility and the carrying capacity of group ranch land, increase the potential for land degradation and crop failures, and interfere with traditional wildlife migration patterns.

AB The forthcoming Kyoto Protocol will make an interesting comparison with the Montreal Protocol in some ten years time. Doubtless many Ph. D. theses will be produced on the basis of that tantalizing prospect. The Montreal Protocol was always designed to be self-implementing and it is probably unwise to draw too many lessons for the future of global environmental diplomacy. The stock of ozone-depleting chemicals was technically discoverable and calculable, and substitutes were for the most part already present or on offer. Global corporations could see a lucrative future in creating less depleting agents, and in designing the technology to guarantee their consumption. At least the Protocol has created a modest success in international regime design as Robert Falkner shows in the article that follows. By making side-payments through an international ozone fund to encourage reluctant parties to participate, the industrialized country Parties have successfully expanded the membership of the regime and addressed the thorny questions of justice and historical responsibility. But continued ozone depletion will overreach the coming century, black markets will continue to flourish and the Northern economies will generate additional profits from less than perfect solution. is this what sustainable development is supposed to be about?

TI Low cost home ownership initiatives in the UK
SO HOUSING STUDIES

DT Article
AB In common with many other countries, the UK has treated owner occupation favourably in comparison with other tenures in terms of tax and subsidy. However, the UK is distinctive in having encouraged the large-scale transfer of dwellings from the public rented sector to horne ownership and in having developed a variety gf low cost home ownership (LCHO) mechanisms to assist people at the margins into owner occupation. This paper evaluates these LCHO initiatives, considering value for money, sustainability and potential demand. Looking to the future, we see government policy and the level of demand as the most important determinants of the role of LCHO and discuss influences on demand and pointers to government policy.

AB Is it possible to satisfy the growing demand for food taking care of the environment and of the resources? To answer this question an analysis of the future demand of food and of the potential capacity of agricultural production is made for different regions.
   To think in a well fed population through a sustainable use of resources is not utopic. Humand population will stabilize in the incoming century and the planet has a gr eat potential for food production, many times greater than the future stabilized demand. Moreover, the amazing technological development is providing tools unthinkable a few years ago.
   To reach the goal, it is necessary to make a strong investment in agricultural research and extension, in education and in rural development. Thus, the solution from the tecnical point of view is highly possible.
   Aspects related to moral decission of men leave some doubts about the future of mankind. There is no doubt that if starvation, serious nutritional problems and severe degradation are taking place in parts of the world and the perspectives for certain areas of the world are not encouraging, is not because Malthus was right, bill because egoism and lack of solidarity prevail. The key question is not whether we can to feed mankind, it is whether we want to do it.

AB The history of defence strategy in Brazil has been largely peace-orientated and the armed forces, which have developed independently, have been relatively small. However, recent stability in the economy, consolidation of democratic processes, and cooperation with its neighbours in the region have provided Brazil with the opportunity for new defence thinking which culminated in the 1996 announcement of a National Defence Policy (NDP). In this article the author assesses Brazil's place in the South American strategic theatre and the objectives and main purposes of the NDP. He examines the preventative, cooperative and non-military components of the Policy, which seeks to ensure a balance between state security and social well-being.

TI From civil war to 'civil society': has the end of the Cold War brought
   peace to Central America?
SO INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
LA English
DT Article
ID EL-SALVADOR; AGRARIAN
AB Revisiting one arena of the Cold War-Central America-which dominated international headlines in the 1980s, this article explores its legacy on the region. It asks whether the ending of the Cold War and the peace accords which concluded the internal wars of Nicaragua, El Salvador and Guatemala in 1990, 1992 and 1996, respectively, have brought sustainable peace, development and democracy. In particular, it explores the changing agenda of international financial and development agencies which have supported the postwar reconstruction of the region. The experiences of Nicaragua and El Salvador have shown that failure to coordinate the efforts at economic adjustment with those of peace-building compromised the possibilities of development and democratization, particularly for the poorest sectors of the population. Conservative elites who emerged intact h-om the war were able to consolidate their economic power, and resist and Limit political reform, while handing responsibility for the poor and the former war zones to international agencies. The latter have shifted their agenda in the Guatemalan peace process, incorporating a strategy of 'civil society strengthening' in order to build capacity within society to create more accountable and democratic states,
   The conclusion of the article explores the ambiguities of this strategy. On the positive side it legitimizes and protects the newly won but fragile freedoms of speech and association in the region; on the negative side, it risks turning a historical social and political dynamic into externally funded 'projects' with limited sustainability, whose outcome many international agencies tend to assume they can shape to their own expectations.

AB The aerobic performance of a heterogeneous group of 89 ambulatory medically stable patients on chronic hemodialysis was studied to define individual levels of the most acceptable metabolic workload. The patients performed a step test protocol (3 steps) with a cycle ergometer. Each step (25 Watt) lasted 6 min. Heart rate (HR), oxygen consumption (VO2), ventilation (VE), respiratory exchange ratio (RER), blood pressure (BP) and subjective ratings of dyspnea (CRd) and fatigue (CRf) levels were monitored throughout the test The test was continued to exhaustion or to values of systolic arterial blood pressure (SABP) >240 mmHg, heart rate (HR) greater than or equal to 85% max, or ST changes in EGG. In eleven patients (12.5% of the whole group) the test was interrupted within the first two minutes of exercise. In the remaining 78 patients, the maximum workload sustained for at least 3 min (MSW) was 25 Watts for 43 (48.5%), 50 Watts for 27 (30%), and 75 Watts for 8 (9%) patients. Performance was affected in a statistically significant manner by the subjects' anagraphic age, but not by their dialytic age, hemoglobin (Hb) level or weight. Individual levels of tolerable workload were estimated for 60% of the group from the stability of physiological variables during 3 min, and from subjective ratings at a "moderate" level. This level corresponded to an average of 3.5+/-0.9 METs, at 60% of the HRmax, with a mean BP of 167+/-21/98+/-14 mmHg. This could become a safe starting point for a program of physical retraining.

AB In January 1997, the German Research Association (DFG) established a special research programme for an integrated analysis of metallic resource flows. The programme is a joint interdisciplinary effort of the Technical University of Aachen and of the Research Centre Julich. Apart from many other activities, a series of conferences is organised within this programme. In October 1997, a first conference was held on "The Economics of Resource Flows: The Case of Aluminium". In December 1997, a second conference took place on "Life Cycle Assessment of Aluminium: Methods and Applications". In April 1998 the third workshop was held entitled "Methodological Aspects of a Resource-oriented Analysis of Material Flows". The next conference is planned for December 1998 on "Environmental related Aspects of Aluminium Production". Finally, a conference on " Methods for an Integrated Evaluation of Material Flows" is under consideration for 1999.

AB This paper examines urban poverty in Africa in the context of structural adjustment. The paper begins by examining briefly some of the external and internal factors responsible for Africa's poverty and locks at structural adjustment as an IMF and World Bank prescription intended to bring African economies back into the path of sustainable growth. The paper also considers the social impact of structural adjustment and how this has exacerbated the problem of urban poverty. Lastly, the paper looks at the implications for social work practice.

AB Poor and vulnerable populations are disproportionately concentrated in the most ecologically degraded environments of the world. In developing countries degraded environments threaten the survival of rural households. Developing countries have been launching, in partnership with rural people, a wide variety of development programs to improve these degraded and depleted environments. The paper examines women's participation in community forestry programs and factors that contribute to their participation in reforestation programs. The paper, drawing from several case studies conducted in Nepal, discusses factors hindering the involvement of rural poor in these programs: barriers rooted in the fear of exploitation and inaccessibility of resources. It then outlines how social workers can advocate for the participation of the poor to promote sustainable development.

AB This multinational study examined the relationship between values, awareness of the consequences for environmental damage, ascribed responsibility, and proenvironmental behaviors. Survey data were collected from college students in Mexico (n = 187), Nicaragua (n = 78), Peru (n = 160), Spain (n = 187), and the United States (n = 345), Measures included items from Schwartz's values instrument, self-reported proenvironmental behaviors, ascribed responsibility, the New Environmental Paradigm, and demo graphics. Regression analyses revealed a positive relationship between items within self-transcendence (especially the environment-oriented items) and proenvironmental behavior in Mexico, Nicaragua, Spain, and the United States. Additional analyses provided partial support for the extension of Schwartz's model of norm-activation to proenvironmental behavior.

AB Political pressure is exerted in many countries to feces agricultural and environmental research on market-driven applications, rather than on basic research. This can become a real problem because our expertise needs to be continuously fed with new ideas originating from basic research. Rather than rigidly oppose the trend, we advocate research procedures where applied and basic research logically fit together in so-called research chains. More time should be spent in any project on defining the most efficient research chain in close interaction with stakeholders, comparing relatively simple (and inexpensive) procedures using expert knowledge with more complicated land expensive) ones that mag include basic research using sophisticated methodology. Research chains are illustrated for cage studies on soil acidification and precision agriculture, while chains are described for organic farming, Basic research is defined differently and more effectively when it is part of a research chain, as compared with independent formulation. Information technology plays an increasingly important role in the evolving interactive research paradigm where the former linear research model is replaced by the hourglass model, which requires an interdisciplinary research approach and defines basic research on issues where existing knowledge is clearly inadequate. Application of simulation modeling and geostatistics allows expression in terms of risks that threshold values of sustainability indicators are exceeded. Regulators have the prime responsibility to decide which risks are acceptable, Researchers offer options rather than judgements. In addition to realizing research chains including basic research, independent funding for basic research in promising future areas of work is necessary as well.

AB The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) and some state agencies regulate trace element additions to soil from land application of biosolids, We generally consider trace elements added in biosolids (sewage sludge) to accumulate in the soil surface without significant transport below the plow layer, We used 11 yr of field-study information from biosolids addition to dryland hard red winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L,'Vona' or 'TAM107') to determine the distribution of NH4HCO3 diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (AB-DTPA)-extractable Cd, Cr, Cu, Mo, Ni, Ph, and Zn in 0 to 20 (plow layer), 20 to 60, 60 to 100, and 100 to 150 cm depth increments, This study is unique since it involves multiple biosolids application in a dryland summer fellow agroecosystem, We applied five or six applications of biosolids from the cities of Littleton and Englewood, CO, to Weld loam (a fine, montmorillonitic, mesic Aridic Paleustoll) or Platner loam (a fine, montmorillonitic, mesic Aridic Paleustoll) at four locations, This paper focuses on the 0 (control), the 56 or 67 kg of N ha(-1) fertilizer rates, and the 6.7 and 26.8 dry Mg of biosolids ha(-1) rates that we added every crop year. We observed significant (P < 0.10) accumulations of the trace elements in the plow layer of the biosolids-amended soils. Only Zn showed consistent increases in extractable levels below the plow layer at all four sites, The biosolids Zn concentration (average of similar to 1300 mg kg(-1)) was larger than any other trace element resulting in larger loading of this element,

TI Heavy metal balances of an Italian soil as affected by sewage sludge and
   Bordeaux mixture applications
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY
LA English
DT Article
ID ACCUMULATION
AB Applications of sewage sludge and Bordeaux mixture (Bm) (a mixture of copper sulfate and lime) add heavy metals to the soil. At an experimental farm in the Cremona district (Italy), we measured current heavy metal contents in soil and their removal via harvested products. We also measured heavy metal adsorption by soil from this farm. With these data, projections were made of the Long-term development of heavy metal (Cd, Cu, and Zn) contents in soil, crop removal, and leaching at different application rates of sewage sludge and Fm, These projections were compared with existing quality standards of the European Union (EU) and Italy with regard to soil and groundwater, The calculations reveal that the permitted annual application rates of sewage sludge and Bm are likely to result in exceedance of groundwater and soil standards. Sew age sludge applications, complying with the Italian (I) legal limits, may pose problems for Cd, Cu, and Zn within 30, 70, and 100 yr, respectively, Furthermore, severe Cu pollution of integrated (mildew controlled by Fm and organopesticides) and especially organic (Bm only) vineyards is unavoidable with the currently allowed application rates of Bm. The results suggest that the current I soil protection policy as well as the EU policy are not conducive of a sustainable heavy metal management in agroecosystems.

Although the stand initially conformed well to the target structure, deficits of poletimber and surpluses of sawtimber ave since developed. Viewing stand structure in terms of area occupied by 10-year age classes, in addition to the diameter distribution, reveals important structural and species imbalances and suggests future management directions.

AB Data spanning 60 years on uneven-aged lolblolly-shortleaf pine stands in Arkansas show that two regulation methods have been successful in regulating stand development. Key attributes of these methods are that regulation is more important than balance, basal area drives stand development, and regeneration is the first indicator of sustainability. Marking uneven-aged stands best kept simple: mark to cut the poorest trees and leave the best, regardless of target structure or method of regeneration. To be successful in the long term, new methods of regulating uneven-aged and multiaged stands should share these attributes.

TI Systems for sustainable organizations: Emergent strategies, interactive
   controls and semi-formal information
SO JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
ID HIGH-VELOCITY ENVIRONMENTS; COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE; TECHNOLOGY; WORK
AB New-form organizations are likely to organize more explicitly around processes than traditional-form organizations that emphasize functional hierarchy. Developing process-based strategic responses quickly using diffuse sets of resources is likely to play an increasingly important role in sustaining new organizational forms. Three ideas introduce alternative perspectives on strategy formulation, management control and information systems design that may be useful in understanding organizational performance in this area. They focus on: (1) emergent strategies, (2) interactive management controls, and (3) semi-formal systems. In combination these three perspectives describe relationships between strategy, organizational design and systems support that suggest mechanisms for improving the sustainability of new organizational forms.
   To some degree distributed organizational structures such as networked organizations and quasi-organizational forms such as alliances, partnerships and joint ventures represent attempts to solve a paradox of competitive agility. This paradox suggests that in the context of rapidly changing, increasingly global markets, organizations need to be flexible (so they can respond quickly to competitive threats) yet remain stable (so they can learn and grow based on their strengths). If this is the case, what systems and tools are available that encourage a productive balance between flexibility and stability?
   This paper uses the experience of regional management teams at a large consumer goods company to suggest how interactive controls and semi-formal information systems combine to increase the agility of a distributed organization that can employ emergent strategies. Evidence illustrates some of the mechanisms by which (a) faster response times deliver organizational flexibility while (b) semiformal analytics add the stability of knowledge and guidance shared across organizational sites. Examples discuss the use of information within management teams, discussion behaviour within management meetings, and organizational performance in response to crisis events. In this context the paper analyses the characteristics of new-form systems that could be used to sustain new-form organizations.
   While the development of process-oriented semi-formal systems is just beginning, the potential for linking such technology with newly developed approaches to management control appears to have important implications for the practice and performance of management in new-form organizations. In particular, interactive controls and semi-formal information appear to offer leverage as mechanisms for organizational adjustment during times when organizations must exploit emergent strategies.

TI The augmented service offering: A conceptualization and study of its
   impact on new service success
SO JOURNAL OF PRODUCT INNOVATION MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID FINANCIAL SERVICES; PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT; CONSUMER PERCEPTIONS; FAILURE;
   QUALITY; DETERMINANTS; MODEL
AB Unlike companies that produce tangible goods, service firms typically cannot rely on product advantage as a means for ensuring the success of a new service. Developing a competitive response to a tangible product may require significant investments of time and effort. In many cases, however, competitors can easily duplicate the core.elements of a firm's new service. This fundamental difference between new products and new services means that managers who hope to find the keys to new-service success must look to factors other than sustainable product advantage.
   Chris Storey and Christopher Easingwood suggest that managers must understand the totality of the service offering from the customer's perspective. They explain that the purchase of a service is influenced not. only by the service itself; but also by such factors as the service firm's reputation and the quality of the customer's interaction with the firm's systems and staff-in other words, by the augmented service offering (ASO). Using the results of a study they conducted in the consumer financial services industry in the U.K., they identify the components of the ASO, and they examine the relative contributions of these components to the success of new services.
   In their model, the ASO comprises three elements: the service product, service augmentation, and marketing support. The core of the ASO-the service product-includes such dimensions as product quality, product distinctiveness, and perceived risk. The study's results suggest that improvements in the service product open up new opportunities for the firm, but have only modest effects on sales and profitability.
   Rounding out the ASO model are service augmentation and marketing support. Service augmentation encompasses such dimensions as distribution strength, staff-customer interactions, and reputation. The customer recognizes and responds to these elements of the ASO, but they are not part of the product core. Marketing support involves those marketing and management actions that affect the quality of the product and its augmentation, even though customers typically are not aware of them. These elements include knowledge of the marketplace, training of contact staff and internal marketing. Enhanced service augmentation has significant effects on profitability and sales for the firms in this study, but it does not offer enhanced opportunities. The marketing support elements contribute significantly to all aspects of performance for the firms in this study. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Inc.

AB Diversification of the traditional dryland cropping system in the central Great Plains (winter wheat [Triticum aestivum L.]-fallow) could lead to a more sustainable production system, Selection of suitable crops to rotate with winter wheat requires knowledge of productivity under a widely varying precipitation regime. The objectives of this study were to determine water use/yield relationships and likely average production levels for spring canola (Brassica napus L.), crambe (Crambe abyssinicia Hochst), and sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.), and to determine differences in oil concentration and soil water extraction patterns among these three crops. Canola, crambe, and sunflower were grown under a Line-source, gradient irrigation (GI) system to determine seed yield and oil concentration under a range of water use. Sunflower was also grown in several dryland rotations following a variety of crops, which resulted in a range of starting soil water conditions. Soil mater extraction was monitored with a neutron probe and time-domain reflectometry, All three crops exhibited linear responses of yield to water use. Sunflower was less responsive than canola and crambe, which had nearly identical water use/yield functions. Oil concentrations showed a trend for increasing oil content with increasing water use. Sunflower extracted water from lower soil depths than canola and crambe, which were similar in soil water extraction. Median yield levels predicted from long-term precipitation records at Akron, CO, were 1130, 1180, and 1520 lb/acre for canola, crambe, and sunflower, respectively. All three crops are agronomically feasible oilseed crops for dryland rotations,vith winter wheat in the central Great Plains.

TI Sustainable development and the ADCE Code of Ethics
SO JOURNAL OF PROFESSIONAL ISSUES IN ENGINEERING EDUCATION AND PRACTICE
LA English
DT Article
AB Prior to its 1997 revision, the ASCE Code of Ethics only peripherally addressed the interaction of the engineer with the environment. Engineers seeking guidance on their professional responsibility found that only on issues where their actions harmed other human beings was the Code useful. In other words, the Code of Ethics did not address environmentally damaging actions that were not clearly detrimental to the "health, safety, or welfare of the public." Recognition by the ASCE leadership that civil engineers face daily issues concerning environmental quality prompted the Society to modify its Code of Ethics to include a statement on "sustainable development.'' Sustainable development is the concept that we can continue to develop and change the environment, but that we should do so in a way that will not compromise the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. In this paper, we first examine the origin of the need to include the sustainable development clause in the Code of Ethics, and then, to examine the usefulness of this modification to the Code, concluding that its addition does not seem to prevent blatant environmental destruction. Most importantly, the sustainable development option does not offer assistance to engineers seeking guidance on their actions toward the environment. Finally, we offer one code that, although radical in its approach, clearly states the responsibility of engineers toward the environment, and recommend that the ASCE consider modifying its own Code of Ethics to reflect some of the principles in the alternative code.

AB The engineering profession must embrace the ethic of sustainability in engineering education, in continuing professional development, and in practice. The current scene from a United Kingdom perspective is presented, including developments elsewhere. The results of surveys into the environmental content in undergraduate curricula are given. Changing requirements of the Engineering Council and the Joint Board of Moderators are presented. Initiatives from the Royal Academy of Engineering are highlighted as are those of young engineers of the Commonwealth. An overview is presented of the linkages between business and the environment. The work of the World Federation of Engineering Organisations in the area of environmental education is highlighted, as is the work of the Institution of Civil Engineers and Institution of Chemical Engineers in learned society and continuing professional development matters. The engineering profession stands at a fork in the road; will it continue in the existing paradigm or will it change direction along the path marked "the liberated and civilized engineer''? People matter, but their attitudes to the natural world and to each other matter most of all.

AB Shortgrass rangeland, dominated by blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis [H.B.K.] Lag. ex Steud), was grazed at 3 intensities, equivalent to mean stocking rates of 16.7, 23.0, and 36.5 heifer-days ha(-1), from 1939 through 1994, Few changes in plant communities had been documented by the early 1970's, In 1992-1994, frequency of occurrence, basal and foliar cover, and biomass at peak standing crop (PSC) were determined on the remaining pasture at each grazing intensity, and on 3 ungrazed exclosures, Blue grama and buffalograss (Buchloe; dactyloides [Nutt,] Engelm,) increased, and western wheatgrass (Pascopyrum smithii [Rydb,] A. Love) and needle-and-thread (Stipa comata Trin, & Rupr.) decreased, as grazing intensity increased. Redthree-awn (Aristida longisieta Steud.) was most plentiful under light grazing. Basal cover and biomass of forbs were lower under grazing than in exclosures, but differences in biomass were not significant. Shrubs and half-shrubs decreased as grazing intensity increased. Frequency and cover of plains pricklypear (Opuntia polyacantha Haw,) were higher in the exclosures and under light grazing than under moderate or heavy grazing; biomass was 4 to 6 times as high in the exclosures as under any grazing intensity. Heifer gains declined linearly with increasing grazing pressure index. Optimum (most profitable) stocking rate was about 20% higher than that under the moderate grazing intensity, under which biomass production was maintained and shrub and pricklypear remained at low levels. Returns to land, labor, and management were only slightly higher under the optimum stocking rate than under the moderate grazing intensity. The moderate grazing intensity appears to be both profitable and sustainable.

AB Long-term investigations into wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) reproduction are needed to allow for annual fluctuations, illuminate trends not evident From short-term data, and provide data for effective sustainable management of the wild turkey resource. We used 13 years (1984-96) of continuous data to estimate reproductive parameters of a wild turkey population in central Mississippi. Mean rates of reproductive parameters were 72.3% for first-nest initiation rates, 27.9% for first-nest success, 34.8% for renest initiation, and 24.6% for renest success. Median date of incubation ranged from 12 April to 1 May. Juvenile hens did not contribute to reproduction. Hen success declined significantly over time and reflected a decreasing population. Most (51.1%) nest failures were attributed to predation. Poult survival until late July-August was 25.5%. Winter weather did not influence reproductive parameters, and hen experience did not increase nest success. Mean hen success for this population was the lowest reported fbr ally eastern wild turkey (M. g. silvestris) population. Low hen success via lack of productivity from renest attempts, lack of juvenile hell reproduction, and low nest success may have contributed to the population decline. A simplistic population model indicated that, given current reproduction and hen survival, maintaining wild turkeys as a closed population on our area is doubtful.

DT Article
DE nutrient harvesting; teras systems; soil fertility; Sudan (eastern);
   soil and water conservation
AB The indigenous teras water harvesting system offers greater production security, but its major benefit is that it raises the nutrient-limited yield from some 150-250 kg ha(-1) to some 650 kg ha(-1) through its nutrient harvesting effects. Soil fertility was found to be two to four times higher inside the teras field. Calculated nutrient-limited yields are considerably higher than real yields, which points at other yield-limiting factors such as labour and water availability. The example of the teras system shows that nutrient harvesting may in some cases be a viable alternative to application of mineral fertilizers. This implies that indigenous technologies can be sustainable and should be thoroughly examined before they are complemented by external inputs. (C) 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB The emergence of land markets in developing countries sometimes concentrates property rights in individual 'owners,' restricting the rights held by other claimants under customary tenure systems. By neglecting livelihood and environmental externalities, this may undermine the objectives of sustainable development This paper draws lessons from the United States' experience using property rights as policy tools to accommodate multiple interests in resource use and conservation without incurring the political costs of regulation or the full financial costs of land acquisition. The benefits of such tools must be weighed against potentially significant costs, including those of monitoring and enforcing complex property arrangements over time.

TI Agenda 21 and sea-based pollution: opportunity or apathy?
SO MARINE POLICY
LA English
DT Article
AB The paper re-examines the views expressed by Nollkaemper in a paper published in Marine Policy in November 1993 concerning Agenda 21 and the prevention of sea-based marine pollution, at the same time as providing an up-to-date account of what has subsequently transpired under the auspicies of the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) to implement the outcome of the Rio Earth Summit held in June 1992. The paper contrasts Nollkaemper's predictions as to issues that might be expected to receive attention in the context of Agenda 21 with actual developments on related issues in IMO over the past five years. Emerging issues covered by the paper Include incorporation by IMO of the precautionary approach and progress made in implementing IMO's strategy for extra budgetary activities relating to environmentally sustainable development, covering such issues as the provision of waste reception facilities in ports and capacity-building for coastal states bordering a shalt used for international navigation. The aim of the latter is to develop self-sustaining financial mechanisms which would effectively transfer the cost to the user of the facility, thus eliminating the difficulties that many developing countries have in meeting international safety and environmental standards. Until 1995 the author was cc-ordinator of IMO's follow-up to the Earth Summit as a full-time staff member of the Organisation's Marine Environment Division. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

DT Article
AB The Government of Canada is in the process of developing an oceans strategy and management regime for sustainable ocean development. This paper examines the implications of this approach. It develops a basic economic and management framework for dealing with sustainable oceans development, examines some of the issues associated with ocean industries in Canada, and points out some of the inadequacies of Canada's present management of ocean industries (a method that utilizes an individual-industry focus). The paper supports the thesis that a sustainable ocean management regime could be more efficient and effective in solving some of the current and future difficulties faced by Canada's ocean industries.

TI Performance indicators for management of marine recreational fisheries
SO MARINE POLICY
LA English
DT Article
AB Existing measures for management of marine recreational fisheries fail to provide demonstrable improvements and arguably impede satisfaction of many wants of recreational fishers. We suggest that these circumstances are due to failure to understand the nature of the fishery and apply economic principles to its management, resulting in much of the fishery being effectively unpriced. Problems also result from failure to appreciate the implications of sustainability, including an appropriate time scale. We examine a possible approach to these aspects of fisheries management involving establishment of property rights. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Determinants of soil microbial communities: Effects of agricultural
   management, season, and soil type on phospholipid fatty acid profiles
SO MICROBIAL ECOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID EXTRACTION METHOD; MARINE-SEDIMENTS; BIOMASS; POPULATIONS; DIVERSITY
AB Phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) profiles were measured in soils from organic, low-input, and conventional farming systems that are part of the long term Sustainable Agriculture Farming Systems (SAFS) Project. The farming systems differ in whether their source of fertilizer is mineral or organic, and in whether a winter cover crop is grown. Sustained increases in microbial biomass resulting from high organic matter inputs have been observed in the organic and low-input systems. PLFA profiles were compared to ascertain whether previously observed changes in biomass were accompanied by a change in the composition of the microbial community. In addition, the relative importance of environmental variables on PLFA profiles was determined. Redundancy analysis ordination showed that PLFA profiles from organic and conventional systems were significantly different from April to July. On ordination plots, PLFA profiles from the low-input system fell between organic and conventional systems on most sample dales. A group of fatty acids (i14:0, a15:0, 16:1 omega 7c, 16:1 omega 5c, 14:0, and 18:2 omega 6c) was enriched in the organic plots throughout the sampling period, and another group (10Me16:0, 20H 16:1 and 10Me17:0) was consistently lower in relative abundance in the organic system. In addition, another group (15:0, a17:0, i16:0, 17:0, and 10Me18:0) was enriched over the short term in the organic plots after compost incorporation. The relative importance of various environmental variables in governing the composition of microbial communities could be ranked in the order: soil type > time > specific farming operation (e.g., cover crop incorporation or sidedressing with mineral fertilizer) > management system > spatial variation in the field. Measures of the microbial community and soil properties (including microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen, substrate induced respiration, basal respiration, potentially mineralizable nitrogen, soil nitrate and ammonium, and soil moisture) were seldom associated with the variation in the PLFA profiles.

AB The Great Barrier Reef off the queensland coast of Australia is managed with a goal of maintaining and enhancing those qualities which made it the world's first (1981) and largest (348, 700 km(2)) marine World Heritage Area while keeping it accessible for multiple uses, notably tourism, fishing and shipping. Basic and strategic research, ranging from the Great Barrier Reef Expedition of 1928 to the present, have provided a substantial knowledge base on the nature and function of the Reef, Most recently, two initiatives have combined to give scientists opportunities to become more responsive to the needs of users and managers: the development of the Twenty-five Year Strategic Plan for the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area, and the establishment of the Go-operative Research Centre for the Ecologically Sustainable Development of the Great Barrier Reef. The completed Plan includes a vision, principles, objectives and strategies based on the cumulative insights coming from all parties. Three issues of widespread concern have become major foci of research - the sustainable limits to commercial and recreational fishing, the effects of runoff of silt, nutrients and contaminants from the land, and the provision of highly protected areas for biodiversity protection.

This reduces maintenance requirements and life-cycle costs. Because of its shape, structure, and frequency selective surfaces (FSS), the AEM/S System provides significantly reduced radar signature. The largest composite topside structure aboard a U.S. Navy ship, the AEM/S System was installed aboard the Spruance Class multimission destroyer USS Arthur W. Radford (DD 968) on 17 May 1997 to replace her main (aft) mast.
   The AEM/S System ATD is a vital component of the Navy's overall program to develop the next generation of surface combatants. Goals for these ships include signature control, reduced life-cycle costs, low-cost manufacturing, and enhanced sustainability.
   The AEM/S System is currently being evaluated for installation aboard the LPD 17, the Navy's next generation of amphibious transport dock ships.
   The AEM/S System provides the designers of next-generation ships with a demonstrated technology-and with a demonstrated methodology for implementing the technology-to help meet the navy's objectives for signature control, reduced life-cycle cost, and enhanced sustainability.

AB The first appearance of live termites or feeding damage in previously reported subterranean termite monitor designs occur within several months of installation and involves <15% of the total number of monitors. The ability of monitors to sustain subterranean termite foraging often is less than 50%. The design of the monitor used for this study, featuring above and below ground sections, sustained subterranean termite foraging for over 80% of monitors for both wildland and residential sites for at least 2 pears. The monitor is robust and can accommodate seasonal fluctuation in termite foraging activity. The modifications of this monitor and possible underlying mechanisms for increased sustainability of termite foraging are compared to already described collecting devices utilizing wooden stakes, toilet paper, corrugated paper, and belowground monitoring systems.

AB Poor bean yields in the Cunha region of the Mata Atlantica ecosystem in the state of Sao Paulo, Brazil, are associated with low agronomic inputs, plant disease, and soil erosion. To identify sustainable farming practices that increase production and maximize biological N-2 fixation (BNF), the effects of soil fertility and plant cultivar on seed yield and root nodule formation were measured under standard agronomic practices. Results from 16 sites showed that fertilizing with lime and molybdenum increased seed yields to 370% for the landrace Serro Azul. In addition to increased yields, plants grown with fertilizer had more nodules. Marked strains of Rhizobium tropici were tested under controlled environments. An indicator strain of Rhizobium containing the gusA marker gene was used. Our results verify that the indicator strain CM-255 GusA(+)Hup(+) had a high capacity to associate with the five bean varieties tested. Fertilization with P, K, S + micronutrients and liming were essential for better nodulation by the indicator strain. Under low fertility conditions, the landrace variety Serro Azul was poorly nodulated, when associated with native strains or with the indicator strain. However, under better soil fertility conditions, nodulation of Serro Azul by the marked Rhizobium strain was increased. The commercial variety Carioca 80SH showed no increase in nodulation (nodule number).

ID STREAK VIRUS
AB The parasitic witchweed, Striga hermonthica (Del.) Benth, is the greatest biological constraint for cereal crop production by resource-poor farmers in sub-Saharan Africa. Maize, Zea mays L., is a widely grown cereal crop in this region (22 x 10(6) ha). Striga-resistant maize populations were produced and tested as half-sib families in West and Central Africa. Three populations with white (W), yellow (Y), or mixed (Y/W) grain colour were formed by: (1) intercrossing Striga-resistant maize inbred lines followed by two generations of random mating; (2) testing under artificially induced S. hermonthica infestations in Nigeria, Cameroon, and Ivory Coast and selection of resistant families; (3) two generations of random mating; and (4) two years of testing for resistance. Striga-resistant synthetic W, Y and Y/W populations were produced by compositing resistant half-sib families. Outstanding performance in grain yields and host plant resistance was observed. Maize damage ratings and number of harvested ears were highly correlated with grain yield. High variation was observed for Striga emergence counts. The populations have combined resistance to Striga, maize streak virus (MSV), and other major biotic constraints for maize cultivation in Africa, thus providing the opportunity for improved sustainable maize production under stress environments. Breeder's seed of these synthetic varieties are being multiplied for distribution to national programmes.

AB Wastewater treatment and disposal has become a major component of policy-making subject, because of growing awareness of environmental quality issues. Agricultural use of treated effluents helps to maintain environmental quality, and simultaneously furthers other national goals such as providing sustainable agriculture while preserving scarce water sources. Another advantage of irrigation with wastewater is the possibility of decreasing the purification level and the derived treatment costs, thanks to the role of soil and crops in acting as a bio-filter. Also, using the nutrients available in wastewater may diminish fertilization costs. The considerations for policy decision making include many factors such as the level of purification, the location of agriculture and the types of crops. The regional dimension is reflected in the way the decision on where to convey the wastewater influences the choice of agricultural crops, the fate of aquifers and the related costs. For example, in Israel, wastewater treated in the center of the country may pollute the coastal aquifer, whereas conveying this wastewater to the south, where there is no active aquifer gives rise to increased conveyance costs and loss of agriculture in the center. In this paper a general methodology for environmental policy decision making in relation to wastewater is developed and applied in an Israeli case study. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Population polymorphism was studied in terrestrial mollusks of the order Geophila. Polymorphism patterns were analyzed in species from closely related higher taxa. Biological characteristics of the studied species, as well as the literature data on terrestrial gastropods, indicate that K-selection occurred in their populations. This type of selection determines a higher functional efficiency of populations in a biogeocenosis. In this case, the population gene pool accumulates, in the course of stabilizing selection, the genes improving fitness, which results in the formation of an integrated phenotype displaying the maximum possible adaptation. Thus, a colonial system of population complexes develops. a sustainable functioning of the population is ensured by maintaining the constancy of its characteristics, i.e., the population homeostasis. The corresponding characters and properties are formed and preserved in the course of phylogeny on the basis of morphological and physiological characteristics that are genetically determined and expressed during ontogeny of the given form.

AB Objective. A prospective randomized study comparing transurethral electrovaporization (TVP) vs laser ablation of the prostate was undertaken to compare the efficacy and safety of the procedures. Methods. A total of 31 patients underwent treatment, with 20 patients receiving electrovaporization sugrery and 11 patients undergoing laser treatment. Patients underwent initial evaluation consisting of an American Urological Association (AUA) symptom score, prostate specific antigen (PSA), uroflowometry, pressure flow, and transrectal ultrasound for prostate volume. Patients were seen in follow-up at 1, 3 and 6 months. Results. A total of 3 1 patients with a 2:1 randomization of TVP to laser treatment were enrolled. The laser patients had a mean pre-operative AUA symptom score of 19.0 and scores of 9.0, 6.0 and 5.0 at 1, 3- and ti-month follow-up. The TVP patients had a mean pre-operative symptom score of 22.0 and scores of 7.0, 8.0 and 5.0 at 1-, 3- and 6-month follow-up. Mean peak uroflow (PF) rate pre-operative was 10.7 for the laser group and 7.7 for the TVP group. At 1-, 3- and 6-month follow-up, mean PF rates of 13.3, 17.6 and 16.5 were present for the laser patients and 15.0, 17.5 and 14.2 for the TVP group. The differences were not statistically significant. There were 6 complications in the laser patients and 7 complications in the TVP group. Operative time was a mean of 27 min for the laser patients and 46 min for the TVP group. and the difference in operative time was statistically significant. Conclusion. At 6-month follow-up the improvement in symptoms score and peak flow rate are comparable in both treatment groups. The electrovaporization procedure required significantly longer to perform than the laser procedure. Long-term follow-up is required to see if these results remain sustainable for electrovaporization therapy.

AB This paper explores the concept of sustainable development and its ethical and public policy implications for engineering and multinational corporations. Sustainable development involves achieving objectives in three realms: ecological (sustainable scale), economic (efficient allocation) and social (just distribution). While movement toward a sustainable society is dependent upon satisfying all three objectives, questions of just distribution and other questions of equity are often left off the table or downplayed when engineers and corporate leaders consider sustainable development issues. Indeed, almost all the effort of engineers and engineering organizations on the issue of sustainable development has been focused on striking a balance between economic development and environmental protection. Similarly, corporate approaches rely on technological fixes to the challenges posed by sustainable development. While there have been some efforts aimed at incorporating environmental and social equity concepts into engineering codes of ethics, social concerns have been secondary to environmental issues. The incongruity between the ideal of sustainable development and the way in which it is typically characterized by the engineering and business communities has significant implications for engineering and public policy, engineering ethics, and the potential roles of engineers and multinational corporations as facilitators of a transition to a sustainable society.

AB A better understanding of the soil aggregation process is needed to address a variety of concerns, including soil quality and erosion, agricultural sustainability, soil C sequestration, the mobility of hazardous chemicals and remediation of contaminated sites. We used data from a chronosequence of tallgrass prairie restorations and a path analysis approach to evaluate how the lengths of two dia size classes of fibrous roots, the length of external mycorrhizal hyphae, microbial biomass C, hut-water soluble carbohydrate C and soil organic C interact to promote the stabilization of soil aggregates. The measured binding agents accounted for 88% of the variation in macroaggregates >212 mu m diameter and goodness-of-fit indexes indicated a good practical fit of the path model to the data. The restoration of macroaggregate structure in this system was apparently driven by the direct and indirect effects of roots and external hyphae, with lesser relative contributions by the three measured C pools. Although the two root size classes had similar direct effects on the percentage of macroaggregates, their indirect contributions differed substantially. Fine roots (0.2-1 mm diameter) exerted considerable indirect effects via their strong influences on external hyphae and microbial biomass C. Very fine roots ( < O.2 mm dia) made a stronger contribution to soil organic C than fine roots, but their overall indirect contribution to aggregation was minimal. In addition, the relative importance of each binding agent varied for different size fractions of macroaggregates and generally supported the hypothesis that the effectiveness of various binding mechanisms depends oil the physical dimensions of the binding agents relative to the spatial scales of the aggregate planes of weakness being bridged.

TI Soil water storage in dryland cropping systems: The significance of
   cropping intensification
SO SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
ID TILLAGE SYSTEMS; EFFICIENCY
AB Soil and water conservation is essential to the sustainability of Great Plains dryland agriculture. We hypothesized that cropping intensification improves the efficient use of precipitation. We evaluated long-term observations of soil water at three locations in eastern Colorado for a range of pan evaporations (1050-1900 mm), soils, and cropping systems, Soils at various locations were mostly of the Argiustoll subgroup except for one Ustochrept and one Haplargid, both at the higher evaporation location, Normal precipitation at the three locations ranges from 400 to 425 mm yr(-1). Systems included a 2-yr winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-fallow (WF) and more intense 3-yr winter wheat-corn (Zea mays L.)fallow and winter wheat-sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench]-fallow and 4-yr rotations. To quantify the effectiveness of the intensified systems at utilizing precipitation, we introduce the System-Precipitation-Storage Index (SPSI) and System-Precipitation-Use Index (SPUI), Mean SPSI values were 0.19 and 0.28 for 2- and 3-yr systems, respectively, meaning that the fallow periods in the 3-yr rotation were collectively 47% more efficient at storing precipitation than fallow in WF, Inclusion of a summer crop, such as corn or sorghum, increased the fraction of precipitation allocated to growing-season crop production (i.e., SPUI) from 0.43 in WF to 0.56 (i.e,, an increase of 30%) in 3-yr systems. The gains in efficient use of precipitation with intensification resulted from (i) reducing the frequency of the inefficient fallow preceding wheat, and (ii) using water for transpiration that,would otherwise be lost during fallow through soil evaporation, runoff, and deep percolation.

AB Coal mining in Mpumalanga is beset by a major problem, the generation of large quantities of mine water saturated with gypsum (CaSO4) and high levels of magnesium sulphate (MgSO4). Experience, gained at the Kromdraai opencast section, of Landau Colliery, has shown that such water can be used in the short term for agricultural purposes and model predictions indicate that this may also be a sustainable practice.

AB This study examines whether first-mover and early-mover advantages can be sustained in an industry where the barriers to entry are generally low and new product innovations can be easily imitated-namely the money market mutual fund industry. Using a simultaneous-equation supply-and-demand model of panel data from a variety of money market fund product categories, the study finds that first-movers and early-movers enjoy both a highly sustainable pricing advantage and a moderately sustainable market share advantage. These counterintuitive results are interpreted in terms of the structural characteristics of demand in the industry. implications of these results for the ongoing debate between the 'sustainability' and 'hypercompetition' perspectives are discussed.

AB Improvement of the economic return and the enhancement of the sustainability of wheat production depend on weed control. Cheat, Bromus secalinus L., is one of the most serious weeds infesting winter wheat (Triticum Aestivum L.) fields. One way to control cheat will be to separate cheat from wheat in the combine and mechanically devitalize the seed. Two mills, a roller mill and a hammer mill, were investigated for their ability to damage, but not grind cheat seed to reduce its viability. Milling effects on cheat germination were evaluated in greenhouse pots, in a laboratory growth chamber and in the field. Roller mill variables tested were the gap between rolls (from 0.1 mm to 1.1 mm) and the density of teeth on the rolls (5, and 8-teeth/cm). Germination decreased with decreasing roll gap and increasing Poll tooth density. The hammer mill dehulled the seeds and fractured 92% of the seed embryos. Hammer milled seeds had lowest germination and the most mechanical damage. The combination of narrowest roll gap and higher tooth density yielded germination reduction that was statistically equivalent to the hammer mill treatment The field tests results were similar to the laboratory tests but intervening natural factors reduced germination for all treatments. Results demonstrated the feasibility of substituting mechanical seed devitalization for herbicides to control weeds in wheat.

TI Sustainable transport: the role of the bus in the post-competitive
   market
SO TRANSPORT REVIEWS
LA English
DT Article
ID DEREGULATION
AB The bus is the most viable form of urban public transport and has to play a major role in the delivery of sustainable transport objectives. It cannot do so under current models of operation and legislation outside London. Quality Partnerships are not the answer. This paper looks at and contributes to the debate about alternative models. It analyses the attributes needed for such models but does not recommend the final model form. It starts from the premise that the bus market is rapidly consolidating, with attendant effect on competition. Indirect or push variables are more effective than direct or pull variables in mode switch from car to bus. Central government has a crucial role in delivering Marginal Cost Equalization. Fuel duty increases have applied to bus and car, so there is no equalization at the margin. Comparison of the models in and out of London shows that both have had similar effect on unit cost, extra mileage and reduced subsidy but are different in terms of changes to passengers and passenger revenue and how the net effect is shared between society and bus operators. It is argued that, as maximizing profit and passengers is different, fare and service level need control and public investment in bus priority should not leak into higher profits. Positive feedback is needed between higher bus use and revenue and investment in further measures to increase use. Demand management measures, such as increasing car-park charges, have a political cost; this political price may be willingly paid to achieve transport objectives but not to boost operators' profit. Comparison is made with rail where Marginal Cost Equalization is delivered and fares and service are regulated. The role of central government as a third partner with bus operators and local government is emphasized. If profits are judged to be excessive, such as Railtrack in the July 1997 budget, windfall taxes may be justified, but regulation to keep the money in the transport industry may be a better way forward. This paper was prepared whilst the White Paper was being consulted on, but is published between the White Paper and the parliamentary Bill. If the White Paper has not addressed all the issues raised here, it is hoped that readers persuaded of their validity may try to influence the drafting of the Bill and amendments during its progress through Parliament.

SO TRIMESTRE ECONOMICO

DT Article
AB In this paper, we derive three lessons from Mexico's experience. First, deep reforms like trade liberalization are not likely to happen by government decree. Instead, they usually come about when the unanimous blocking of reform by powerful elites breaks down. In the case of Mexico, this happened during a fiscal crisis, when some groups tried to displace other groups in order to capture a greater share of fiscal revenue. Second, in the presence of entrenched elites, the sustainability of reform depends on the existence of new groups that benefit from the new status quo and have enough power to defend it. Thus, the speed of successful reform is determined by the speed with which new groups are consolidated. Initially, Mexico limited radical liberalization to the manufacturing sector. The government has only recently begun to undertake serious liberalization in the services and agriculture sectors. The third lesson we take from Mexico is that the importance of formal agreements like NAFTA lies not so much in the ability of these agreements to reduce average import tariffs among their parties and improve their terms of trade vis ci vis the rest of the world, as claimed by the optimal tariff literature, but in that they serve as commitment devices to force reforms to continue.

AB Within the framework of the Dutch Priority Program on Acidification, 10 yr of research was conducted in a Douglas fir stand at Speulder forest. Research was conducted to establish the loads and levels of acidifying and eutrophying pollutants and ozone, to determine forest vitality characteristics and follow growth parameters and nutrient status in time and to determine the effects of reduction of loads and levels by manipulation experiments. Results indicate that during the last 20 yr critical levels for air pollutants have hardly been exceeded except for ozone, which slightly affected assimilation. Elevated nitrogen deposition has caused several adverse effects including (i) inhibited mycorrhizal development, leading to a decreased base cation and phosphorus uptake; (ii) elevated foliage/root (fine and coarse) ratios, making the forest more sensitive to drought and windthrow; (iii) elevated nitrogen and arginine concentrations in the foliage, associated with relative base cation and phosphorus deficiency, and (iv) elevated nitrate leaching polluting the groundwater. High inputs of acidity have caused elevated ratios of Al to base cations, affecting fine root (uptake) and depletion of the readily available Al pool, thus affecting the long-term sustainability. Despite these effects, forest vitality, in terms of defoliation/discoloration, is reasonable and forest growth even increased in response to nitrogen. The exceedances of critical loads for nitrogen and acidity, however, implies a (large) risk for the long-term sustainability of the Speulder forest.

AB The author explores the impact of financial internationalization on prospects for sustainable democratic developing in non-OECD countries. Existing arguments rest on changes in relative factor scarcity drawing from neoliberal trade theory, on governments' decreasing ability to tax increasingly mobile capital, on volatility of flows and on the rising intensity of the "market as prison" phenomenon first identified by Lindblom in a domestic context. The causal logic implied in these different arguments is not consistent with evidence on the determinants of North to South financial flows. A survey of empirical literature on capital flows, organized by a simplified capital asset pricing model, suggests that to the extent international investors in developing countries act rationally, they respond to international liquidity and global interest rates more than the specific actions of host country policy makers. Investor herding and poor information also weaken the chains that supposedly bind Third World governments in an increasingly internationalized world. Financial internationalization does constrain capital-poor countries, but not in the ways alluded to in existing literature. The author concludes by stipulating several hypotheses about the causal link between financial internationalization and social democracy in emerging market countries that are consistent with empirical evidence on the determinants of North to South capital flows.

AB Soil is widely recognized as one of the most complex systems present in the universe. It's highly non-linear and heterogeneous nature as well as the interacted and coupled physical, chemical and biological processes and phenomena occurring in the soil environment at different spatial and temporal scales are the main reasons for such complexity. As a consequence there is a need of appropriate methodologies and instrumentation to characterize soil porous systems either in the loaboratory or in the field. Moreover, the scientists and engineers face a great challenge to non-invasively measure and follow the changes occurring in soil systems caused by the human activities. Nevertheless, despite the enormous gap still to be bridged to better understand and manage in a sustainable way the new opportunities of soil resources for its characterization are nowadays available and should be exploited in soil science research. Those new opportunities are essentially interdisciplinary and are coming from other areas of knowledge such as space science, medicine, engineering and basic sciences. This paper will present examples and results and will present challenges and potentialities of new methods and instrumentation already available at different scales of observation. Spectroscopy, microscopy and high resolution imaging techniques including X- and gamma-ray and NMR tomography, atomic force microscopy and other recent tools will be shown. The characterization of macropores and preferential water flow infiltration in two and three dimensions were performed through the employment of commercial and dedicated scanners without disturbing the soil samples. The use of fractal geometry and a modified invasion percolation theory model were also employed to describe the "fingering" phenomena. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A culture system for the edible, red seaweed, Gracilaria parvispora Abbott (long ego), was developed in Hawaii that utilized a hatchery to produce tetrasporophyte and gametophyte life stages of the seaweed, reef growout of sporelings to harvest size adults, and multiplication of the harvested thalli in floating cages prior to sale. A central cooperative operated the hatchery and floating cages, and marketed the product. Sporelings from the hatchery were distributed to coastal residents who established patches of seaweed on the reef and sold their harvest to the cooperative. Mean relative growth rate of seaweed in the cages over 52 weeks was 2.64% d(-1) and productivity was 14.8 g m(-2) d(-1) (dry weight), within the range of intensive culture systems. Cage cultures were not sensitive to water motion over the range of 4-14 cm s(-1) but growth and productivity tended to be higher in summer and spring than in winter. The culture system potentially overcomes problems that have hindered development of a sustainable supply of this species: low availability of wild stocks due to overharvesting; low productivity of spore cultures; and deterioration of vegetative cultures over time. Some of the elements may be applicable to other areas where wild stocks of Gracilaria have been overharvested. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Wastewater aquaculture has been practiced throughout the world. Conversion of waste into usable resources, environmental protection internalized in the aquaculture procedure and sustainable development are its objectives. Its fundamental principles are holism, harmony, self-resiliency, regeneration and circulation. Its main guiding ecotechniques are series connections of food chains or production chains; parallel connection of originally independent ecosystems to create symbiotic networks; multi-layer and multi-step utilization of materials including products, byproducts and waste; promotion of effective and beneficial circulation; and restoration of ecosystems. This paper focuses on these principles involving several different patterns, demonstrating how these principles and ecotechniques are used in wastewater aquaculture in some pilot case studies in China, including stocking of filter-feeding animals; combining conservation with reasonable utilization of hydrophytes; fishery-cumhusbandry integrated system, duckpond integrated system; treatment and utilization of industrial wastewater by aquaculture.

AB As a result of deforestation, annual bush burning, overgrazing and intensive cultivation, most tropical forests have changed to derived savanna in many West African states. This change in vegetation has led to a decrease in rainfall and a change in many climatic conditions. Erosion problems have increased, soil fertility has declined in arable land and the soils have become compacted. Successive droughts and uncontrolled population growth have compounded the problem to the extent that traditional farming practices no longer ensure sustainability. Places where such deterioration of the environment has occurred in Nigeria and Ghana are highlighted Results of experiments which demonstrate that nutrient deficiency in the Sahel savanna is a more serious problem than low rainfall and that nitrogen and phosphorus are the limiting nutrients in many savanna ecosystems are reviewed. The roles played by trees in the savanna such as provision of shade, preservation of water, reduction of susceptibility to erosion and nutrient pump are highlighted and species whose cultivation must be intensified so as to promote sustainability in savanna ecosystems are listed. The principles of agroecological restoration of savanna ecosystems whose focus is on the restoration of ecological balance and which has been successfully practiced in Ghana are highlighted.

ID DECISION-ANALYSIS
AB Fisheries management is typically characterized by multiple and often conflicting objectives. The Western Pacific Regional Fishery Management Council (WPRFMC) is the authority for managing exclusive economic zone (EEZ) fisheries in Hawaii. The array of multiple objectives coupled with the heterogeneous composition of WPRFMC creates a complex decisionmaking environment for fishery management in Hawaii. In this paper, we applied the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) to evaluate four alternatives for limiting entry of longliners into the Hawaii pelagic fishery. We first elicited the factors deemed to be important for a sustainable pelagic fishery using a questionnaire survey, followed by another questionnaire to elicit judgments from all of the individuals involved in the decision-making process of WPRFMC. While there is considerable variation among individuals, the overall weighting of objectives and ranking of alternatives is robust in the sense of being consistent across all four bodies of the WPRFMC. There was no statistical difference in mean results among the WPRFMC bodies at the 5% level. This experience demonstrated an application of the AHP process in fishery management. The results of the present evaluation of the alternatives for limiting entry of longliners are comparable to earlier decisions. As compared to conventional decision making, this process has the advantages of timeliness, quantification, and documentation. It may also provide policy analysts with insights into potential conflicts and tradeoffs before the decision-making process unfolds. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Within the framework of a programme on the functioning of dense moist evergreen forests of the Western Ghats, the French Institute of Pondicherry, in collaboration with the Karnataka Forest Department, installed permanent plots to monitor the dynamics of a low elevation forest. The preliminary results of the comparison of the demographic processes in two compartments are presented: one compartment had never been harvested, while the other was selectively felled in 1979-1980. They are compared in terms of species composition, recruitment, mortality and individual growth, in order to describe the natural forest dynamics and evaluate the impact of selective felling. In both compartments, the mortality rate, around 0.9% yr(-1), is lower than in other tropical moist evergreen forests, while the average diameter increment, at 2.1 (unlogged stand) and 2.9 mm yr(-1) (logged stand), is higher. The impact of selective felling, 10 to 15 years after the harvest, is mainly noticeable: (i) on mortality of trees with dbh > 40 cm belonging to lower canopy and intermediate stratum species which died about four times more in the logged compartment; and (ii) on diameter increment of emergent and upper canopy tree species whose growth is still stimulated by about 50%. Despite the general trend of a reduction in the difference between the density and the basal area of the two compartments, medium-term modification of the demographic processes among the various structural ensembles in the logged compartment, indicates that selective felling may not be sustainable in the long-term without consequences on the forest structure and composition.

AB The objective of this study was to examine a new resampling methodology for estimating reference levels of Cs-137 in uneroded locations. Accurate and precise measurement of Cs-137 is required from reference locations to estimate long-term (c. 40 years) sediment redistribution (SRD) and landscape stability. Without reliable long-term, quantitative erosion data it is extremely difficult for land managers to make optimal decisions to ensure landscape sustainability. To determine the influence of Cs-137 reference site sampling, particularly undersampling, on SRD and landscape stability, two statistical approaches were applied to a grid-based data set. Caesium-137 inventories in the reference location (n = 36) indicated that data were normally distributed, with a mean inventory of 2150 +/- 130 Bq m(-2) (+/- 95% confidence band) and a coefficient of variation of 18%. The two approaches used to determine the effect of under sampling included: (1) one-time random subsampling from the total sample collected, subsamples ranged from n = 3 to n = 30; from these data means and parametric confidence bands were calculated; and (2) random subsamples (n = 3 to n = 36) were selected from the total Cs-137 reference sample, and each subsample was in turn resampled 1000 times with replacement to establish a sampling distribution of means. Thus, an empirically derived mean and 95% confidence bands were established. Caesium-137 activities determined from each approach were input into equations to estimate SRD from two cultivated fields. Results indicate that the one-time random sampling approach for subsamples of size less than or equal to 12 significantly over-or under-estimated net SRD, particularly from the gently sloping agricultural field. Computer-intensive resampling produced significantly better estimates of net SRD when compared with the random one-sample approach, especially when a subsample of size three was used. Landscape stability, based on partitioning the agricultural fields into areas exhibiting erosion, stability and deposition, was better approximated for both fields by applying resampling.

ID FRAMEWORK
AB The creation of a more sustainable countryside has become a very important item across the world. Several methods, approaches and policies can be applied and agencies, interests groups etc. can become active in this regard. Land-use planning, as one of these activities, is challenged to play an active role in obtaining sustainable rural systems. The paper focuses first on what land-use planning is and what the different steps are or can be in the process of planning the future uses of land. Secondly, it demonstrates the approach through so-called spatial concepts. Three examples are explored: the segregation vs, the integration concept; the concept of the framework planning; and finally, the concept of ecological networks or infrastructure. Finally, the way in which these spatial concepts are or can be applied, is discussed. included are some critical remarks with regard to the application of spatial concepts in land-use planning, together with the introduction of a new phenomenon in land development policies: that of the rural renewing.

AB The study deals with the value of traditional housing and settlements in the countryside. It is argued that for the sustainable development of rural settlements at least four characteristics should be protected: balance between nature and built-up area; historic traditional entities; local communities; the countryside as all own culture. To study the value of the traditional natural system in housing and settlement, three levels have been investigated: the use of natural materials, the design of traditional-functional houses and the function of settlements. It was found that the analysis can be applied to areas that are under reconstruction or redevelopment. It can even save some 35 - 50% of investment costs. Finally, it can play an important role in sustainable improvements. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Sustainable land use planning requires an in depth analysis of the existing resources (localization, features, sensitivity to development) and an understanding of development characteristics (resource needs and collateral effects) in order to identify an use for the natural resources that will not prejudice future development. Activities must be developed where the necessary natural resources exist and only when the environment is capable of absorbing the impact of the development. In this context, various methodologies have been developed for determining a rational use of existing resources that anticipates the possible long-term effects on the environment of the decisions taken and that takes into consideration all the existing relations between the natural resources and the planned operations. Some of these methods use the 'threshold' concept to establish the limits of the environment's ability to support the planned development. One of these methods is the UET (Ultimate Environmental Threshold), developed and applied during the creation of the Regional Plan for the Tatry National Park with the aim of identifying the environmental thresholds for tourism. The present study is concerned with evaluating the possibility of extending the application of the method to an area, such as the 'Parco del Serio' (Italy), characterized by an environment rich in natural features but profoundly modified by human intervention, in order to define a 'plan of the environmental preconditions' to be adopted during a sustainable planning process and which indicates the restrictions and the potential for development of human activities (with particular regards to tourism and recreational activities) in relation to the existing environmental resources and the ecological stability of the territory. This application of the UET method made use of the GIS (Geographical Information System) technology for the analysis and processing of the data acquired and the presentation of the results.

AB The aim of this paper is to demonstrate a method that includes explicit aims of both nature conservation and environmental protection in the management strategies of agricultural systems. Following methods of land use planning and farming systems analysis a decision support system was developed to simulate sire specific cropping practices and assess the impacts on natural resources. The optimization of farm income under defined restrictions of nature conservation and environmental protection completes the decision support system. The paper presents the general modelling approach and elaborates as an example the modelling of cropping practices. Cropping systems are modified to protect amphibians as a typical group of endangered organisms in agricultural landscapes. Evaluation tools are presented to assess the impact of defined production techniques on indicators of sustainable land use. The indicators are nitrate leaching, impact of land use on amphibians and gross margin of the crop production. The implementation of the evaluation tools on the land use of a model farm in northeast Germany is presented. Spatial allocation of target values is presented for one crop as an example. The site specific comparative advantages of the different cropping systems with regard to the indicators provide a basis for integration and optimization of a set of goals into land use practices on a larger scale, e.g., an agricultural landscape.

DE morphometric analysis of georelief; geometric form; chernozem;
   anti-erosion protection
AB An attempt to use the morphometric georelief analysis for diagnostics and mapping of water erosion-affected soils is presented. Four geometric georelief forms have been tested in various transsections in the homogeneous soil space of haplic chernozems in Pohronska pahorkatina (loess slightly undulated hills) which is affected by water erosion processes. Geometrical forms of the georelief have been constructed by the graphic-numerical way on the base of analytical graphic outputs of these morphometric parameters: null normal curvature of the georelief, null horizontal curvature of the georelief and slope of the georelief in the direction of orthogonal lines. We have tried to find out the extent of water erosion influence on soil properties of recent chernozems in Slovakia. Detailed soil survey and measurements in all geometric georelief forms enabled us to make four degrees of classification of potential water erosion risk of chernozems. Results of our investigations allowed us to conduct mapping of loess chernozems with more accuracy and precision and to propose anti-erosion protection arrangements within sustainable farming.

AB A survey was made of regrowth in Tarconanthus camphoratus stands of up to 10 years age since first coppicing, 5844 stems from 226 trees were measured. Woody biomass was shown to increase with age at a rate of between 124 and 335 kg fresh wood ha(-1) month(-1), Expressed as yield per month receiving >50 mm rainfall, the most accurate biomass predictor, the figure is between 292 and 670 kg ha(-1) month(-1). Maximum rate of regrowth occurred between 5 and 8 years after coppicing, Stems of diameter 20-50 mm (the optimum size for fuelwood) comprised 41.6% of the total number 10 years after coppicing while stems of diameter 40-70 mm (the optimum size for charcoal) comprised 10.1% of the total number after the same period. These results provide a basis from which to calculate the sustainable exploitation of T. camphoratus. In this way, the rapid draw-down of old growth forests for fuelwood production may be reduced.

ID OBJECT-ORIENTED SIMULATION; DYNAMICS; GROWTH; AGRICULTURE; TEMPERATURE;
   COMPETITION; SCALE
AB Problems of global change and sustainable agriculture have motivated systems analyses that span increasing numbers of hierarchical levels. The reuse of existing simulation models in these expanded analyses is appealing, though experience with crop models shows that the design of the models call limit their reuse. In order to avoid these design problems, a new framework for systems analysis was developed based on hierarchy theory. The framework formalizes a metaphor used to define hierarchy: each hierarchical object (holon) is analyzed and modeled with two faces, named up and down, through which the object can communicate data; up is a portal for data exchange with the next higher level and down provides data exchange with the object's subsystems, which are also holons. This generic model of hierarchy was coded in object-oriented computer languages and was developed into a programming framework named JanuSys. JanuSys organizes communications between modeled holons and provides an orderly sequence to their simulation. The framework permits dynamic creation of a user-defined number of hierarchical levels, containing user-defined numbers of subsystems in each holon. These capabilities, combined with the generic model of hierarchy, are required for testing basic theories of hierarchy and systems evolution. If hierarchy theories are correct, JanuSys will provide a more successful foundation for systems analysis than non-hierarchic approaches. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study was conducted to compare the effects of different harvesting patterns on grasslands and shrublands in order to suggest sustainable patterns for biomass fuel harvesters. Half-yearly harvest reduced the percentage cover of the vegetation from 96% to 83% over 2 yr. Yearly and half-yearly harvest eliminated four and five species, respectively. More species were observed on the uncut than on often-cut hills. Shoot densities under harvest increased over 2 yr. The aboveground biomass (AB) under yearly and half-yearly harvest declined significantly from 610.2 and 610.1 g m(-2) in August 1989 to 261.8 and 143.9 g m(-2) in August 1991, respectively. AB was higher in August than in February under half-yearly harvest and on the uncut than on often-cut hills. Moderate harvest increased aboveground biomass increment (ABI) with the largest 2-yr-long ABI (28 g m(-2) month(-1)) for yearly harvest. ABI was larger from mid-February to mid-August than from mid-August to mid-February. Under half-yearly harvest from mid-August 1989 to mid-August 1991, aboveground nutrient storage decreased significantly from 3691 (N), 323 (P) and 4996 mg m(-2) (K) to 1081 (N), 108 (P) and 932 mg m-2 (K). It was higher in August than in February. Yearly harvest had the highest 2-yr-long photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) conversion efficiency (0.26%) and 2-yr-long aboveground N, P and K increment (195, 18 and 207 mg m(-2) month(-1), respectively). PAR conversion efficiency and aboveground nutrient increment were higher from mid-February to mid-August than from mid-August to mid-February. Biyearly to yearly harvests from August onwards are sustainable patterns. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Extreme erosional events and their role in mountain areas of northern
   Spain
SO AMBIO
LA English
DT Article
ID GEOMORPHIC PROCESSES; SPANISH PYRENEES
AB The occurrence of extreme erosion events is governed by a complex mixture of climatic and geomorphological parameters. The high spatial and temporal variability of precipitation makes erosion events individually difficult to predict in advance, although it is clear that some areas combine many of the factors favorable to extreme erosion. Such events can have far-reaching effects on local morphology and landscape, changing channel systems and modifying the landscape, and in so doing damaging infrastructure, at a high financial cost. As we have recently seen, in human terms the cost can also be high. In order to ensure sustainable development in the Pyrenees, the possible impacts of extreme rainfall and erosion events must be considered in the context of recent changes in land use and management. This paper summarizes knowledge about extreme erosion events in the Pyrenees using recent and historical examples and suggests a way forward for risk assessment.

SO AMBIO
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper is based on the National Report which was prepared for the European Inter-Governmental Consultations on Sustainable Development of Mountain Regions in 1996, by a team of experts led by the author. Of the subjects (states) of the Russian Federation 43 out of 89 include mountain regions. However, this was the first time these issues were discussed at the federal level. In European Russia, mountains are located on the periphery of the Russian Plain, which is the historical and economic center of the country. Seventeen subjects (states) are located in the three main mountain massifs of the Caucasus, Urals, and Khibins. The paper provides an analysis of the current social, economic, and environmental status of the mountain regions, and of their development problems. It provides recommendations on priority research, policy, institutional activities, and international cooperation that are required for the sustainable development of the mountain regions of Russia.

TI Effect of several interventions on the frequency of handwashing among
   elementary public school children
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF INFECTION CONTROL
LA English
DT Article
ID INFECTION; IMPACT; RISK; CARE
AB Background: The purpose of this educational project was to assess the effect of several interventions on the frequency of handwashing among elementary public school children.
   Methods: Participants in this project were first-graders and fourth-graders from jurisdictions within a mid-Atlantic metropolitan area. Phase I included a baseline assessment of bathroom cleanliness as well as adequacy of supplies for handwashing in each school. During phase 2, the frequency of handwashing before lunch or after bathroom use was monitored and recorded during a 2-month period. The schools were separated into four groups: a peer education group, a hand wipes and instructional poster group, a combination of the education and hand wipes/poster groups, and a (control) comparison school.
   Results: Overall, a significant increase occurred in the proportion of handwashing frequency from preintervention to postintervention for each intervention group (wipes: 0.50 vs 0.66, p = 0.03; education only: 0.64 vs 0.72, p = 0.02; and education and wipes: 0.45 vs 0.67, p = 0.03) but not in the control group (0.42 vs 0.46, p = 0.26). When the first 3 weeks and the last 3 weeks after intervention were compared, handwashing frequency remained unchanged in the wipes only group (0.66 vs 0.66, p = 0.96), decreased in the education group (0.77 vs 0.65, p = 0.006), and increased in the education and wipes group (0.58 vs 0.75, p = 0.003), as well as in the control group (0.37 vs 0.52, p = 0.01).
   Conclusion: Education combined with accessible convenient hand hygiene may result in a sustainable increase in the frequency of handwashing among elementary school children.

AB The concept of index catchment development provides a holistic approach for optimizing the use of land and water, so as to prevent soil erosion, improve water availability and increase fuel, foddder and agricultural production on sustained basis. In the Osian index catchment, adoption of various development activities during a five-year period increased the cropping intensify by 31.4% and forage yield by 1.97 t ha(-1). Construction of water harvesting structures helped to increase the recharge to ground water, as indicated by rise in static water level. Sediment deposition against loose stone check dams was 3.68 m(3) ha(-1) year(-1).

SO BEHAVIOUR

ID GROUP-SIZE; VERVET MONKEYS; PAPIO; POPULATION; KENYA; EVOLUTION;
   FERTILITY; DENSITY; FITNESS; DESERT
AB Establishing the importance of predation pressure in determining primate social structure has generated a great deal of discussion. However, the substantive issues in this debate have been obscured by a conflation of the respective roles of predation risk and predation rate as selective forces. In addition, the reported relationships between predation rate and both group size and body weight are likely to be confounded by the effects of reproductive rate and activity period. We propose that the level of sustainable predation rate for a species is determined by the rate at which it is able to reproduce, and that, within this constraint, a species adjusts its body weight and a population its group size so as to reduce predation rate to some tolerable level. In effect, the observed predation rate is the excess mortality from predation that animals are unable to control by adjusting their behaviour. This implies that there should be no relationship between predation rate and either group size or body weight, once the effects of reproductive rate and activity period are removed. We analyse data from the primate literature and show that reproductive rate is indeed the best predictor of a species' predation rate, and that the reported relationships with group size are entirely attributable to a combination of the inclusion of nocturnal species which do not use group size as an antipredator response and the confounding effects of reproductive rate. We discuss these findings in the light of current investigations on predation risk, and conclude that an understanding of the role of predation as a selective pressure on primates will only be achieved by attempts to study the factors that are important in determining a primate's perceived risk of predation.

AB As part of a broader study, the aim of which is to identify soil factors that might be associated with yield decline of sugar cane, microbial biomass and protease activities were examined in soil samples collected from seven paired old and new land sites in three cane-growing districts of north Queensland. No consistent changes in soil protease activities were observed, although some sites exhibited specific effects, as a result of extensive periods of sugar cane monoculture. Soil microbial biomass, however, was significantly lower in those soils where sugar cane had been grown for extended periods. The implications of a lowering of soil microbial biomass on sugar cane yields and sustainability are discussed.

AB Following the arguments of Nguyen Ngoc Hai (Monitor No. 34), organic agriculture in developing countries is in need of modern biotechnologies, such as genetic engineering. According to Vanaja Ramprasad, the justification emanates from the issue of overpopulation and, therefore, exclusively emphasizes the quantity of food production, A reductionist approach however based on the modification of organisms on a molecular level is detrimental to ecologically and socially sustainable food production in developing countries.

AB Integrated conservation and development programs (ICDPs) are large, complex experiments in managing natural resources for both biodiversity and economic benefits. Monitoring should be an essential element within these programs to provide information for assessment and adaptive management; however, selecting appropriate indicators and designing effective monitoring programs is difficult due to thier complesity. Useful native plants can make excellent indicator species for ICDPs because monitoring them provides information simultaneously on both ecological and socioeconomic change. In addition, monitoring useful species is necessary for establishing management plans for their sustainable use. On the Masoala Peninsula in Madagascar, site of an ICDP, we conducted household surveys and developed new ethnobotanical indices from selecting the most important plant species in different use categories from 105 forest products harvested destructively by local inhabitants. Unlike previous studies, use categories were defined non-arbitrarily as groups of substitution products (e.g., products that are equivalent in their specific usage. By comparing use and preference within groups of substitution products, it is possible to predict over-extraction of preferred species and resource switching to secondary species. Knowledge of substitution groups is thus a necessary prerequisite for selecting indicator species that will furnish early warnings of non-sustainable use. We identified 13 groups of substitution products covering the major household uses on Masoala. From these we selected the 25 species that were most heavily used or preferred. Following the use of these species over time will permit a detailed spatial and temporal analysis of change sin resource use patterns and harvesting impacts in response to the integrated conservation and development program ultimately allowing the test of the hypothesis that economic development linked to conservation promotes conservation.

AB There is a paucity of data regarding outcomes of Type 2 diabetes mellitus. A cohort of 447 Type 2 diabetic subjects (208 male, 239 female; age range 30-82 years, median 62 years; and of predominantly European origin) was characterised in a clinic survey in 1989. Individual status (dead or alive) at 1 June 1995 was ascertained. At 6 years, 289 subjects were confirmed as alive and 133 as dead-only 25 were untraceable. Of those subjects identified as alive, follow-up clinical and biochemical data were obtained for 253 (87.5%) individuals. Tn those subjects, glycated haemoglobin deteriorated from 63.1 +/- 18.7 mmol/mol haem in 1989 to 71.7 +/- 24.4 in 1995, P < 0.0001. An increased prevalence of retinopathy was evident at 6-year follow-up, 59.7% cases in 1995 compared with 39.5% in 1989, P < 0.001. Similarly there was an increased prevalence of coronary artery disease (CAD) (33.6 vs 18.2% of cases), albuminuria (26.5 vs 19% of cases. P < 0.001), and hypertension (71.5 vs 54.9% of cases; P < 0.001) in 1995 vs 1989, respectively. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that glycated haemoglobin (odds ratio (OR) for 18 mmol/mol haem change, 1.78; 95% CI, 1.15-2.85), hypertension (OR, 3.33; 95% CI, 1.40-8.41) and known duration of diabetes (OR for 7 year change, 2.12; 95% CI, 1.24-3.80) were predictors for development of retinopathy. There is therefore a deterioration in glycaemic control in Type 2 diabetes over 6 years and an increased prevalence of complications that present strategies in a multidisciplinary specialist diabetes clinic are unable to prevent on a sustainable basis.

TI Escavation-water harvesting in Sudano-Sahelian Nigeria: Problems and
   prospects
SO DISCOVERY AND INNOVATION
LA English
DT Article
AB Escavation water resources in Sudano-Sahelian Nigeria were investigated and found to have been only a recent experience in the history of the area. The study found that water from these sources were used variously in different communities with domestic irrigation, commercial (e.g hawking and laundering) recreational, industrial (e.g brickmaking and processing) and animal watering as the principal uses. Uses of escavation water has brought relief and relative prosperity to dependent communities through the extension of water supply in time and space. However, it was also found that many user conflicts exist over resource use. Such conflicts are the results of the absence of laws and regulations fashioned in the context of resource use history, relative high number of incompatible uses and the individual rather than communal uses of resources. The paper points out the need for policies and actions to guide resource use on the paths of sustainability and environmental rationality and suggests a participatory approach which values and incorporates the views of the beneficiary communities in policy formulation. The paper concludes that escavation water resources could solve water problems of the area in the long run if their provision blends scientific or technological requirements with socio-economic realities of beneficiary communities.

AB Africa's problems are broad and diverse. They range from illiteracy to malnutrition, from poverty to malnourishment. To many, disease and underdevelopment are synonymous to Africa Yet Africa has got some of the world's richest resources - natural or otherwise. Today, perhaps information is the most vital of them all. In this paper, we contend that electronic information networks can save the continent from this state of misery. Electronic communication as a vehicle for sustainable regional development holds unfolding opportunities for key areas of an economy - from agriculture to mining, from health to education, from transport to regional cooperation. Experiences from the eastern Africa region are presented.

AB Science and technology constitute the driving force behind sustainable socio-economic development. They are the crucial components in war against disease, hunger, poor housing, poverty and other conditions linked to Africa's inability to adequately provide basic human needs. Thus the African mass media also has the social responsibility to gather and disseminate appropriate science and technology information or news needed to accurately inform, educate and empower the public. In this particular case it means enabling members of the public recognise their role in prevention of diseases and promotion of health as individuals, families, communities, professionals, nations or regions, Thus, the need for well trained and highly motivated science writers is still unlimited in Africa.

AB The combination of a rising interest in sustainable natural resource use and the increasingly fractious nature of the interactions between developers and preservationists has led to renewed interest in the question of appropriate natural resource management. In this paper I consider the question of land development and preservation over time and under uncertainty. I first review the extant literature and then I discuss its shortcomings. Next, I propose a research agenda which will enable us to shed light on some important management questions faced by land developers. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

SO ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
LA English
DT Article
DE economics; consumption; welfare
AB The relation between consumption and welfare, generally assumed by orthodox economists, must be re-examined by ecological economists. Present attitudes towards consumption among the latter are often ambiguous, resulting in a modified form of consumerism. Yet questioning the often dubious benefits of consumption is as important for the environmental debate as emphasising its neglected costs. Beyond basic needs satisfaction, it is at most one's consumption level relative to others which counts for welfare, so that benefits from consumption cannot be increased in the aggregate. Thus there is much scope for reducing consumption (and thus, environmental costs) while increasing or maintaining welfare. Identifying those goods the consumption of which adds Little or nothing to welfare, and assessing the effect of reducing their consumption on resource use, natural and human, should be a major concern of an ecological economics aimed at promoting sustainable welfare.

AB Since 1990, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) has published a series of annual Human Development Reports (HDRs) in which the human development index (HDI) is computed for each country. This index has become an important alternative to the traditional unidimensional measure of development (i.e. the gross domestic product). Although the index still fails to include any ecological considerations, it has broadened the discussion surrounding the evaluation of development. Unfortunately, over the years, the HDRs seem to have become stagnant, repeating the same rhetoric without necessarily increasing the HDI's utility. This paper evaluates how well these reports have lived up to their own conceptual mandate and assesses the ability of the HDI to further the development debate. We find that the reports have lost touch with their original vision and the index fails to capture the essence of the world it seeks to portray. In addition, the index focuses almost exclusively on national performance and ranking, but does not pay much attention to development from a global perspective. We propose the incorporation of three simple modifications for the index as a first step to overcome these shortcomings. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Use of environmental functions to communicate the values of a mangrove
   ecosystem under different management regimes
SO ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS

DE mangrove management; environmental functions; valuation; sustainability
AB Mangroves are part of rich ecosystems providing a variety of environmental goods and services. Underestimation of their value and of the impacts of human activities is a major factor contributing to the widespread loss and degradation of ecosystems. Economists frequently receive the blame for such environmental ills, but it can also be argued that ecologists communicate inadequately their knowledge to decision makers and therefore have limited influence. This article links information supplied by ecologists to the information required for effective and efficient mangrove management. A key problem which ecologists face is the high degree of interconnectedness within and between ecosystems. This makes it difficult to predict what is going to happen, let alone understand what is going on. The concept of 'environmental function' is used in combination with system diagrams to address this problem. System diagrams are used to identify and assess goods and services produced by the system under different management regimes. These goods and services are then valued to enable assessment of the economic efficiency of the management regimes. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In a letter previously published in this journal, Rothschild (1992) [Rothschild, R., 1992. On the sustainability of collusion in differentiated duopolies. Economics Letters 40, 33-37] claims to obtain results in contrast with those obtained by Deneckere (1983) [Deneckere, R., 1983. Duopoly supergames with product differentiation. Economics Letters 11, 37-42]. We show however that, taking correctly into account non-negativity constraints on output, Rothschild's formulation yields the same conclusions as Deneckere's.

TI Rebuilding without restructuring the energy system in east Germany
SO ENERGY POLICY
LA English
DT Article
DE east Germany; energy restructuring; sustainable development
AB The east German energy system is in a process of being completely rebuilt. Unfortunately, the huge investments are not used for implementing a technical and institutional restructuring, which is needed in order to achieve energy efficiency. The energy system will, among others, maintain its inefficient structure with separate production of heat and power, The ongoing changes are limited to improvements of power plant efficiency in combination with a change from a system based on brown coal for both heat and power into a system in which the electricity production is still based on brown coal and heating is produced on oil and natural gas. This rebuilding will bring the CO2-emission down from 20 t/inhabitant in 1989 to 13 t/inhabitant in year 2010, which is still much higher than the EU average on 8 t/inhabitant, This article describes how a restructuring could bring the figure below 7 t/inhabitant. The lack of ability to implement this restructuring of the energy system is, among others, due to an ownership structure, where networks of companies own the entire production and distribution chain from oil and coal to electricity. In this ownership structure, energy restructuring strategies which decrease the consumption of oil and coal will reduce the profits. At the same time the potential regulator, the parliamentary system, is politically and economically interlinked with and dependent upon the established energy companies. Consequently, it is difficult to establish the regulation reforms which are necessary for restructuring of the energy sector. There is still a lot to be gained from a restructuring of the east German energy sector. This restructuring requires institutional reforms, where the public regulation processes become independent of the industry which should be regulated. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

DE estuaries; aquaculture; sustainable resource development; resource
   management institutions; India
AB The emergence of commercial aquaculture in estuaries along the coast of Karnataka, India, has resulted in the breakdown of traditional methods of resource management and adverse impacts on the coastal environment. Based on field survey, personal discussions and published literature, we analyzed the evolution of different market (economic), traditional, and regulatory institutions governing the use of estuarine resources in the study area over the last three decades, and identified the environmental and social impacts of this evolution. In the past, informal associations of farmers in the estuarine floodplains had managed lands for raising crops and brackish-water fish in a sustainable way. In recent years, under economic and political pressures, landowners leased their lands to commercial shrimp-producers. A rapid growth in the production of commercial shrimp, employment of unsustainable production technologies, and laxity in environmental regulation have caused negative ecological and economic impacts on communities dependent on estuarine resources. Through a recent order from the Indian Supreme Court, environmentalists and the affected communities have sought to ban commercial aquaculture in ecologically-sensitive areas. While this court order awaits implementation, several policy options are here suggested fbr local, state and central governments in India in order to protect the estuarine environment.

AB Wild animals often destroy standing crops and prey on livestock, causing economic losses to farmers. Crop and wildlife damage are becoming serious for many Indian protected areas, and this study aimed to characterize the problem in villages in and around the Sariska Tiger Reserve (STR), Rajasthan, India. Data were collected using a semi-structured questionnaire in 37 villages followed by a semi-structured questionnaire administered to 180 households, quadrat sampling and focus group discussions. Crop and livestock depredation evidently affected nearly half of the households in villages adjacent to the STR, but damage varied considerably amongst villages and with distance from the Reserve border. Wild animal distribution and protection measures which people adopted also influenced the damage. Nilgai (Boselaphus tragocamelus) and wild boar (Sus scrofa) were reported to be responsible for at least half of the total damage to the major crops caused by wild animals. Tigers and leopards were the main livestock predators; the former preyed mostly on larger livestock and the latter on smaller animals such as goats and sheep. More than two-thirds of the villagers spent considerable time and money guarding crops and protecting livestock. Guarding was the most popular means followed by physical fences around fields. In spite of damage to crops and livestock, the local people still had a positive attitude towards the STR, because of tangible benefits derived from the Reserve in terms of fodder and fuel-wood, and cultural/religious attitudes towards wild animals. Settlement of rights to collect fuelwood and fodder within the Reserve appears to be one acceptable measure to compensate for losses besides an immediate review of hunting policy. Suggestions given by local people to minimize losses have implications for the long term sustainability of the STR as a protected area.

AB The mid-Atlantic region of the United States has a wide diversity of natural resources. Human pressures on these natural resources are intense. These factors have resulted in the collection of substantial amounts of environmental information about the region by EPA (both Regional and Research Offices), other governmental agencies, industry, and environmental groups. EPA Regional Offices comprehend first hand the importance of environmental data and are extremely supportive of investments in these data. Environmental data are used prominently in a variety of strategic planning and resource management initiatives. In EPA Region 3, the use of scientifically-sound environmental data is, in fact, one of our strategic programmatic goals. Environmental information is captured and assessed continuously by Regional staff, sometimes working in partnership with other Federal and State agencies, to derive relevant resource management conclusions. The restoration goals for the Chesapeake Bay are based on environmental indicators and resulting data. Attainment of the water quality objectives for streams and coastal estuaries are predicated on monitoring data. Our initiative in the Mid-Atlantic Highlands area uses environmental indicators to measure the condition of forests and streams. Landscape-level indicators will provide unique opportunities for the use of data in planning and management activities in support of the principles of community-based activism and sustainable development. Significant value is added to these data during their use by Regional managers. Regional programs, such as the Chesapeake Bay Program and several National Estuary Programs, are founded in environmental data, Environmental information is used by the Regional program managers to ascertain whether programs are accomplishing their intended objectives. Finally, Regional programs provide a crucial means for disseminating this information to broad segments of the public, so that a better informed and educated client base for effective environmental protection will develop.

AB Ecological risk assessment and risk management call for "state-of-the-science" methods and sound scientific assessments of ecosystem health and stressor effects. In this paper recent developments of periphyton indicators of biotic integrity and ecosystem stressors of streams and wetlands are related in a framework of ecological metrics that can be used to quantify risk assessment and risk management options. Many periphyton metrics have been employed in past assessments of water quality and a periphyton indices of bionic integrity has been applied by the state of Kentucky. In addition, the sensitivity of species composition of periphytic diatom assemblages has been shown to respond predictably to ecological stressors so that specific pH, conductivity, and total phosphorus in wetlands and streams can be inferred with weighted average indices. Inference of nutrient conditions by diatom indicators of total phosphorus is shown to have: sufficient precision to be a valuable complement to one-time measurement of highly variable total phosphorus in streams. Quantitative indices of sustainability and restorability of ecosystem integrity are proposed, respectively, as the changes in ecological conditions that can occur without significant change in ecological integrity or changes that are necessary to restore ecological integrity.

AB Indicators of the condition and sustainability of agricultural lands in five mid-Atlantic states were measured in 1994. Indicators were selected to reflect crop productivity and land stewardship on annually harvested herbaceous crop (AHHC) land, which covers almost 10% of the land area in this region. Overall, condition of agricultural lands in the region is good. Crops generally yielded more than those grown in the 1980s, with a mean observed/expected yield index greater than 1. The mean soil quality index was slightly better than a "moderate" rating for crop growth. Almost 2/3 of the AHHC land is covered by crop rotation plans, with the remaining land mostly in hay fields. Insecticides were applied to less than 20% of AHHC land, and less than 20% of the land where pesticides were applied has high to moderately high potential for pesticides leaching into groundwater. However, integrated pest management (IPM) is practiced on less than 20% of AHHC land. Hay showed more efficient use of nitrogen than seed crops, and non-tilled sites, which are mostly hay, had more microbial biomass (suggesting more nutrient cycling) than tilled sites. This information could provide a baseline for a long-term monitoring program for agroecosystems in the region.

AB We define regional sustainability as the continuous support of human quality of life within a region's ecological carrying capacity. To achieve regional sustainability, one must first assess the current situation. That is, indicators of status and progress are required. The ecological footprint is an area-based indicator which quantifies the intensity of human resource use and waste discharge activity in relation to a region's ecological carrying capacity. If the ecological footprint of a human population is greater than the area which it occupies, the population must be doing at least one of the following: receiving resources from elsewhere, disposing of some of its waste outside of the area, or depleting the area's natural capital stocks. To achieve global sustainability, the sum of all regional footprints must not exceed the total area of the biosphere. This paper explains the mechanics of a footprint calculation method for nations and regions. As the method is standardized, the relative ecological load imposed by nations and regions can be compared. Further, a nation's or region's consumption can be contrasted with its local ecological production, providing an indicator of potential vulnerability and contribution to ecological decline.

AB The human carrying capacity for a region at a specified standard of living depends on the economic and environmental resources of the region and the exchange of resources across regional boundaries. The length of time that a human population living at a given standard can be sustained depends on the rates of use and renewal of the resource base. All environmental, economic, and social resources are produced as a result of energy transformations; therefore, the energy required for their production can be specified and evaluated in common terms by converting their energy values into emergy. Emergy is defined as the available energy of one kind, previously used up directly and indirectly to make a product or service. Its unit is the emjoule. Emergy values and indices are used to evaluate the resource base for Maine, a politically defined region, and to estimate its human carrying capacity at the 1980 standard of living and for possible future resource bases. Emergy indicts for Maine are compared with similar indices for Florida, Texas, and the United States to demonstrate variations in human carrying capacity and sustainability among different regions. The 1980 standard of living for Maine, Florida, Texas, and the Nation as measured by emergy use per person fell within a relatively narrow range of 3.4E16 to 4.3E16 solar emjoules y(-1). The human carrying capacity for a region is considered within a pulsing paradigm for sustainabilty and within the constraints provided by a renewable resource base. For example, in the short-term the developed human carrying capacity for Maine is largely determined by the fuel emergy inflow relative to renewable emergy resources. If purchased emergy inflows relative to Maine's renewable emergy increase to the average ratio for a developed country around 1980, the population living in Maine at 1980 standards could increase to 2.9 million or 2.6 times Maine's 1980 population. In contrast, the human carrying capacity based on Maine's renewable resources alone was 0.37 million people at the 1980 standard of living or 33% of the 1980 population.

ID UNITED-STATES; ENERGY
AB We examine trends from 1970 to the mid 1990's of some variables related to development and sustainability for Costa Rica, Korea, Mexico, the Netherlands and the United States: first, by calculating energy and agricultural efficiencies over time, second, by examining the environmental impacts of economic activities, and third, by estimating ecological footprints. We find that many "optimistic" arguments about sustainability have been misleading, and that there is little or no indication that we are becoming any more sustainable or even efficient. Total quality-corrected energy consumption has increased for all five countries and the renewable energy portion is decreasing. The efficiency of turning energy into both agricultural production and GDP has declined for all countries except for the US. In general, there is a remarkable linearity between resource use and economic and agricultural production over all countries and all years, suggesting severe biophysical constraints to sustainable objectives. On the other hand, per capita ecological footprints have decreased somewhat in Costa Rica, Mexico, and the United States, while national ecological footprints have tended to remain constant except for Korea. While there has been a reduction of specific pollutants in the United States, some of this has been achieved by exporting heavy manufacturing industries. We conclude that continued population and economic growth in each country is likely to make the achievement of any kind of 'sustainability' increasingly unlikely. Sustainability, if that is desirable, requires a very different approach than what we have undertaken to date.

AB Canada has established a National Ecological Monitoring and Assessment Network (EMAN). The Network's operating objective is to understand what changes are occurring in the ecosystems and why. Each site is designed to have long-term multidisciplinary monitoring programs in place with supporting research and manipulation experiments. About 85 sites have been incorporated into the network. A Directory of EMAN Sites is available and a list of the Goals, Objectives and Deliverables (GODs) for many sites is also available. Information can be obtained on the EMAN's website at http://www.cciw.ca/eman/. The network is operated in conjunction with a program of developing national environmental indicators, with increasing emphasis on indicators of sustainable development. A series of environmental assessments are being produced that are issue and/or area focused. The assessment are designed as support for policy decisions. The national coordinating office supports the overall program of data gathering, reporting environmental indicators and produce assessments.

DE BSE; beef; input-output; regional economy; rural development; exports
ID CREUTZFELDT-JAKOB-DISEASE
AB The BSE crisis raises doubts about the sustainability of current levels and patterns of beef production in Northern Ireland, a region with a heavy dependence on exports. This paper employs a regional input-output model to determine the full effects of a permanent fall in export demand for beef on regional output, income and employment in farming and the wider economy. The scenario examined, which assumed the withdrawal of Intervention buying, illustrates the dependence of the beef industry on BSE-triggered market stabilisation measures, without which more than 5000 jobs and pound 68 million in income would be threatened, The countervailing effects of possible increases in demand for beef substitutes are shown to offer relatively limited opportunities for employment: 600 jobs and pound 9 million in income. In view of the extent of the dislocation caused by BSE in the regional economy, it is concluded that rather than try to sustain the existing pattern of production with the present mix of support measures, additional agricultural and rural development policy responses are required, The logical aim of the new measures should be to promote structural adjustment in the beef sector, thus enhancing competitiveness by improving underlying regional comparative advantage in beef production and processing, (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

ID REQUIREMENTS
AB Results from an analysis of greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption during the life-cycle of carrots, tomatoes, potatoes, pork, rice and dry peas consumed in Sweden are presented and discussed. The life-cycle is delineated to the part of the production chain prior to purchase by the consumer. The study shows that emissions, expressed in g CO2 equivalents, are highest for pork and rice and lowest for potatoes, carrots and dry peas. The most important stages of emissions in the life-cycle are identified for each of the different food items, Crop farming is the most important stage for rice and tomatoes while rearing of animals is the most important stage for pork and storage is the most important stage for carrots. Comparison with an energy analysis shows that important stages in the life-cycle of food may be under-evaluated when energy only is accounted for. This may lead to a sub-optimisation of pollution control exemplified by the case of transportation. Also, it is shown that the choice of functional unit has a decisive influence on the outcome of the study. The recommendation is to compare whole meals, or diets with the same nutritional qualities. A comparison of four meals composed of the food items under analysis shows that a meal with tomatoes, rice and pork has nine times higher emissions than a meal made from potatoes, carrots and dry peas. Emissions of greenhouse gases from consumption patterns based on the food items analysed are compared with an assumed sustainable limit of greenhouse gas emissions. The conclusion is that current food consumption patterns in the developed countries exceed the level of sustainability by at least a factor of 4, Prospects for achieving sustainable food consumption patterns are questionable in view of current trends in food demand.

AB This paper reports on a research project which facilitated a group of socially committed educators to clarify the nature of their desirable futures and to identify their sources of hope. This work is set within the normative tradition of futures studies and an account is given of how the research process was arrived at and the way in which people responded to this. A participatory and experimental focus group format enabled participants to explore these issues in a fruitful and synergetic way. Key elements of their preferable futures and primary sources of hope are identified and then compared with previous research findings. Finally these concerns are located within wider contemporary debates about revisionary postmodernism, sustainable futures and the utopian tradition. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

DE solid waste management; environmental policy; Nepal
AB The solid waste management system in the capital city of Kathmandu has undergone many changes over past several years. Before the implementation of the GTZ supported project in 1981, waste management was the responsibility of the municipality and people. During the project period it became a responsibility of primarily the Solid Waste Management and Resource Mobilization Center (SWM-RMC), though the municipality also continued to be involved to some extent, However, the latter's role has become relatively more important especially after the termination of the project in 1993, Despite periodic changes in the management system, solid waste could never be effectively managed. This paper examines the weaknesses and strengths of the changing management systems and then suggests policies for sustainable solid waste management. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Despite significant successes in controlling a number of communicable diseases in low and middle income countries, important challenges remain, one being that a large proportion of patients with conditions of public health significance, such as tuberculosis, malaria, or sexually transmitted diseases, seek care in the largely unregulated 'for profit' private sector. Private providers (PPs) often offer services which are perceived by users to be more attractive. However, the available evidence suggests that serious deficiencies in technical quality are often present. Evaluations of interventions to promote evidence-based care in high income countries have shown that multi-faceted strategies which increase provider knowledge have had some success in improving service quality. A wider range of factors needs to be considered in low and middle income countries (LMICs), especially factors which contribute to discrepancies between provider knowledge and practice. Studies have shown that PPs, especially, perceive or experience patient and community pressures to provide inappropriate treatments. LMIC governments also lack the capacity to enforce regulatory controls. Context-specific multi-faceted strategies are needed, including the local adaptation and dissemination to providers of relevant evidence, the education of patients and communities to adopt effective treatment-seeking and treatment-taking behaviour, and feasible mechanisms for ensuring and monitoring service quality, which may include a role for self-regulation by provider organizations or provider accreditation. Developing, implementing and evaluating strategies to improve the quality of service provision will depend on the involvement of the key stakeholders, including policy makers and PPs, Focusing on studies from Asia, Africa and Latin America, this paper develops a model for identifying the influences on PPs, mainly private medical practitioners, in their management of conditions of public health significance. Based on this, multi-faceted strategies for improving the quality of treatment provision are suggested. Interventions need to be inexpensive, practical, efficient, effective and sustainable over the medium to long term. Achieving this is a significant challenge.

AB This paper assesses the impact of alliances or partnerships for health promotion in northern and southern nations, as described in published papers and through contemporary accounts of best practice. The balance of evidence from published literature and case study accounts is clear. Alliance or partnership initiatives to promote health across sectors, across professional and lay boundaries and between public, private and nongovernment agencies, do work. They work in tackling the broader determinants of health and well-being in populations in a sustainable manner, as well as in promoting individual health-related behaviour change. The greater the level of local community involvement in setting agendas for action and in the practice of health promotion, the larger the impact. Volunteer activities, peer programmes and civic activities ensure the maximum benefit from community approaches. In addition, durable structures which facilitate planning and decision-making, such as local committees and councils, are key factors in successful alliances or partnerships for health promotion. Suck mechanisms also support the sharing of power, responsibility and authority for change, the maintenance of order and of programmatic relevance, and allow local people one means of reflection and for dissent. At a national, regional, district, village and local community or neighbourhood level, this review found that the existence and implementation of policies for health promotion activities were also crucial to sustainability. The evidence from the review suggests the need for new 'social' indicators to measure the effects of health promotion. Indicators for success which focus only upon benefits for individuals cannot capture adequately the extent of the impact of the many and varied collective, collaborative health promotion initiatives, alliances or partnerships currently underway around the world. These have been shown to affect families, communities, institutions and aspects of the organisation of social and civic life. This paper posits the notion of social capital as one important new framework for organising our thinking about the broader determinants of health and how to influence them through community-based approaches to reduce inequalities in health and well-being.

AB Robert Netting had a central role in establishing agricultural anthropology. Many people lightly remember him as an astute ethnographer of farming communities, focused on analyzing the empirical details of changing patterns of household composition, land holding size and labor use. Yet during his career he was increasingly concerned about the sustainability of smallholder vs. conventional industrial agriculture models on a global scale. Thus, Netting also had an important role in laying the foundation for the development of an agricultural anthropology for the twenty-first century, an anthropology that shows how smallholders "balancing on an Alp" can help us to understand how we might balance on this planet. This paper analyzes Netting's contribution to the future of agricultural anthropology in three key areas: the environment, population, and agriculture relationship; farmer knowledge and epistemology; and models for global sustainability.

AB The development of culturally relevant indicators of sustainability and quality of life is a need frequently cited but rarely addressed in the social science literature. This article presents a method and a case study based on an applied ethnoecology approach and utilizing an adaptation of the Thematic Apperception Test. Pictures of scenes around the Manupali watershed in Bukidnon, Philippines, were used to elicit people's perceptions and assessments of different environmental features and agricultural practices. Informants' stories were scored based on dominant themes to identify indicators of sustainability and quality of life that are relevant for different ethnic, gender, and age groups. These contextually sensitive indicators, the authors conclude, differ significantly from externally defined indicators and vary systematically as a function of socioceonomic and sociodemographic parameters. Taking culturally relevant indicators into consideration can help shape development trajectories that local people can identify with and benefit from in the short- and long-term.

AB The studies carried out with rice (Oryza saliva L.)-wheat (Triticum aestivum L, emend Fiori & Paol.) system at 8 locations in subhumid ecosystem for periods ranging from 5 to 10 years indicated the possibility of substituting 50% N needs of rice through farmyard manure (FYM) at Ranjit Singh Pura, Palampur, Varanasi, Faizabad, Sabour and Raipur and through green-manure at Palampur and Raipur, In organic matter-rich soils of Pantnagar and clay-rich soils of Jabalpur, N substitution through organic sources was not possible without any significant adverse effect on system productivity. Yield advantages due to N substitution through FYM at Palampur and green-manure at Raipur were significant. Continuous rice-wheat cropping had variable effect on soil fertility, depending on soil type, nutrient application and productivity levels. Integrated nutrient supply generally had beneficial effect on soil fertility.

TI Health profile of the ageing population: the Swedish experience
SO INTERNATIONAL DENTAL JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB Sweden is demographically one of the oldest countries in the world. The average life expectancy is comparatively high. However, the total number of physical and mental disorders, which may affect the elderly, seems to be increasing and becoming more and more complicated to prevent and treat. The rapid changes in the human biotope, threatening the quality of life of Man, play an important role in this development. The elderly in the future will, thus, have a health profile which may differ significantly from that of today's elderly. As general health is largely dependent on the 'health' of the environment and oral health may be the mirror image of general health, dentistry has a key position and responsibility in the international action programme for a sustainable development (Agenda 21, UNCED, 1992). Therefore, traditional curricula in, for example, odontology should be supplemented with interdisciplinary courses with a focus on a holistic view of the human condition. In collaboration with UNESCO, such an educational programme has been developed at Goteborg University. It aims at assisting each person to take on an increased self-responsibility for his or her immediate environment and health ('individual Agenda 21'). At present, an educational network is being established in Eastern Europe, in collaboration with medical and odontological faculties at the national universities.

   environmental governance
SO INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL AFFAIRS
LA English
DT Article
AB The United Nations system is complex and its workings often seem muddled to the outside observer. The UN has struggled with this problem from its inception, sometimes successfully but often not Part of the difficulty lies in the increasing complexity of the issues being addressed internationally, including "sustainable development" The expectations raised by such an all-encompassing term are hardly achievable in immediate terms. This lack of clarity in the issues addressed through the UN is also reflected in its institutional structures.
   The story of Earthwatch is just one example of how the UN has attempted to bring clarity into its system. In this case, the aim was to bring together the most up-to-date scientific knowledge and make it policy-relevant on an ongoing basis. What seemed a relatively straightforward goal has instead been fraught with difficulties. In this article, I analyze these difficulties in terms of the relations between science and policymaking. Three distinct conceptual approaches have been taken to this relationship: the functional approach, the feeder-of-information approach, and the assessments-for-policy approach. Each has had a decisive influence on the practices of Earthwatch. I conclude that the most recent approach offers the best alternative to realizing Earthwatch's goal. However, much work remains to be done. To this end I suggest that further research is needed.

TI Affordable hydrogen supply pathways for fuel cell vehicles
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Fuel cell vehicles can be powered directly by hydrogen stored on the vehicle, or indirectly by extracting hydrogen from onboard liquid fuels such as methanol or gasoline. The direct hydrogen fuel cell vehicle is preferred, since it would be less complex, have better fuel economy, lower greenhouse gas emissions, greater oil import reductions and would lead to a sustainable transportation system once renewable energy was used to produce hydrogen. The two oft-cited concerns with direct hydrogen fuel cell vehicles are onboard hydrogen storage and the lack of hydrogen supply options. Directed Technologies, Inc., working with the Ford Motor Company under a Department of Energy cost shared contract to develop direct hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, has addressed both perceived roadblocks to direct hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. We describe realistic, cost effective options for both onboard hydrogen storage and for economically viable hydrogen infrastructure development.

AB All species of howlers are at risk due to habitat destruction. I review the three most serious threats to howler survival-agricultural disturbance, logging disturbance, and hunting-both in a general context and in species accounts. Withal, the adaptability of howlers has allowed them to be a widespread genus throughout Central and South America. Alouatta is especially adaptable due to its generalized folivorous diet. I discuss how this adaptability relates to survival in situations of habitat destruction. In addition, I examine howler preference for riverine habitats and their ability to capitalize on secondary forests and secondary growth. I take a practical approach, suggesting some solutions for species survival, which include habitat management and reintroductions. Successful conservation models highlighted are the Community Baboon Sanctuary in Belize, in which villagers manage their lands for the benefit of the black howler and for their own economic benefit from ecotourism, and a village-sustainable logging system in Quintana Roo, Mexico, which has reduced levels of deforestation while benefiting both villagers and howlers, as well as other wildlife. A successful translocation of black howlers in Belize in order to reestablish a viable population is also described. The paper concludes with further suggestions to encourage howler conservation.

AB In the span of years of seminars and lectures I have given on sustainable use of the planet, sustainable development, leaving a habitable planet for our descendants, and similar titles, a small but exceedingly vocal group has attempted, during the discussion period or the talk itself, to link sustainability with environmental extremism. Almost without exception, objections to sustainability have been without foundation. The most common accusations are that sustainability is: (1) a subterfuge to protect endangered species, (2) anti-technology, (3) anti-industry, (4) anti-humans, (5) anti-private property, and (6) anti-change. Consequently, stating what sustainability is not is often helpful, and repetition of it may be necessary, depending on the depth of the misunderstanding in the audience. This discussion covers some, but far from all, common objections to sustainability. As sustainability has become better understood, attempts to associate it with environmental extremism should have diminished. However, no reduction in these misunderstandings has occurred and, if anything, the intensity may have increased slightly. Generally, only a small percentage of audiences appear to be emotional about sustainability, and stating what sustainability is not may not change their opinion or even silence their opposition. However, other members of the audience may be informed by stating what sustainability is not.

ID FRAMEWORK
AB The Rio Earth Summit and publication and distribution of Agenda 21 (UN, 1992) have generated much activity in many nations to-wards development and implementation of community indicators of sustainable development (SI). In recent years efforts at development and implementation of SI have intensified at regional and urban government levels, although fewer efforts are evident at a rural community level. In response to initial ad hoc efforts, methodologies for SI construction are currently being proposed, tested and refined. Within this evolutionary process, increasing recognition is being given to the critical need for, and importance of, 'stakeholder' involvement in SI development and implementation. This paper critically reviews these and related efforts from the perspective of rural communities in Canada. The argument is presented that the process of development and implementation of rural community-level SI can significantly benefit from development and implementation of a methodological approach in support of principles and practices of effective stakeholder involvement. It is further argued that development of SI must be stakeholder-driven, and that a pivotal element in the SI development process is the facilitation of information sharing. The paper concludes with a proposal for an approach to stakeholder participation and information sharing achieved through research, testing and refinement, and integration of these concepts within the process of rural community sustainable indicator development.

AB This paper argues that the current debate on sustainability is obscured by a number of misunderstandings. These relate, first, to the ongoing dispute between ecologists and economists holding different visions about the limits of economic growth and the carrying capacity of the Earth; and second, to the discrepancy between theoretical sustainability and practical sustainability. The paper concludes that the current vagueness surrounding sustainability may be reduced by reframing the debate. It demonstrates that the dispute between ecologists and economists can largely be considered as unproductive because the only sustainability concept supported by theory is that of 'strong sustainability'. The paper argues further that the gap between theoretical and practical sustainability may be bridged by distinguishing three concepts which properly account for informational inadequacies and human preferences in the design of sustainability constraints. These are: the 'sustainable EUS' (Environmental Utilization Space), the 'measured EUS', and the 'chosen EUS'.

AB In this paper, we argue that environmental business performance indicators are substantially and qualitatively different to sustainable development indicators and thus require different approaches in terms of public consultation, scope of measurement, time scale and range of issues covered. It does so by first reviewing some developments within environmental performance indicators for industry and, after providing a definition of sustainable development, it argues for the necessity of including SDIs in business in a way that reflects the fundamentally different nature of SDIs in comparison to environmental performance indicators for industry. It exemplifies the differences by focusing on one often-missing aspect - Biological Diversity.

AB Since the discovery of oil, the United Arab Emirates has undergone a process of rapid development, increasingly affecting the ecosystems of the country. Limited scientific literature dealing with these ecosystems is available, although a process of comprehensive ecological research has been initiated over the last few years. Further information on the soils, vegetation, fauna and climate are required in order to initiate a process of sustainable use of natural resources.
   Abu Dhabi Emirate was surveyed for anthropogenic factors in its habitats using an off-road vehicle, a global positioning system (GPS) and satellite imagery. The emirate was divided into six geomorphological units. Livestock was found to be the most common anthropogenic factor and is believed to have caused degradation of the natural vegetation. Agriculture, silviculture and urbanization were common and caused habitat loss and fragmentation. Rubbish dumping, earth moving and car tracks were also widespread, whereas air pollution and fences were limited. Four of Abu Dhabi's geomorphological units were classified as low-impact zones, two as low- to medium-impact zones and one as a medium-to major-impact zone. Environmental Impact Assessments (EW) and detailed ecological research were suggested as future mechanisms to implement sustainable development, and livestock control was suggested as a tool for habitat restoration.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND WORLD ECOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE travel cost method (TCM); non-market benefits; Trinity River;
   eco-tourism; sustainable
AB California's Central Valley Project (CVP) was approved by voters in a statewide referendum in 1933. CVP referendum approval initiated funding for construction of important water development projects that had far reaching effects on regional water supplies. The construction of Trinity Dam in 1963 and the subsequent transbasin diversion of Trinity River flow was one of several CW projects that had noteworthy adverse environmental and regional economic impacts. The Trinity River is the largest tributary of the Klamath River, and has its headwaters in the Trinity Alps of north-central California. After the construction of Trinity Dam in 1963, 90% of the Trinity River flow at Lewiston was moved to the Sacramento River via the Clear Creek Tunnel. Before 1963, the Trinity River was a major recreation resource of Northern California. The loss of streamflow has had a marked adverse impact on Trinity River-related recreation activities and the size and robustness of Trinity River salmon, steelhead, shad, and sturgeon runs. Trinity River water produces hydropower during its transit via Bureau of Reclamation canals and pumps to the northern San Joaquin Valley, where it is used for irrigated agriculture. The benefits provided by Trinity River instream flow-related environmental amenities were estimated with the travel cost method (TCM). Trinity River non-market benefits are about $406 million per annum, while the social cost of sending water down the Trinity River ranges from $17 to $42 million per annum, depending on the exact flow. We also discuss the relative magnitude of Trinity River survey data contingent value method (CVM) benefits estimates.

TI Development peculiarities of peripheral desert settlements: The case of
   Israel
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF URBAN AND REGIONAL RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB Selected statistical time-series covering the 30-year period from 1965-94 were studied to determine general trends of both economic development and population growth of urban settlements in the Negev desert of Israel. The research indicated that in comparison with urban settlements located in central 'non-desert' districts of the country, peripheral desert localities tend to exhibit wider fluctuations of economic activity, unstable population growth, and an attenuation of general urbanization trends that manifest themselves elsewhere across the country. The research led to a set of analytical models designed to explain development peculiarities of peripheral desert settlements. In addition, several planning strategies were proposed, aimed at enhancing the socio-economic sustainability of existing settlements in peripheral desert areas and facilitating prospective urban development there. These include: (1) the establishment of development clusters consisting of urban settlements which share some essential interregional functions such as employment, educational, cultural, and recreational services and facilities; (2) the adoption of a system of progressive economic incentives to promote private investment in peripheral desert areas; and (3) stricter regulation of land use in the central, non-desert regions of the country. Although the present analysis was restricted to small and medium urban settlements in Israel, the mode of analysis and its practical applications can be useful for urban and regional planning elsewhere.

AB Sugar industries worldwide have increasing interest in the potential of near infra-red (NIR) analysis for cane and beet sugar quality testing, downstream sugar byproduct analysis, cane nutrition, soil fertility monitoring and screening for resistance to pests and diseases. In South Africa during the past decade, NIR spectrophotometers have been used to improve fertilizer use efficiency of sugarcane by matching the crop's nitrogen (N) requirement and soil N requirement to soil N mineralising potential and plant N status. Major benefits have been substantial savings in N fertilizer and reduction in the risks of environmental pollution.
   Recent developments include use of scanning NIR instruments for determining various constituents in cane juice, shredded cane, bagasse, raw sugar, and molasses. The use of NIR on shredded cane has been proposed as an alternative to direct analysis of individual cane consignments (DAC). Global calibrations developed for mixed cane juice and molasses constituents for daily process control management of raw sugar factories are also currently under investigation.
   Possible new applications of NIR include partitioning the N pool in the cane plant, estimating photosynthesis, predicting yield potential, screening for pest and disease resistance and measuring the sustainability potential of soils.

ID PACIFIC SALMON; FISHES; ONCORHYNCHUS; PARASITES
AB Stability of the Lake Michigan fishery for chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha at high levels became questionable after stocks declined dramatically following spring epizootics in which bacterial kidney disease (BKD) was a major factor, initially stocked in 1967. favorable survival and growth of chinook salmon through the 1970s led to increases in abundance and in popularity with anglers. Returns of chinook salmon improved annually until the late-1980s, when, with little warning, spring epizootics reduced the abundance of adult salmon by 50% or more. Reduced abundance of alewives (Alosa pseudoharengus), coupled with an increase in chinook salmon density and heavy parasite infection rates were hypothesized to have reduced chinook salmon growth and fitness and to have increased their susceptibility to BKD. Evidence of slower growth exists and low food availability may be the stressor that triggered the epizootics. Chinook salmon were a major component of the economic development, and subsequent hardship of the sportfishing industry on Lake Michigan. Sustaining the chinook salmon fishery at previous levels may require managing for high abundance of alewives, which may be inconsistent with overall fish community management goals, The future sustainability and role of chinook salmon needs to be reevaluated in the context of the entire Lake Michigan fish community.

AB Research was undertaken on the dimensions of the Aral Sea crisis with a focus on the region's sustainability. The expansion of irrigation and achievement of self-sustainability in cotton for the U.S.S.R, as a whole was found to have been reached at the expense of the region's food sustainability. The associated socio-economic processes involved decline in the standard of living, deterioration of health, growth of unemployment and outmigration from the affected region. These consequences are now complicated by the painful economic transition in the new independent states. (C)1998 Academic Press Limited.

ID RECLAMATION
AB Desertification is a severe environmental problem in north-central China, where deserts are expanding at an estimated rate of 2100 km(2) year(-1). The Chinese government approved plans to control 6.66 million ha of desertified land in 10 years. Techniques used include planting of trees, shrubs and grasses; land enclosure; irrigation; extraction of buried soils; and stabilization of dunes with straw checkerboards. These efforts are co-ordinated by the Institute of Desert Research of Academia Sinica (IDRAS). Some of the pioneering work was carried out at Shapotou and Yanchi Research Stations in Ningxia Autonomous Region. Community action is one of the cornerstones of reclamation. In 1978 the Chinese government initiated the Shelterbelt Development Program to form a 'Green Great Wall' of 35 million ha of trees stretching 700 km across northern China. Ar Shapotou, sand dunes irrigated with silt-laden water have developed 30 cm of minero-organic topsoil in 25 years. Using a chronosequence of these reclaimed soils, chemical analysis showed progressive increases in nutrients. These reclaimed areas produce high yields of cereals, vegetables, grapes and deciduous fruits. Use of straw checkerboards and planting of indigenous shrubs have established a stabilized ecosystem on mobile dunes of the Tengger Desert. In the Shabianzi Region 74 families in a resettlement project have worked collectively on sand stabilization and steppe reclamation. Farmers levelled dunes and manually excavated buried soils. A chronosequence of land reclaimed and cultivated between 1983 and 1991 showed sustainable increases in soil nutrients. Soil fertility in these reclaimed desertified lands is sustainable but places high demands on resources. These and other examples show what is achievable, but, unfortunately, desertification rates exceed reclamation rates. (C)1998 Academic Press Limited.

AB This paper makes a case for, instead of disseminating isolated technologies, adopting the farming systems approach to controlling desertification and sustaining dryland farming in the desert ecosystem of India. Unless assured of substantial increases in productivity, farmers will not adopt new technology. But synergistic integration of dryland farming with animal husbandry and amelioration of degraded lands in a farming systems perspective can only help raise the productivity in resource-poor regions to levels that may interest farmers. This paper discusses initial results of efforts to develop prototype farming systems for desert agriculture with built-in synergy. (C)1998 Academic Press Limited.

AB Temperate and semi-arid regions of Argentina are undergoing rapid habitat conversion as a result of several human activities (i.e. grazing, logging, agriculture, etc.). These arid ecosystems contain many endemic species and have played an important role in the evolution of South American biota. The Man and Biosphere Reserve of Nacunan (12,800 ha) is located in the central region of the lowland Monte Desert. The reserve is a stand within a highly disturbed matrix characterized by deforestation (i.e. mesquite, Prosopis)and overgrazing. Major vegetational and animal communities recovered after the reserve was fenced in 1972, and Nacunan thus provides critical data describing the recovery of biotic and abiotic components of the Monte Desert when anthropogenic assaults are minimized. Indeed, the Reserve of Nacunan protects many distinctive habitats of the Monte Desert, including mesquite forest, or algarrobal, and several representative animals of the South American biota (i.e. tinamous, rhea, marsupials, edentates and caviomorph rodents). Several research projects on community ecology, herbivory, disturbances, ecology and ecophysiology have been or are being developed in the reserve. Although the town of Nacunan lies within the reserve, the link between the research community and the local people has not been strong, persistent or effective. The reserve is the most important site in Argentina for monitoring the ecological health of the Monte Desert and for developing indicators of desertification. Its potential is great for long-term ecological research and for strengthening the infrastructure of science. Sustainable development in the next millennium requires integrating the activities of the research, local people, ranch landowners and governmental sectors so as to infuse science-based proposals into management and conservation initiatives.

DE communal farmers; Namibia; SARDEP; community-based organizations
AB Namibia is an extremely arid country with very low and erratic rainfall. It has a population of 1.7 million people; most Namibians are subsistence farmers living in communal areas that are underdeveloped and poorly managed. Most farmers raise livestock under harsh climatic conditions. The Sustainable Animal and Range Development Programme (SARDEP) helps communal subsistence farmers improve livestock production and range management. Work done by SARDEP concluded that communal farmers are poorly organized, unaware of participatory development and unfamiliar with the concept of self-help. SARDEP also suggests that sustainable livestock and range development in communal areas cannot be based on the conventional development approach. This top-down and input-oriented approach rarely meets farmer needs. In fact, the non-involvement of farmers in the development process leaves a wide gap of untouched development opportunities. To achieve sustainable development SARDEP decided to support a process that closes this gap between farmers and service institutions. SARDEP developed the 'negotiation approach,' which supports the empowerment of grassroots-level organisations, considered the prime movers for development At the same time SARDEP helps service institutions interact closely with target groups and reorient their services toward well-formulated farmer needs and demands. To allow such development to grow, SARDEP also contributes at the national level toward formulating a conductive policy framework for sustainable natural resource management.

DE Kenya; Samburu District; desertification; community action; sustainable
   wood harvests
AB The Samburu District is situated in the arid and semi-arid area of the Rift Valley Province of Kenya. The Lorroki Plateau in central Samburu acts as an important water catchment for the surrounding arid areas and serves as an area for dry season grazing for the Samburu people, who are pastoralists living in group ranches and whose trees and forests are managed as a communal resource providing grazing, firewood, building poles and medicines. Strong group rules enforced by appointed elders have traditionally been essential to the conservation and wise use of communal tree and forest resources. But these rules have been undermined by changes in resource management, forest use patterns, increasing population, overgrazing, displacements, droughts, cattle rustling and high urban demand for wood energy and building materials. These changes have led to desert conditions. For the past 2 years I have worked among the communities in interventions to combat desertification and have held seminars to sensitize communities and extension staff. Participatory rural appraisal methods and action plans have been drawn up to address range rehabilitation within denuded community lands. The people have formed rural conservation committees with defined responsibilities, and women are taking an active role in harvesting and marketing non-woody products like honey to earn income.

AB Ancient agricultural societies farming the same soils for centuries offer alternative knowledge for combating desertification. The resulting agriculture is sustainable as well as culturally and environmentally appropriate. This paper describes an approach to enabling one such system at the Zuni Indian Reservation, New Mexico. The approach links agroecology and ethnoscience research to grassroots community action. Agroecology research has revealed enhanced soil quality in traditional runoff agricultural fields, while ethnoscience shows a subtle understanding of local soils and geomorphology. The research supports community action by recognizing and valuing a local agricultural system so that solutions to land degradation can build on indigenous knowledge. (C)1998 Academic Press Limited.

AB This paper offers directions for the continuing dialogue between business ethicists and environmental philosophers. I argue that a theory of corporate social responsibility must be consistent with, if not derived from, a model of sustainable economics rather than the prevailing neoclassical model of market economics. I use environmental examples to critique both classical and neoclassical models of corporate social responsibility and sketch the alternative model of sustainable development. After describing some implications of this model at the level of individual firms and industries, I offer an ethical justification of the sustainability alternative that is derived from the same values that underlie traditional market economics.

TI The ethics of consumption activities: A future paradigm?
SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS
LA English
DT Article
AB Concern about the environment and sustainable growth has raised questions related to resource availability and limits regarding the ability of the planet to provide everyone with an improved material standard of living. Such concerns lead to charges that the industrialized world, particularly the United states, is living beyond its means and taking more than its share of resources to produce a life style that is not sustainable. Whether overconsumption is a legitimate problem and changing patterns of consumption are necessary are questions that need discussion. The Protestant Ethic provided moral limits on consumption during the early stages of industrialization in Western Europe and the United States. This ethic weakened during the development of a consumer society, prompting speculation that a new environmental ethic is needed to perform the same function in modern society.

AB The aim of this paper is to provide an assessment of a vulnerability concept for real deltaic "applications" using the latest available knowledge on processes and dynamics for the Ebro delta. The building blocks are the morphodynamic components, which are presented in terms of field observations, supplemented by numerical predictions at three time scales, and the vulnerability concept, which is quantified in terms of resilience and susceptibility using the morphodynamic information. The approach is then illustrated (in conceptual and quantitative terms) at long- medium- and episodic-time scales. The paper concludes with a discussion of the application of the vulnerability indices and how to use this knowledge on processes for more complete deltaic management.

TI Scope for strategic ecological assessment of trunk-road development in
   England with respect to potential impacts on lowland heathland, the
   Dartford warbler (Sylvia undata) and the sand lizard (Lacerta agilis)
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT

AB Environmental impact assessment (EIA) has a potential role in sustainable development. However; its commonest application has been at the project level, where it fails to ensure adequate consideration of potentially serious trans-boundary, widespread, indirect, cumulative and synergistic ecological effects. The fact that ecological effects cannot be predicted or evaluated effectively if EIA is confined to single development actions and contrained by artificial boundaries is an important justification for moves towards the strategic application of EIA.
   The need for a more strategic approach to ecological assessment can be illustrated by reference to road development in the UK, where project-level EIA has failed to quantify the overall impact of new road development on biodiversity. Some form of strategic ecological assessment (SEcA) is required to ensure that proposed new road development is compatible with international obligations to conserve protected habitats and their associated species. In common with all forms of EIA, the effectiveness of SEcA depends on the ability to define the proposed action or set of actions and to characterize the receiving environment (baseline conditions). The ability to quantify potential impacts and to estimate their risk of occurrence is strongly dependent on the availability, accuracy, reliability and resolution of national data on the distributions of habitats, species and development proposals.
   This paper summarizes the results of a SEcA carried out to determine whether currently proposed road developments, when considered collectively, would be compatible with the safeguard of an internationally important and protected wildlife habitat (lowland heathland) and associated protected species. The study was carried out using a version of the Countryside Information System developed for the UK Department of the Environment by the Institute of Terrestrial Ecology. Areas of lowland heathland are identified together with 'hot spots' where two protected lowland heathland species (sand lizard, Lacerta agilis and the Dartford warbler; Sylvia undata also occur: Possible risks attributable to proposed new road development are quantified for I km squares and evaluated on a county basis.

AB The fermentation characteristics of the novel, thermotolerant, isolate Kloyveromyces marxianus var marxianus were determined to evaluate its aptitude for use in an ethanol production process, Sustainable growth was not observed under anaerobic conditions, even in the presence of unsaturated fatty acid and sterol, A maximum ethanol concentration of 40 g L-1 was produced at 45 degrees C, with an initial specific ethanol production rate of 1.7 g g(-1) h(-1). This was observed at ethanol concentrations below 8 g L-1 and under oxygen-limited conditions, The low ethanol tolerance and low growth under oxygen-limited conditions required for ethanol production implied that a simple continuous process was not feasible with this yeast strain. Improved productivity was achieved through recycling biomass into the fermenter, indicating that utilising an effective cell retention method such as cell recycle or immobilisation, could lead to the development of a viable industrial process using this novel yeast strain.

TI Environmental Values Education: an exploration of its role in the school
   curriculum
SO JOURNAL OF MORAL EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
AB No matter how much our thinking about environmental education has changed over the years, and irrespective of whatever ideological perspectives have held sway, the notion that a consideration of values should have a central part in the process of such an education has been an enduring theme. This paper explores the role of environmental values education within the school curriculum and how it might contribute to the moral development of individual pupils and of society. This paper looks, from a number of perspectives, at what a consideration of environmental values might bring to education, and draws upon recent critiques of established ways in which environmental education tends to be conceptualised. In particular, the paper comments on the assumption that an education for the environment necessarily has to be located within a socially critical framework. Additionally, the paper challenges conventional notions of "balance" and "fairness" when dealing with controversial issues in the classroom, arguing that there are circumstances where it would be imperative for teachers to make explicit the "green theory of value" which they espouse and try to enact. It goes on to set out a range of "sustainability values" which schools might consider promoting. The paper concludes with a call for a research-led IT/INSET model of professional development with values education at its heart as a means of boosting effective environmental education, and of exploring the relationship between education and sustainable living.

ID MATURITY INDEX; SUCCESSION
AB interest in the sustainability of farming practices has increased in response to environmental problems associated with conventional agricultural management often adopted for the production of herbaceous crops, ornamentals, and fruit crops. Availability of measures of the status of the soil ecosystem is of immediate importance, particularly for environmental assessment and monitoring programs. This study investigated the effects of various irrigation regimes (an example of an agricultural management practice) on the structure of the nematode fauna in a citrus orchard in the sandy ridge area of Central Florida. Ecological measures such as community structure indices, diversity indices, and maturity indices were assessed and related to irrigation intensity. Maturity index ir Rs an effective measure in distinguishing differences between irrigation regimes, whereas other indices of community structure were not. Of various nematode genera and trophic groups, only omnivores and the omnivore genera. Aporcelaimellus and Eudorylaimus responded to irrigation treatments.

AB In the southeastern United States, a cotton-peanut rotation is attractive because of the high value and extensive planting of both crops in the region. The objective of this experiment was to determine the effects of cotton-peanut rotations, rye, and soil chemical treatments on management of plant-parasitic nematodes, thrips, and soilborne fungal diseases and on crop yield. Peanut-cotton-rye rotations were conducted from 1988 to 1994 on Tifton loamy sand (Plinthic Kandiudult) infested primarily with Meloidogyne incognita race 3, Belonolaimus longicaudatus, Sclerotium rolfsii, Rhizoctonia solani, and Fusarium oxysporum. Continuous peanut, continuous cotton, cotton-peanut rotation, or peanut-cotton rotation were used as main plots; winter rye or fallow as sub-plots; and cotton with and without aldicarb (3.36 kg a.i./ha), or peanut with and without aldicarb (3.36 kg a.i./ha) plus flutolanil (1.12 kg a.i./ha), as sub-sub-plots. Population densities of M. incognita and B. longicaudatus declined rapidly after the first crop in continuous peanut and remained low thereafter. Neither rye nor soil chemical treat ment affected M. incognita or B. longicaudatus population density on peanut or cotton. Cotton and peanut yields from the cotton-peanut rotation were 26% and 10% greater, respectively, than those from monoculture over the 7-year study. Cotton and peanut yields were improved 9% and 4%, respectively, following rye vs. fallow. Soil chemical treatments increased yields of cotton 23% and peanut 32% over those of untreated plots. Our data demonstrate the sustainable benefits of using cotton-peanut rotations, winter rye, and soil chemical treatments to manage plant-parasitic nematodes and other pests and pathogens and improve yield of both cotton and peanut.

TI Dilemmas of development: Burley tobacco, the environment and economic
   growth in Malawi
SO JOURNAL OF SOUTHERN AFRICAN STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
AB Efforts to encourage smallholder farmers in Malawi to produce tobacco for export illustrate the dilemmas that developing nations and donor organisations face when their quest for development entails compelling economic incentives but potentially harmful impacts on human health and the environment. In addition to the well-known impacts on health associated with the use of tobacco, its production can have deleterious effects on the environment, especially when production (and curing) entails substantial use of wood in a country,facing high levels of deforestation. This article examines the rationale for choosing tobacco as a vehicle for economic development in Malawi and then addresses the difficulties associated with efforts to monitor and mitigate the environmental impacts of sectoral adjustment programmemes. Although advocates of sustainable development routinely argue that development can occur without damage to the environment, achieving this goal is problematic when poverty and malnutrition are widespread, as is the case in Malawi.

AB This paper reviews the process of innovation in the introduction of an electronic auction system for livestock. The growth and development of the system is tracked over a number of years and factors accounting for success and failure are analysed. Previous models of the innovation process provide useful and powerful frameworks for explaining the developments. The growth of 'trust' in the system was found to be an important additional factor in determining successful innovation. Appropriability, defined in terms of the ability of the system's licensor to benefit from the innovation more fully than other stakeholders, is used to determine the Competitive Advantage each of the stakeholders has gained through the innovation. Many of the gains accrued to stakeholders other than the licensor and the long-term changes in the appropriability regime were found to determine the long-run sustainability of the Competitive Advantage. The system was the first of its type in the UK but this did not guarantee success given that a number of second-movers entered the market and were able to develop rival systems. However, early losses were weathered and strategies aimed at widening the scope of activities led to the ultimate success of the system. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the management practice effects on Ming-Hu and Ming-Tan reservoir watersheds during the past 15 years. It is difficult to economically evaluate a watershed project consisting of a number of multisectoral and long term management practices and regulations. However, the reservoirs' hydropower operations and their associated benefits and costs are highlighted in this study. The estimated management practice value (net present value) of 351 million NT (New Taiwan) dollars and a benefit-cost ratio of 1.189 are obtained for the Ming-Hu subwatershed. Because the Ming-Tan hydropower station only began commercial operation in 1992 the estimated management practice value is negative 103 million NT dollars (net present value) and the benefit-cost ratio is 0.653 in the Ming-Tan subwatershed. If the analysis period is contained to the year 2010, the benefit-cost ratio of Ming-Tan reservoir subwatershed becomes 1.103. Ming-Hu and Ming-Tan subwatersheds together share the benefit-cost ratio of 1.182 and the net present value of 1,589 million NT dollars. The results of the analyses indicate that the Taiwan Power Company, the watershed management agency, has implemented economically efficient watershed practices and regulations in Ming-Hu and Ming-Tan reservoir watersheds and the watershed management practices are worthwhile and should be sustained.

DT Article
DE Nigeria; rainfall; resource planning; semi-arid regions; strategies
AB During the last three decades, there has been a steady decline in rainfall within Northern Nigeria where the total annual amount has declined below the 30-year mean; this could be either a permanent or temporary phenomenon. Whatever the trend, the continuous deterioration in climatic conditions, combined with uncoordinated resources planning, are paving the way for a crisis of dramatic proportions in the sub-region. In the rush to combat this threat, like most third-world countries, Nigeria embarked upon large-scale constructions of dams and irrigation-infrastructure facilities without proper planning and coordination. Consequently, the schemes have now failed to achieve their forecast output.
   The paper attempts to establish the important role which the naturally available water-resources potential of the sub-region could play towards sustainable irrigated agricultural development under increasing risks of drought and desertification within the area.

DT Article
AB We have reached the stage of having to implement a global warming prevention action plan for the 21st century. In this article we introduce the global energy scenario announced in the second report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 1995 enhanced by the developments after COP3 in Kyoto 1997, and specify technical development objectives for energy conservation, new energies and environment protection. Futhermore, a general idea of the 'Life Cycle Energy Revenue and Expenditure Balance' is introduced as a sustainable condition for evaluating future energy related technology development. This is shown for various electricity generation cycles. From the viewpoint of a social system giving priority to the environment the construction of an energy cascading and material circulation society becomes increasingly important. Sustainable economic activities are impossible without the 'Reverse Factory', or complete recycling. Decentralization of the electric power generation, and electric power supply network will play an important role in solving environment and energy related problems. The future of individual transportation is outlined. Finally, the importance of technology transfer for internal globalization and international contribution for Japan, emphasizing the need for a technology network without national boundaries is pointed out.

TI Sustaining leprosy services in the changing context of health sector
   reform
SO LEPROSY REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
AB National leprosy control programmes currently face a number of changes to the environment within which they operate. This paper examines the issues arising from these. It focuses, in particular, on those arising from changes in the structure of the health sector as a result of policies of health sector reform which are being considered or adopted in many developing countries. These include decentralization, financing strategies, greater role for the private and NCO sectors and the integration of vertical programmes. The paper is structured around a number of key steps in the development of a strategy for sustainability of appropriate leprosy services. These are the assessment of the epidemiological, social and health services context, development of programme objectives, planning of human and financial resources, development of the strategy, mapping the roles of potential actors, development of regulatory and incentive mechanism, action planning and managing change and, finally, re-evaluation of the programme objectives and service delivery organization. The paper stresses the importance of process in developing ownership of a strategy, it concludes with a set of key questions which it suggests need to be addressed bg leprosy programme managers in the development of a proactive response to the changes.

ID CONTRACTS; LAW; INSTITUTIONS
AB Concepts drawn from the transaction costs literature are used to analyze the governance structure of the transboundary water treaty between the Kingdom of Lesotho and the Republic of South Africa. The analysis shows that the two countries intended a 'relational' governance structure that supports the development of ongoing sustainable relationships at minimum cost. The parties gained economies of scale by using flexible language to resolve controversial issues, establishing various neutral institutions to police the treaty, and integrating benefits under the treaty with existing economic arrangements between them.

DT Article
DE treading; cattle; grazing management; sustainability; hill land
ID GRAZING MANAGEMENT; COUNTRY; FERTILIZER
AB An experiment was conducted on steep hill land in New Zealand to describe the pattern of cattle treading that occurred from a single damage event during winter. The experiment also measured some of the consequences of treading and sought to define the subsequent grazing management which promoted the most rapid recovery of pasture.
   In hill paddocks of mixed topography, damage of the soil surface was greatest on animal tracks/camps and easy contoured areas (<25 degrees) where cattle prefer to walk. Evidence of this initial winter impact disappeared over spring, most rapidly on easy contoured areas and under continuous sheep grazing. To promote rapid recovery of damaged paddocks continued grazing of cattle during spring should be avoided.
   At high levels of damage (>50% soil surface), puddling on tracks/camps and skid damage on steep inter-tracks became frequent. These processes are significant because animal tracks/camps act as important channels for surface water flow in hill lands; and disturbed, inter-track areas are an important source of sediment runoff.
   During spring, pasture growth rates were reduced by treading damage. From a systems context this could represent losses of 5-10 kg DM ha(-1) d(-1) during early-mid spring. Pasture cover and growth rates had fully recovered by early December.

ID DEEP PLACEMENT; APPLICATOR; SOILS
AB The rapid rise in fertilizer prices over the past 2 years coupled with the notoriously low nutrient recovery of fertilizer by lowland rice as managed by farmers of most developing countries has prompted a re-examination of urea briquette agrotechnology that improves fertilizer use efficiency.
   Urea briquettes containing diammonium phosphate (UB-DAP) can be cost effectively produced using a portable fertilizer briquetter on a small scale (200 kg(-1) h(1)) at the village level and at a price affordable by small rice farmers. Their improved management consists of hand placement of properly sized (weight) UB-DAP (N:P = 4:1) per briquette for every four rice hills, and at 7-10 cm soil depth, on the day of or the day after transplanting using modified 20 x 20 cm spacing (25 hills m(-2)). This management is simple to adopt, saves up to 50% of the labor normally required for its conventional hand placement, and helps to reduce the lag period of spatial nonavailability of DAP-P to the rice plants. Results of several farmer-managed field trials conducted during the 1990-95 wet seasons in India demonstrate that the UB-DAP management makes the fertilizer agronomically more efficient, economically more attractive with less risk, and reduced losses of nutrients as compared with conventional use of prilled urea and single superphosphate. The fertilizer use offers women farmers a unique opportunity to play an important role in increasing rice productivity. The management of UB-DAP can be integrated with plant nutrient recycling and limited Glircidia green manuring (an agroforestry approach). This integrated use of UB-DAP has the potential to increase rice production of small resource-poor rice farmers with less fertilizer and in sustainable manner in rainfed as well as irrigated transplanted rice ecoregions of developing countries, while protecting the environment. Therefore, the UB-DAP fertilizer can be an important NP source for transplanted rice in the 21(st) century.

AB Management of soil phosphate fertility in sustainable agriculture depends on transformations of applied fertilizers as an input to correct soil defficiencies. This research investigated the changes of P pools of different extractability with fertilization in an incubation experiment. Sequential fractionation was used in 5 native argentine soils: Entisol, Andisol, Vertisol, Mollisol and Ultisol, with 0 and 45 kg P ha(-1) added as KH2PO4 and incubated for 90 days. In our experimental conditions, labile inorganic P (LIP) content of control soils increased for Entisol and Mollisol (75% and 35% respectively), while moderately resistant inorganic fractions (MRIP) were greater in Andisol (95%) and Ultisol (39%) following incubation. This increase was related to a decrease in labile organic fractions (LOP) in Andisol (-73%), Mollisol (-36%) and Ultisol (-36%). Moderately resistant organic forms (MROP) were significatively lower for all soils except Mollisol.
   As a consequence of P fertilization, LIP increased for Entisol (146%), Vertisol (23%) and Mollisol (39%), and MRIP showed the same tendence in Ultisol (57%) and Andisol (97%). LOP was signifcatively lower for all soils, except Andisol. MROP decreased in all soils except Mollisol, with the greatest variation in Andisol (-56%). In this experiment, labile P, the agronomically important pool, showed a similar pathway for native and fertilizer P for each taxonomic Order, with a significative increase in Mollisol and Entisol. P for each taxonomic Order, with a significative increase in Mollisol and Entisol.
   The main reservoir for fertilizer P was IF, mainly LIP in Mollisol and Entisol, and MRIP in Vertisol, Andisol and Ultisol.
   Organic P tended to decrease with incubation, and the highest values of organic fractions were found in younger soils (Entisol and Andisol), followed by Ultisol. Residual effect of fertilizer could be higher in Andisol and Ultisol due to transformation into non-labile forms.

AB One of the major objectives of on-farm research is to test and refine recommendations coming from controlled research conditions to suit the variable conditions met under farmer circumstances. In developing countries, resources available for agricultural research are limiting. Therefore the challenge is to develop methodologies favouring resource-use efficiency and facilitating relatively fast results. At the same time researchers must take advantage of a high level of farmer participation and sample environmental variables suspected of affecting the technology's performance. In this context, ways in which to deal with variability, both in terms of environment as well as in farmer management, become important. To present lessons learned, this case study describes first relevant aspects of the farming system, a brief history of the problem and the resulting experimental program. For illustration purposes, one year of data is presented in detail. This came from a farmer-implemented, farmer-managed test on urea use (30 kg/ha nitrogen) in rice cultivation based on water harvesting.
   Variation in rice yields has been investigated in order to determine whether known differences in cultivation circumstances (water level during fertilizer application, field position on the slope, rice variety used) warrant refining the recommendation regarding urea use. It is known for example that water height varying at application time can significantly influence the rice crop's response to nitrogen; however, in this investigation urea use proved to be an economically attractive option over the water level range investigated (5-15 cm).
   Although variable response to urea use due to environmental factors was identified, economic evaluation using Marginal Rates of Return showed that under all conditions urea use was justified. Therefore, the recommendation does not need to be refined, given the assumptions presented.
   Finally, the sustainability of urea use is discussed, in view of the fact that nitrogen application enhances crop yields and therefore increases the extraction of other crucial plant nutrients.

TI Improving forage crops for semi-arid areas

ID DROUGHT
AB In semi-arid areas, forage crops for grazing are suitable for extensive, marginal lands because they can sustain competitive meat or milk production, they protect against soil erosion risks, and they can form the basis of an alternative sustainable agriculture. Drought is the main limiting factor to plant growth in these lands, seriously affecting total herbage production and seasonal availability of forage. Recent research work looking for new cultivars of some annual self-reseeding pasture crops (annual rye grass, lupin and subterranean clover) with an enhanced capacity for herbage or seed production under water stress, has demonstrated the difficulties in obtaining new cultivars of well adapted crops with substantial yield improvement under drought conditions. New management strategies for improving pasture availability for grazing and self-reseeding ability have been tested (also at farm level) showing clear possibilities for enhancement of herbage production and a more regular seasonal distribution in drought-prone environments.

AB The success of sustainable agroecosystems is closely linked to the availability of high quality information. This sort of information will optimize management and decision making, improving profits and lowering the agrochemicals impact in the agroecosystems. This is the aim of SITRAMA (Interactive System for Weed Management), a system that deals with the weed management within soybean crop context, using knowledge engineering techniques. SITRAMA comprises four modules. The first one deals with weed recognition at seedling stage; the second is concerned with the different control and management strategies which take into account the crop system variables, the third deals with crop losses taken into account weed density & distribution; and the fourth is concerned with economic analysis under conventional techniques (revenues/costs) or novel ones (margin maximisation, risks & uncertainty). The goal of this paper is to present the developement of the first module, - weed recognition -, stressing the strategies followed to achieve the identification goal. The strategies used simplify the conventional dicotomic classification, focusing into relevant characters of the seedling. In such a way, information required to the user is minimized, emulating an expert reasoning.

AB Most citrus nurseries and orchards in Florida are infested with Phytophthora nicotianae, the causal agent of Phytophthora root rot. Although fungicides control the disease and increase seedling growth and tree yields, they are not always economically or environmentally sustainable. Amendment of citrus soils with composted municipal waste (CMW) may provide an alternative to fungicides for disease management. Citrus seedling growth decreased with increasing proportions of one CMW source, indicating the potential for phytotoxicity from soluble salts and acetic acid when the proportion of CMW in soil exceeded 20% (vol/vol). When a citrus soil was amended (20% vol/vol) with certain sources of CMW, the incidence of infection of 5-week-old susceptible citrus seedlings by P. nicotianae was reduced from 95% to as low as 5%. Addition of fresh CMW to two different citrus soils reduced colony growth of P. nicotianae after the fungus was incubated in the amended soil for 6 days and then recovered on PARPH selective medium. If CMW was stored for more than 3 months before amendment, the soil mixtures did not suppress colony development. In general, extracts of fresh CMW reduced mycelial growth in vitro; whereas suppressiveness of CMW from the same batch was lost after storage. Acetic acid was detected at higher concentration in fresh CMW that suppressed colony growth than in CMW that lacked activity. A species of Acremonium was isolated from another source of CMW that was suppressive to P. nicotianae. This fungus parasitized hyphae of P. nicotianae in vitro. Thus, CMWs have the potential to at least temporarily suppress P. nicotianae through chemical and microbial agents depending on source and age of the CMW.

TI Agency reform as decision process: The reengineering of the agency for
   international development
SO POLICY SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
AB The Agency for International Development (AID), the U.S. Government's principal dispenser of foreign economic assistance, is struggling to define its mission in the post Cold War era. AID staff and overseas presence has contracted in recent years following 'reinvention' reforms. But reinvention has not clarified the agency's mission nor protected it from powerful critics..AID's future depends on its ability to develop a mission that excites popular demand. Agency reformers promote foreign aid as a means to advance sustainable development in developing countries. But AID's sustainable development mission lacks credibility because it excludes references to reforms required in post-industrial societies. Participation of U.S. local interests in aid management and more effective promotion of familiar premises for aid (many of them consistent with the tenets of sustainable development) are essential elements of a revitalized foreign aid program.

DE Canada; minerals and metal policy; sustainable development
AB Among the challenges facing the minerals and metals industry is that posed by sustainable development. Canada's new minerals and metals policy seeks to promote a prosperous and competitive minerals and metals industry that operates on a sustainable basis. The policy demonstrates how the concept applies to minerals and metals. Until recently, these non-renewable resources have often been overlooked when sustainable development is discussed in the context of natural resources. The policy addresses issues such as the implementation of a sustainable approach to decision-making, regulatory reform, non-regulatory initiatives by industry, and the development of criteria and indicators of sustainability with respect to minerals and metals.

TI Ecological and cultural landscape restoration and the cultural evolution
   towards a post-industrial symbiosis between human society and nature
SO RESTORATION ECOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB I discuss ecological and cultural restoration within the broader context of the critical transition period from the fossil fuel age to the post-industrial global information age. In this cultural evolutionary process, the restoration of natural and cultural landscapes should play a vital role. For this purpose, it has to be guided by a holistic and transdisciplinary systems approach, aiming ndt only at the organismic but also at the functional and structural restoration of ecological and cultural diversity as total landscape ecodiversity. For the development of suitable restoration strategies, a clear distinction has to be made between different functional classes of natural and cultural solar-powered biosphere and fossil-powered technosphere landscapes, according to their inputs and throughputs of energy and materials, their organisms, their control by natural or human information, their internal self-organization and their regenerative capacities. Not only technosphere landscapes but also intensive agroindustrial landscapes have lost these capacities and are heavily subsidized by fossil energy and chemicals, to the detriment of the environment and human health. They therefore have to be rehabilitated by more sustainable but not less productive agricultural systems based on organic farming. But their natural regenerative capacities can be restored only by regenerative systems, with the help of cultural "neotechnic" information. The promise for an urgently required evolutionary symbiosis between human society and nature in a sustainable post-industrial total human ecosystem lies in the functional integration of such innovative regenerative systems and all natural and cultural biosphere landscapes with healthier and more livable technosphere landscapes. To this goal, ecological and cultural landscape restoration can make an important contribution.

AB This article presents a theory of outside equity based on the control rights and the maturity design of equity. I show that outside equity is a tacit agreement between investors and management supported by the equity-bolders' right to dismiss management regardless of performance and by the lack of a prespecified expiration date on equity. As a tacit agreement outside equity is sustainable despite management's potential for manipulating the cash flows and regardless of how costly it is for equityholders to establish a case against managerial wrongdoing. I establish that the only outside equity that investors are willing to hold in equilibrium is that with unlimited life, the very outside equity that corporations issue. Consistent with empirical evidence, this model predicts that debt-equity ratios are higher (lower) in industries with low thigh) cash flow variability.

AB Georgescu-Roegen's work is usually divided into two categories, his earlier work on consumer and production theory and his later concern with entropy and bioeconomics beginning with his 1966 introductory essay to his collected theoretical papers published in the volume Analytical Economics. Most economists usually praise his earlier work on pure theory and ignore his later work which is highly critical of neoclassical economics. Those economists sympathetic to his later work usually take the position that he "saw the light" and gave up neoclassical theory some time in the 1960s to turn his attention to the issues of resource scarcity and social institutions. It is argued here that there is an unbroken path running from Georgescu's work in pure theory in the 1930s, 1930s, and 1950s, through his writings on peasant economies in the 1960s, lending to his preoccupation with entropy and bioeconomics in the last 25 years of his life. That common thread is his preoccupation with "valuation." The choices our species makes about resource use and the distribution of economic output depends upon our valuation framework. Georgescu-Roegen's work begins in the 1930s with a critical examination of the difficulties with the hedonistic valuation framework of neoclassical economics, moves in the 1960s to the conflict between social and hedonistic valuation, and culminates in the 1970s and 1980s with his examination of the conflict between individual, social, and environmental values. This paper traces the evolution of Georgescu-Roegen's thought about valuation and the environmental and social policy recommendations which arise out of his bioeconomic framework.

TI Environmental considerations in physical planning under different
   conditions: A comparison of a Polish and a Norwegian municipality
SO SCANDINAVIAN HOUSING & PLANNING RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID URBAN
AB An investigation of the environmental content in land use planning in the Norwegian municipality of Sandefjord and the Polish municipality of Myslenice shows a surprisingly high degree of similarity. In both cases, the protection of farmland and scarce biotopes as well as sewage management has been emphasised in the plans. Cultural heritage and cultural landscapes have been a strong concern in Myslenice, while Sandefjord has paid more attention to natural areas for outdoor recreation. In both cases there has been little focus on energy conservation, and the concept of sustainable development has hardly been discussed. The content of the plans has been considerably influenced by national environmental policies. The type of political system (capitalism vs, state socialism) has indirectly influenced the amount of construction and hence the pace of conversion of undeveloped land, but does not appear to have had much influence on the environmental content of the plans apart from this. The emphasis laid on various environmental issues in part reflects the actual local challenges, but also cross-national cultural differences and the fact that the environmental agenda has been widened in both municipalities during the period, most pronounced in Sandefjord. Professional ideals, knowledge and methods common among planners across national boundaries seem to have influenced the content of the plans considerably.

AB The literature suggests that the establishment of seed yield potential in cool-season perennial grasses is based on developmental processes that take place before floral induction. The relationship between vegetative plant development to flowering and seed yield can be influenced by numerous factors, such as genotype, stand age, post-harvest regrowth environment, pests, manage ment practices and juvenility. The objectives of our investigations and survey of literature were to identify characteristics of vegetative plant development present before floral induction (autumn regrowth period) that were related to flowering (yield potential) and seed yield (utilization of seed yield potential). The number of fertile tillers present at anthesis is a function of the number and developmental state (or biological age) of vegetative tillers present prior to floral induction. The number and size of vegetative tillers before induction was correlated with flowering and seed yield in young stands of orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata L.) and tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) (r = 0.93 and 0.95 for first-year stands of orchardgrass and tall fescue, respectively), but older stands did not exhibit this relationship. The basal diameter of vegetative tillers in autumn was related to flowering and seed yield in young stands of Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.) and creeping red fescue (F. rubra L.). As stands aged, basal diameter was not a primary indicator of subsequent flowering and seed yield. Tiller height at the end of the regrowth period was consistently related to flowering and seed yield in Kentucky bluegrass (r = -0.81, P < 0.01) and creeping red fescue (r = -0.87, P<0.01), regardless of stand age. Increasing the rhizome:root ratio caused reduction of flowering in creeping red fescue. Vegetative characteristics were not related to flowering and seed production in perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) and dryland bentgrass (Agrostis castellana Boiss. and Reut.). Green leaf number was a poor indicator of flowering and seed yield potential in all species tested. Ethylene production during autumn vegetative development has been implicated as a potential cause of reduced flowering in creeping red fescue. As much as 92% of the seed yield potential in several cool-season perennial grasses is set before the onset of conditions favouring vernalization of the crop. An increased understanding of developmental gateways in the formation of flowering and seed yield potential may be key to enhancing the economic and environmental sustainability of seed production enterprises.

AB Objectives: (i) To compare acquisition costs of drugs between countries to treat one standardised STD episode. (ii) To explain variations, treatment protocols, purchasing policies, procurement systems, and sources of financing.
   Methods: National STD guidelines, purchasing mechanisms, and drug acquisition costs from 15 countries were compiled, using information from ministries of health and European Commissions headquarters. Prices were converted in European currency unit (ecu). Acquisition costs per episode were calculated for the four main STD syndromes-urethral discharge, vaginal discharge, lower abdominal pain in women, and genital ulcer disease (GUD). To compare costs in different countries the relative distribution of the four main STD syndromes was calculated.
   Results: Treatment protocols. All 15 countries recommended treatment for urethral discharge with drugs effective against Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis. For vaginal discharge two patterns emerged. In 11 countries women with vaginal discharge were divided into high risk of STDs and low risk of STDs. Women at low risk were treated for candidiasis, trichomoniasis, and bacterial vaginosis and those at high risk were also treated for N gonorrhoeae and C trachomatis. Guidelines for abdominal pain all included treatment for N gonorrhoeae, C trachomatis, and anaerobic infections. All countries except the Philippines recommended treating GUD with drugs effective against chancroid and syphilis. Costs per episode. Acquisition costs per episode varied from 0.40 ecu to 7.89 ecu with wide variations. The standardised acquisition cost of STD drugs for the public sector varied between 0.54 ecu in Tanzania and 5.80 ecu in Swaziland. The choice of drugs was the main factor explaining this difference. In countries which only use generic drugs, acquisition costs were lower (between 0.54 ecu and 1.07 ecu). However, important variations exist between countries which use similar treatment protocols (for example, 2.54 ecu in Namibia, 5.80 ecu in Swaziland). These variations are mainly explained by differences in procurement methods. Acquisition costs for peripheral public sec-vices are higher than at central level (for example, 0.89 ecu versus 0.54 ecu in Tanzania) as a result of mark ups for transport, handling, and inflation. Acquisition cost of drugs per standardised STD episode for patients through private pharmacies may be as high as 11.93 ecu in Senegal. This is more than 10 times the acquisition cost for public sector at central level in this country (of 1.04 ecu) and is mainly due to the fact that drugs in private pharmacies are branded drugs, which are imported at a high price, taxes, and mark ups in the distribution chain. In 11 of the 15 countries studied, effective STD drugs are now available through public services, in at least in a part of the country. In Botswana, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Mauritania, Lesotho, Namibia, Senegal, Seychelles, and Swaziland these drugs are supplied throughout the country within the existing essential drug programme and financed by the government budget or through a revolving fund for drugs. In Tanzania and Mozambique, all STD drugs in the public sector are funded through donor support. In Nepal recommended STD drugs are widely available at low cost through private outlets.
   Conclusions: Reducing antimicrobial susceptibility of N gonorrhoeae and Haemophilus ducreyi is a continuous threat for sustainable STD drug supply as alternative patented drugs are more expensive. If patented STD drugs are required drug cost may be minimised by selecting the most appropriate management protocols and by improving procurement. Moreover, recent studies have confirmed the continued susceptibility of N gonorrhoeae to low cost generic drugs in some countries (Mozambique, Tanzania, and Senegal). Even under these circumstances, continued donor support will be needed for the poorest countries to ensure the availability of effective STD management as an essential and cost effective component of basic health services.

TI Issues in the conservation and management of forests in Laos: The case
   of Sangthong District
SO SINGAPORE JOURNAL OF TROPICAL GEOGRAPHY
LA English
DT Article
ID DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; NATURAL-RESOURCES
AB Amidst the increasing concern about steadily depleting forests in Laos, this paper examines its causes and existing forest management systems in Sangthong District. Forests in Sangthong were virtually undisturbed until the early 1970s. Guided by customary law, a relatively small local population utilised the forest sustainably for food, fodder, wood fuel and construction materials. Subsequently the government effectively abolished customary law through the declaration of forests as state property and the sanctioning of logging. Logging was banned in the early 1990s but forest degradation continues as a result of ongoing logging, the open access to forests, the government policy of utilising degraded forests for agriculture, and population pressure from in-migration. Village surveys show that local people appreciate ecological and economic values of forest resources and are willing to contribute to their management. These social qualities lay the foundation of a sustainable forest management system, but the evolution of this type of system has been prevented by the "open access" to forest resources. For effective forest conservation a management strategy focused on property rights reform, public participation and integrated rural development is proposed.

TI Natural change in the environment: A challenge to the
   pressure-state-response concept
SO SOCIAL INDICATORS RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB The pressure-state-response framework is a powerful approach to environmental assessment. In many of its current expressions, however, it ignores the background natural processes that play a major role in determining environmental and ecosystem health. Clearly, policies must be focused on human actions that scar the landscape and harm the environment, but coping with environmental change also requires an assessment of the natural processes that take place whether or not human influences are at work. A newly-developed class of environmental indicators (geoindicators), presented here in brief, may be helpful in understanding the interaction of human and natural processes and impacts. Explicit recognition of the need to include natural conditions in the indicator system is essential in the transition from environmental reporting to sustainability reporting.

AB Dramatic economic growth and policy reform in China have resulted in great changes in resource use patterns. Pastoral areas in the north and northwest are among the areas affected by these changes, with grassland degradation identified as a major and increasing problem. me report here on a study undertaken in Xilingol Biosphere Reserve, Inner Mongolia (focused on Baiinxile Fan) where socioeconomic factors, including property rights reforms and open access to grazing land have combined to promote unsustainable exploitation of the grassland resource by local herders. The study shows that, although biosphere reserves aim to establish sustainable development at a landscape scale, the current property rights regime in Baiinxile Fan associated with social change is driving local resource users toward greater degradation of the grasslands. The opportunity exists to build on existing village-level institutions to develop a participatory communal resource management system to help protect the grassland's biodiversity and productivity.

AB The contribution non-point P sources make to the total P loading on water bodies in agricultural catchments has not been fully appreciated. Using data derived from plot scale experimental studies, and modelling approaches developed to simulate system behaviour under differing management scenarios, a fuller understanding of the processes controlling P export and transformations along non-paint transport pathways can be achieved. One modelling approach which has been successfully applied to large UK catchments (50-350 km(2) in area) is applied here to a small, 1.5 km(2) experimental catchment. The importance of scaling is discussed in the context of how such approaches can extrapolate the results from plot-scale experimental studies to full catchment scale. However, the scope of such models is limited, since they do not at pre:lent directly simulate the processes controlling P transport and transformation dynamics. its such, they can only simulate total P export on an annual basis, and are not capable of prediction over shorter time scales. The need for development of process-based models to help answer these questions, and for more comprehensive UK experimental studies is highlighted as a pre-requisite for the development of suitable and sustainable management strategies to reduce nonpoint P loading on water bodies in agricultural catchments.

AB This paper illustrates how experimentation with a system dynamics model may be used to determine the terms of trade for meeting long-term contentions for sustaining global economic relations and environment, It has two :parts, a review of empirical evidence that describes the trends in the volume and the nature of international trade over the past decade, and an exploratory analysis of their implications for the emergent contentions for global development and environment. The first part draws on secondary data and literature. The second part attempts to reinterpret in the global context an existing model the author developed originally to understand valuation and income distribution processes in a dualist economic system within a developing country. The exploratory nature of the second part should be accented since the model it draws on was developed for a different purpose and the analysis of his paper only addresses its relevance to the global context without modifying any component of the model structure; hence it has some limitations. The original model focused, however, on the determinants of value accrued to the parties contributing to the production process, which is relevant both to income distribution within a country and the transfer of value and environmental costs through trade between countries, The experimental process adopted in the paper is seen to be of value for designing global agreements committing concerned parties to complex roles.

AB Violent conflict is increasingly viewed as a factor related to sustainable development. This article argues, based on the well-established theory of lateral pressure originally proposed by Choucri and North in 1975, that the relationship arises because the same factors that affect sustainable development also influence conflict, namely population, technology, resources, military force, and trade and bargaining, while conflict, in turn, affects these variables. The theory is tested with a system dynamics model that includes international as well as domestic violent conflict, calibrated to seven countries in southern Africa and six OECD countries, The results show a number of situations in which conflict is perpetuated in a cycle that is difficult to break.

AB The literature of resource-based development has widely discussed the impacts of oil revenues on the economic structure of oil-exporting countries. However, in addition to economic structure, oil revenues have a substantial impact on the growth and sustainability of the public sector in oil-exporting countries, which has not been discussed. This paper develops a system dynamics model to analyze the dynamics of government financial structure and public services in the course of development based on oil revenues, In oil-exporting countries, governments use their oil revenues to finance development projects and pay for a major part of operating and maintenance cost of public services. Development budget accumulates new capacity for public services and infrastructure. As public services capacity increases so does the required recurrent budget to pay for the operating and maintenance cost. The governments would need more oil revenues to sustain the growth of public sector and to pay for the growing recurrent budget. However, oil revenues cannot grow for ever. Limitation from market demand or oil reserves would restrict continuous growth of oil revenues. Oil revenues stop growing and eventually will fall. Decline of oil revenues would create a financial crisis for the public sector of oil-exporting countries. The development budget will fall below depreciation and public-sector capacity will drop. The paper also considers investment in public enterprises as another use of oil revenues, Since these enterprises do not usually produce a return, such investment will not impact the collapse of the public sector. The paper concludes with some policy recommendations for increasing the chance of sustainability of the public sector in oil-exporting countries. (C) 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB The unsustainability of the present trajectories of technical change in sectors such as transport and agriculture is widely recognized. It is far from clear; however, how a transition to mon sustainable modes of development may be achieved Sustainable technologies that fulfil important user requirements in terms of performance and price are most often not available on the market. Ideas of what might be more sustainable technologies exist; but the long development times, uncertainty about market demand and social gains, and the need for change at different levels-in organization, technology infrastructure and the wider social and institutional context-provide a great barrier. This raises the question of how the potential of more sustainable technologies and modes of development may be exploited. In this article we describe how technical change is locked into dominant technological regimes, and present a perspective, called strategic niche management, on how to expedite a transition into a new regime. The perspective consists of the creation and/or management of niches for promising technologies.

AB Recent years have witnessed an upsurge of interest in the concept of sustainable tourism. For the most part, attention has focused on defining the concept. Authors have reasoned that in order to achieve sustainable tourism, a sound understanding must first be gained of what the concept means. This article does not take issue with this general approach, but nevertheless argues that the time has now come to move on from defining sustainable tourism, to begin to consider how it may best be implemented in practice. An approach based on the methodology of environmental economics is suggested as a possible way forward, (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd, All rights reserved.

SO TOURISM MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE sustainable tourism; local government attitudes
AB Based on a survey of local government tourism officers in the UK, this article examines the attitudes of public sector 'tourism managers' towards the principles of 'sustainable tourism'. It has been argued that the attitudes of local officers will affect their approach to implementation, and intel alia to the success of this concept in practice. In particular, the article looks at the possibility of the greater integration of tourism in strategic land-use planning and community involvement, as it is these areas of activity which tend to diverge from the more traditional forms of 'tourism planning' in destinations as practised in the past. The results suggest broad support for the greater co-ordination and integration of tourism planning at the local level, however, not all were as keen to embrace the community beyond the rather 'passive' role of public relations and participation in the local development plan system.

TI Waste management agenda setting: a case of incorrect problem definition?
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT & RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
DE solid waste; hazardous waste; capacity assurance planning; USA
ID POLICY
AB This paper uses Rochefort and Cobb's anatomy of problem and Kingdon's agenda building model to explain how capacity issues involving hazardous and solid wastes found their way onto the agendas of the United States Congress and the State of Tennessee General Assembly Through this case study several conclusions are offered about agenda building, problem definition, capacity assurance planning and the implications of environmental problems reaching agenda status through political avenues. First, although scientific or technical assertions are often necessary for an environmental issue to reach policy agenda status, neither applies in this case. Instead, political issues (e.g. the perceived failure to site management facilities) prevailed. Second, the outcome of the solution (capacity assurance planning) crystallized problems that were not perceived as problems but might have proven to be and raised the question of incorrect problem identification. Third, capacity assurance planning is a useful analytical tool but should also be viewed as a valid planning exercise. Finally, sustainability and commitment to solving environmental problems even though they may arise through political avenues are crucial.

AB The objective of this paper is to assess the economic and environmental performance of municipal multi-material waste collection and sorting programmes, and their contribution to sustainable development. These programmes collect and sort household waste in order to recover materials that are considered to be desirable "outputs" of the process. However, recovery procedures also generate "undesirable outputs" such as pollution, noise and residues. To account for different aspects in a performance measure, the concept of "productive efficiency" is used. The feasibility of a non-parametric approach to productive efficiency is illustrated and substantiated, including economic and environmental variables in assessing the performances of nine waste collection and sorting programmes from European municipalities.

TI A Global Outlook for Water Resources to the Year 2025
SO WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE global; water resources; water resource-based vulnerability; water
   supply and use
AB With growing concerns for sustainable development world over, planners of natural resources are focussing their attention on vulnerability arising from availability and use of water resources. Past studies of water resource vulnerability have either been too aggregate, or have focussed on one single dimension of these issues. This study presents a comprehensive analysis of global (using national scope) water resource-based vulnerability (WRV) using a joint criteria of water availability and its relative use. Vulnerability status for each country was assessed for the present (1990) situation, as well as for the year 2025. Four factors were taken into account to determine the nature of the WRV for a country: population growth, food self-sufficiency, industrial development, and climate change. World population growth, which is projected to increase to 8.45 billion people by the year 2025, by itself would trigger 40% of the population residing in countries facing some degree of WRV. Combined with food self-sufficiency, industrial growth, and climate change, by the year 2025, some 5.1 billion (60% of the total world population) would live in regions potentially experiencing moderate to extreme WRV. The study suggests that the regions that are at great risk are those already facing some degree of WRV; the climate change would most likely accentuate the already worsening situation in many regions, while improve it in regions that are not projected to be vulnerable.

ID URBAN AIR-QUALITY; HEDONIC PRICES; BENEFITS; VALUES
AB Government agencies and water managers have showed an increasing interest for tradeable water entitlements (TWE) as a tool to alleviate the influence of raising water prices and to facilitate a reallocation of water resources to more efficient and sustainable uses from economic, social, and environmental perspectives. hn understanding of how the water market works and which factors determine water right prices has become important to establish whether TWE policies facilitate this process. This research shows that the objectives largely have been achieved and that the more efficient irrigators are willing to pay a higher price for water, whereas the least efficient farmers are willing to sell at a lower price, showing that the buyers with high value of marginal product are willing to pay a price in excess of the value of the income generated by the sellers with low value of marginal product. Within the present legislative framework TWE does not, however, always direct water to the most sustainable users in an equitable manner.

AB The social discourse on the topics environmental protection or sustainable utilization of resources is given dynamism by the introduction of opinions and symbols into the discussion. Politics of information are therefore characterized just by the repetition of statements for the creation or modification of a dominating opinion. Therefore this opinion results to a minor part from direct perception of reality but through indirect perception of most different communication channels. This process of opinion-forming and the effects of social attitudes are major research topics at the Chair of forest Policy and Forest History of the LMU - Munich.
   Very often the existing unbalances between an increasing utilization of waste paper on the one hand and she decreasing consumption of industrial wood from thinnings on the other hand is cited in connection with the discussions on a sustainable paper cycle. Looking at this phenomenon from a social science point of view, it's becoming evident that the attitude of society is preventing from a more favorable solution for both sides. In the follow rip this opinion-trap is described with the help of two phenomena and the consequences for the paper industry and forestry is explained.
   The following presentation defines in the beginning the item "sustainability", discusses the problems of the implementation of a sustainable paper cycle. To succeed the positions of the involved actors (forestry, paper industry, environmental groups and agencies) should be considered in a sufficient way to avoid that conflicts are transported neither spatial, temporal nor within the dimensions of sustainability (ecology, production, technic, society).

AB Using a conceptual model consisting of three intersecting spheres of concern (environmental protection, human needs provision, and economic welfare) central to most environmental issues, we map six major Christian traditions of thought. Our purpose is to highlight the complementarities among these diverse responses in order to inform a more holistic Christian environmentalism founded on one or more of the major tenets of each of the six core traditions. Our approach also incorporates major premises of at least the more moderate versions of biocentrism, ecocentrism, and anthropocentrism. We label this holistic approach "cosmocentrism" and use it as the basis for a preliminary description of the notion of "pluralistic stewardship." We argue that only such holistic environmental perspectives, where societal needs are more directly coupled with environmental protection, and a pluralism of worldviews are acknowledged as potentially contributing to such efforts are capable of successfully addressing the complex issues we face today. We note that, at the international level in particular, Christian thought and secular environmentalism already have been moving in such a direction.

ID CORN-SOYBEAN ROTATION; SOIL-EROSION
AB The North Appalachian Experimental Watershed near Coshocton, OH was established in 1935 to develop, evaluate, and refine conservation practices that reduce runoff and erosion under the hilly, humid conditions of the northeastern United States. Small (0.5 to 1 ha), single-practice, gaged watersheds comprised of sandstone- and shale-derived residual soils are used to evaluate the interaction of management, climate, and soils. In a 28-year, nine-watershed study, 92% of the erosion occurred during the corn (Zea mays L.) years of a 4-year corn/wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)/meadow/meadow rotation. These watersheds were moldboard plowed prior to planting corn and cultivation was used for weed control. By tilling and planting on the contour and increasing fertility levels, soil loss was reduced more than 3-fold, but still averaged 4.7 Mg ha(-1) during corn years. Thus, annual production of row crops on a sustainable basis was not without risk. A 6-year, six-watershed study indicated that by using reduced tillage (no-till, chisel, or paraplow) and herbicides, corn and soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] can be grown in rotation with an average soil loss of 0.5 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1), well below the stipulated soil loss tolerance of 7.8 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1), if a winter cover crop of rye (Secale cereale L.) followed soybean. Under these conditions, however, concentrations of surface-applied herbicides and nitrate in runoff frequently exceeded drinking water standards, particularly in the first few runoff events after application, and may be a concern. A reduced-input management practice for corn and soybean production with light disking and cultivation for weed control and manure and a legume (red clover, Trifolium pratense L.) to supply some of the nitrogen was implemented to determine if a balance between losses of soil and purchased chemical inputs could be obtained. In a B-year comparison, soil losses were similar to those under conservation tillage, but the risk of yield loss increased due to inability to cultivate in a timely manner due to weather conditions. Regardless of tillage practice, infrequent, severe storms during years when row crops were grown caused most of the soil loss from the watersheds. Erosion prediction models must account for the contribution of such events and management practices must limit erosion caused by these storms if long-term sustainability is to be maintained.

AB Despite an important small scale bivalve fishery in Peru, hardly any management plans are applied to exploit the resource. Furthermore, little of the ecological data necessary to develop management strategies have been published so far. The present paper deals with the fishery of the most important infaunal bivalve of Peru, Gari solida, from Bahia Independencia where the largest Peruvian population is located. Growth parameters of the von Bertalanffy growth function were L-infinity = 101.6 mm and k = 0.495. total mortality was Z = 1.64 [yr(-1)], fishing mortality F = 1.31 [yr(-1)] and mean natural mortality (M) over bar = 0.38 [yr(-1)]. Total biomass, calculated by direct sampling surveys was 627 t ash-free dry weight (AFDW) in August 1990, 435 t AFDW in February 1991;md 137 t AFDW in October 1991. The observed exploitation rate, calculated from Z and F was E = 0.80, whereas exploitation rate corresponding to the maximum yield (calculated by Beverton and Holt yield per recruit model) was E-max = 0.65. Therefore, it is assumed that the biomass reduction (corresponding to a total decline of 78%) was caused by fishing activities. Other sources reveal a decline of 92% from 1990 to 1994. It is necessary to establish and apply management plans for a sustainable exploitation of this resource. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Maps of forest types in southern Sweden covering the last 2000 years reveal a rapid and widespread transformation from rich, mixed deciduous forest types to species-poor coniferous-dominated forest types. The maps are presented at 500-year intervals and are based on syntheses of fossil pollen data. Fagus sylvatica replaced deciduous mixtures in southerly regions, and during the last 500 years Picea abies became a widespread dominant. We interpret this transformation as being partially a consequence of the climate-driven, continental-scale migrations of Fagus and Picea, but the major controlling factor appears to have been former land-use. This conclusion has significant consequences for 'nature-based' silviculture and conservation of biodiversity. Many threatened species are associated with deciduous forest mixtures, and these forest types have experienced recent. rapid decline. We state that a biologically sustainable silviculture in southern Sweden should be based on a larger range of tree species than at present, thus mimicking natural conditions and providing a greater diversity of product and biological value for the future.

AB Recent experiments have provided some evidence that loss of biodiversity may impair the functioning and sustainability of ecosystems. However, we still lack adequate theories and models to provide robust generalizations, predictions, and interpretations for such results. Here I present a mechanistic model of a spatially structured ecosystem in which plants compete for a limiting soil nutrient, This model shows that plant species richness does not necessarily enhance ecosystem processes, but it identifies two types of factors that could generate such an effect: (i) complementarity among species in the space they occupy below ground and (ii) positive correlation between mean resource-use intensity and diversity. In both cases, the model predicts that plant biomass, primary productivity. and nutrient retention all increase with diversity, similar to results reported in recent field experiments. These two factors, however, have different implications for the understanding of the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, The model also shows that the effect of species richness on productivity or other ecosystem processes is masked by the effects of physical environmental parameters on these processes. Therefore, comparisons among sites cannot reveal it, unless abiotic conditions are very tightly; controlled. Identifying and separating out the mechanisms behind ecosystem responses to biodiversity should become the focus of future experiments.

AB Stubble mulch tillage (SMT) and no-tillage (NT) are well adapted for dryland crops in the US Great Plains. Long-term use of NT, however, may impair soil physical conditions and crop yields, and, by inference, soil quality and production sustainability. We determined effects of using SMT and NT in several cropping systems for dryland winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and grain sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) production on soil bulk density (BD), penetration resistance (PR), and water content (WC). We determined these in 1994 in plots of a tillage method and cropping system study started in 1982 on Pullman (Torrertic Paleustoll) clay loam at Bushland, TX, USA. Due to the nature of the study, a common statistical analysis of the data was not appropriate, but eight separate analyses were possible. Besides tillage method and cropping system, these allowed comparisons due to rotation phase, land condition (level or non-level), and crop grown. Soil ED and PR always increased with depth and WC often increased. The tillage x depth interaction effect also was significant. Soil ED and PR were lower in the tillage layer (0-10 cm depth) in SMT than in NT plots, but no definite trends for ED were evident below 10 cm. Based on regression analyses, PR with SMT was related to ED and WC of the entire profile and most depth increments. With NT, PR was related to profile ED and WC, but only to WC for individual depths. These results indicate some strength factor largely independent of ED and affected by WC strongly influences PR of NT soil. Because NT does not disturb the soil, we concluded that stable biopores created by soil organisms and root channels reduced the effects of ED differences among NT plots and that NT soils developed a rigid structure independent of ED. Reports of improved trafficability on NT soils support this conclusion. Results of this study and previously reported crop yields suggest long-term use of NT will not impair the quality and production sustainability of this and similar soils under dryland cropping conditions.

AB Laboratory managers are facing the task of altering the attitudes of themselves and their employees in order to implement a quality lifestyle, which is the prerequisite for successful implementation of a quality system complying with appropriate international standards. The alterations require a painstaking and constructive approach. Not all laboratories have the resources to secure the assistance of quality consultants. For those laboratory managers who have to find their way towards quality management on their own: some recommendations are given for a path towards a self-sustaining quality system. Several practical aspects of the basic steps in this path, which starts with assessing the current status of the laboratory and is followed by awareness building, are discussed. The recommendations are derived from the experience of the authors in their own laboratories.

AB Sustainable development is by now generally accepted as the paramount objective of environmental policy. Environmental applications of Earth observation, on the other hand, have been successfully demonstrated over a wide range of monitoring activities, mostly with the aim of describing the spatial distribution and time course of geophysical parameters and land surface structures.
   With landuse structures being of major influence on the sustainability of terrestrial ecosystems, and being also a highly suitable object of Earth observation, it is still an open question, however, in which way Earth observation data can be processed and integrated to provide an approximate indicator of sustainability. Based on an ecological sustainability model developed by Ripl and his co-workers at Berlin Technical University, this question was investigated in the framework of the joint project "Development of a Land-Water-Management Concept to Decrease Matter Losses to Open Waters" (Stor project), which was funded by the German Federal Ministry of Research and Technology. Present results may be summarized as follows:
   1. Apart from hydrological point measurements, there are several spatial parameters which are of indicative value as to sustainability, especially the spatio-temporal distribution of biomass, surface temperature, and precipitation.
   2. To provide the spatial information basis for enhanced efficiency of immediate measures such as reforestation, agricultural extension etc., a global information system (GIS) concept was developed and demonstrated which is based on a landuse/vegetation classification derived from Landsat TM data, a digital evaluation mode (DEM) and a relief dependent water distribution model (WDM).
   Further implications such as the organisation of information systems which are to serve sustainability strategies are discussed. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; FARMERS PERCEPTIONS; INNOVATIONS
AB This paper reports results from a study of resource degradation and conservation behavior of peasant households in a degraded part of the Ethiopian highlands. Peasant households' choice of conservation technologies is modeled as a two-stage process: recognition of the erosion problem, and adoption and level of use of control practices. An ordinal logit model is used to explain parcel-level perception of the threat of the erosion problem and the extent of use of conservation practices. Results show the importance of perception of the threat of soil erosion, household, land and farm characteristics; perception of technology-specific attributes, and land quality differentials in shaping conservation decisions of peasants. Furthermore, where poverty is widespread and appropriate support policies are lacking, results indicate that population pressure per se is unable to encourage sustainable land use. The challenge of breaking the poverty-environment trap and initiating sustainable intensification thus require policy incentives and technologies that confer short-term benefits to the poor while conserving the resource base.

SO AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS

ID MICROBIAL BIOMASS; SOILS
AB The stability and resilience of two very similar soil ecosystems were challenged over an extended time by organic and conventional management systems. The responses were compared against a native soil ecosystem by following carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus balances through the biological, geological, and chemical sub-systems.
   The types and amounts of carbon inputs did not predict the resulting system contents or properties. Nitrogen and phosphorus retained in the systems were related to, but not proportional to, inputs. Carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus moved through the agroecosystems and excesses were exported to maintain stasis in the component sub-systems.
   A flow diagram was proposed to describe the stabilizing responses in these systems. The unique properties of each agroecosystem must be considered when developing sustainable management practices. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

DT Article
DE sustainability; rice systems; ecological; economic; social
AB An index was developed to measure the sustainability of rice production systems at a farm level by identifying nine indicators grouped under the three dimensions of sustainability namely ecological, economic and social. The index was applied to rice farmers sampled from irrigated, rainfed lowland, rainfed upland and tankfed rice systems. Although significant differences were found among the four systems, each system had positive and negative attributes. Rainfed lowland production was the best system followed by irrigated production. The rainfed upland system was the least sustainable. The rainfed lowland system did not dominate in any of the dimensions of sustainability but emerged as the best in a composite index. This confirms the general agreement that sustainable farming avoids maximising any single outcome variable, but instead balances all the dimensions of sustainability. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB There an widely held concerns over environmental contamination from agricultural pesticide applications, and a current policy objective in many Western European countries is to reduce usage levels. However, it appears that existing arrangements to control usage, and thence contamination, are inadequate to achieve the levels of environmental quality currently demanded; policy innovation and reform are needed. This review examines some of the problems of controlling pesticide contamination, and the potential policy instruments for achieving pesticide use reduction for environmental improvement. Particular attention is given to the role of market mechanisms to achieve environmental policy aims, especially through the introduction of financial incentives for producers to switch to integrated pest management practices involving the use of less pesticides. Instruments such as input taxes seem administratively and politically feasible, but need careful design and implementation if environmental objectives with regard to pesticides are to be achieved. Environmental economics can make an important contribution to practical agri-environmental resource management if linked with more explicit acknowledgement of the characteristics of agro-ecosystems.

TI Designating a protected area at Karanambu ranch, Rupununi Savannah,
   Guyana: Resource management and indigenous communities
SO AMBIO

DT Article
AB In 1995, the writer assessed the feasibility of designating Karanambu ranch in the northern Rupununi savannah, Guyana, as a protected area. Karanambu is one of Guyana's leading ecotourism destinations, popular because of the well-publicised interest of its owner, Diane McTurk, in conserving the endangered giant river otter (Pteronura brasiliensis). It had been suggested that such a protected area could be financed by expanding the existing ecotourism operations and connected with development programs benefitting local Macusi Amerindian communities. However, questions soon emerged concerning potential conflicts with Amerindian land rights and the effect that a protected area would have on traditional resource-management practices. Fieldwork was carried out between April and November 1995 involving Rapid Rural Appraisal of local indigenous Macusi communities, combined with an Environmental Impact Analysis at Karanambu, The study recommended the establishment of a research station at Karanambu accompanied by a small Nature Reserve, rather than a more extensive protected area. This station, already under construction, will provide a focus for visiting scientists and increase the sustainable ecotourism potential of the ranch. It is to be combined with wildlife farming to provide additional employment and economic opportunities for local communities.

TI Internally motivated development projects: A potential tool for

SO AMBIO
LA English
DT Article
AB Projects conceived and implemented internally by local communities in the developing world (Internally Motivated Projects = IMPs), inherently meet local needs, often addressing issues of livelihood security and income generation, and thus are more sustainable than externally motivated projects focused primarily on biological conservation. This paper evaluates whether internally motivated development projects exhibit resource conservation payoffs and offer an avenue for low cost and sustainable conservation outside of protected areas. IMPs were identified from the files of conservation and development agencies. Project activities were evaluated for their potential payoffs to soil, water, biodiversity conservation, and air quality. Results show that on-farm soil and water conservation are common, and acknowledged payoffs of IMPs. Biodiversity conservation payoffs do occur, but are not often explicitly recognized by the project implementers and are the secondary consequences of other activities. IMPs offer an avenue for direct resource conservation of on-farm soil, water and genetic resources, and indirect conservation of biodiversity by reducing off-farm impacts.

AB Public consciousness about biodiversity and the environment, and their importance for sustainable development is not widespread in the Philippines. This article advocates nonformal environment education through nature recreation as a means toward 'greening', the mind and the spirit of the citizens. Information is provided about biodiversity, and the status and potential of nature parks, museums, gardens, and toes in the country. Many of the 116 national parks and protected areas have been exploited for products and energy, and only some provide for recreation-cum-education. The Philippines has no national botanical garden, zoo, or aquarium, and the National Museum is not the proud institution that it should be. Some universities have small museums, botanical gardens, and other biodiversity exhibits for instruction and research, but these and the few toes and wildlife centers are poorly funded or managed.

TI Tunisia, a Mediterranean country with dry-area problems
SO AMBIO
LA English
DT Article
AB The problems of limited water resources are discussed in an historical perspective and in terms of the near future. Tunisia has a long history of human influence, man's impact on nature and natural resources having been strong since Roman times. Recent land use, or rather abuse, has caused soil degradation, in the form of soil erosion, decreases in soil organic matter, nitrogen and phosphorus, as well as salinization of arable soil and soil desiccation through the overexploitation of groundwater. Future development must build on a far more efficient use of water. Improvement of water management is, therefore, a priority, for groundwater as well as surface water. Detailed knowledge of the water balance, and of various types of water resources, is a prerequisite for future planning of land allocation for agriculture, arboriculture, horticulture, as well as for pasturing, reforestation, and for nature reserves for biotopes and biota. The future of the rural population requires a change toward increased productivity in as sustainable a system as possible, which also entails simultaneous urban development.

AB . Rare vascular plant species are endangered worldwide. Population losses are most commonly caused by human-related factors. Conservation management seeks to halt this adverse trend and if possible, to enhance long-lasting self-sustainable populations. In general, rare species are poorly recruited from seed banks, or disperse themselves very poorly. It may be a management option to translocate such plants by seeds and/or transplants. This paper asks which problems may be faced. It is argued that translocation is only acceptable if it is based on knowledge of species biology and ecology and the size and structure of its geographic range through time. Such knowledge of rare species is often lacking. The finite management goal can only be achieved if conservationists closely cooperate with both ecologists and geneticists.

AB . A small-scale restoration experiment concerning a species-rich calcareous grassland was conducted over a 7-yr period. 20 yr of abandonment (1971-1990) resulted in both a strong reduction of the number of species and an absolute dominance of the shrub Crataegus monogyna and the grass Brachypodium pinnatum - which contributed 98% of the above-ground herb phytomass. The plot (3 m x 6 m) was cleared in September 1990 and thereafter yearly mown in autumn. Small soil seed bank samples were taken immediately after clearing and again in the autumn of 1996. The inner part of the plot showed a reduced soil seed bank compared to the plot underneath the vegetation outside the plot in 1990. Six years later an increased number of seeds in the soil in this inside area could be recorded mainly in the upper soil layer, although the amount was only 40% compared to the outside or control area. Ca. 20% of the species present in the restored vegetation were recorded in seed traps during the main seed dispersal period in 1997. Restoration of high species richness in the plot was a fast process during the first few years: from seven species in 1990 towards 39 three years later. This was significantly faster than the restoration process of the calcareous grassland at the same slope 20 yr earlier. This was probably due to the increased size of the community species pool at the site as a result of appropriate management during the last decades. Relative species number increase was highest at the largest scale during this experiment, viz. at the total plot area. The success of restoration of species-rich, dry grassland vegetation largely depends on the interaction between several conditions, e.g. seed availability, either originating from the seed rain or soil seed bank, favourable germination conditions and a successful development to a mature, seed producing individual. Germination and establishment strongly depend on suitable vegetation structure as a result of sustainable management.

AB Pond culture of marine shrimp currently accounts for about 30% of world supply and production continues to expand. The future success of shrimp farming will depend upon increasing supplies of healthy, high quality seed for stocking ponds. Tn many areas, fry are still collected from the wild for stocking into ponds. To stabilize seed supplies and expand to new areas, hatchery production technologies have improved slowly over the past 20 years. Challenges associated with disease control and reducing reliance on natural feeds are being met through research efforts in the private and public sectors. Improved hygiene and biosecurity, development of probiotics and immunostimulants and improvement of artificial feeds promise better postlarval fitness while reducing cast and improving reliability of production. However, much of this production continues to rely on nauplii derived from wild gravid spawners collected at sea. Although techniques for captive maturation and spawning have been well defined, serious gaps remain in the basic understanding of the hormonal control of reproduction, the process of vitellogenesis in penaeid shrimp and the mechanical and physiological processes involved in fertilization. Presently, in areas with readily available indigenous stocks of species of choice, there is a generally accepted perception among hatchery managers and growers that performance of nauplii and postlarvae derived from wild matured spawners is superior to captive matured or pond reared animals. As we approach the 21st century, wild stocks are facing increasing pressure and shrimp farming continues to expand into new areas, away from traditional sources of wild seed. New viral disease epidemics continue to arise and spread quickly across entire regions, significantly impacting industry viability. Research and development efforts aimed at closing the life cycle of several commercially important species are underway. While significant limitations remain, encouraging results illustrating the potential for disease control, disease resistance and improved growth have been reported. The development of healthy, genetically improved shrimp stocks represents a tremendous economic opportunity while potentially improving the outlook for long term industry sustainability. The present paper is a review of recent developments in penaeid broodstock and seed production technologies focusing on current limitations while defining the significant potential offered by emerging developments.

AB Serious production losses have occurred in shrimp producing countries around the world, principally due to poor rearing environments and pathogenic disease. In response to this, shrimp farmers are changing their culture methods. To understand the source and sink of nutrients which affect pondwater quality and effluent impact, the nitrogen, phosphorus and solids budget have been constructed for water exchange systems. These budgets reveal the contribution of the pond bottom soil to the accumulation of sediment and phosphorus and its potential contribution of nitrogen to the pond system. A survey of shrimp farm water quality and management practices in southern Thailand has also been completed. This reveals a high proportion of farms using low water exchange methods of shrimp culture but without the ability to maintain suitable water quality in the production ponds. Shrimp production in these systems is variable due to high incidences of disease and slow growth rates. The pond processes that might cause this are suggested and potential methods for their amelioration are discussed. Alternative culture systems such as lined ponds, low salinity rearing and recirculation farms are described in relation to their potential for remediating problems within the shrimp culture industry.

AB This paper reviews the trends and economics of hatchery and grow-out phases of shrimp fanning in Asia. The economics of small, medium and large-scale hatcheries are evaluated based on a recent Philippine study. Costs and returns of shrimp grow-outs in major Asian producing countries are analyzed based on a recent farm performance survey conducted by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and Network of Aquaculture Centers in Asia-Pacific (NACA). The costs and returns of extensive, semi-intensive and intensive farming systems are compared within the producing country, and the economic efficiency of each system is compared among the major producing countries. Comparative advantage of producing and marketing of shrimp among major producing countries in Asia is also evaluated. Limitations for future development and factors affecting the sustainable growth of the shrimp industry are also discussed. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Peatswamp ecology and sustainable development in Borneo
SO BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
LA English
DT Article
DE tropical peatswamps; peatlands; conservation; biodiversity; Borneo
AB While tropical lowland peatswamp ecosystems are well-represented among the major forest formations of Borneo, they are rare outside South-East Asia. They are richly endowed with biological diversity, including the crocodile (Crocodylus porosus), which is a threatened species, and are characterized by their organic (histosol) soils that have developed recently, approximately within the past 5000 years. Their unique ecological features, as well as logistical difficulties in accessing and utilizing peatswamps, have not, however, deterred exploitation. Some of the tallest, most commercially desirable timber species, such as ramin (Gonystylus bancanus) have been harvested routinely in the peatswamp forests of Sarawak. Also, due to its primary location in coastal lowlands in close proximity to human activity, drained and reclaimed peatswamp land is desirable for development of highways, housing, and industrial and plantation estates. Ecological information is needed urgently by decision-makers and land-owners, who may be contemplating conversion of natural peatswamp ecosystems to other land uses, to undergird conservation policy and best management practices for the wise stewardship and sustainable development of this ecosystem.
   The paper provides an overview of peatswamp ecology with recommendations for avoiding or reducing potential ecological impacts associated with peatswamp development in Borneo, which include a moratorium on further development until a Borneo peatswamp survey and inventory as well as a holistic, multi-sectoral, integrated environmental assessment and planning procedure are completed; gazetting of pristine peatswamp forest parcels as totally protected areas; implementing highly restricted multiple-use policy that allows development only in degraded areas, and insuring protection of the critical hydrological role of peatswamps in providing fresh water supply for human use as an overriding criterion in assessing any development scheme.

AB Muskrat invaded Valaam Island (Northern part of European Russia) in the 1970s. Aquatic plant communities of 1962 and 1993 were compared on the same plots. Quantitative changes were tested with the help of jack-knifing estimates of most known inventory (alpha-) diversity indicators. Qualitative transformations were assessed using beta-diversity values. The results demonstrated substantially more discriminant ability of diversity measures than classical methods of mathematical statistics. All of the alpha-diversity values declined synchronously without exception. Species composition also changed greatly and those species which turn out to be more resistant to muskrat grazing became the main dominant plants. The activity of Ondatra became the over-riding ecological factor connecting the littoral plant communities of the Valaam. It is concluded that the sustainability of this ecosystem was damaged by muskrat's invasion and that the role of muskrat should not be underestimated when studying the ecology of freshwater littoral communities.

Previously, the use of agricultural waste (palm kernel shells) as a fuel was reported (Building Research and Information, 25(3), 131-136). This study reports on advances made through the substitution of charcoal made from timber off cuts and waste instead of the use of firewood to ignite the palm kernel shells.

AB After about 20 years of wide usage in integrated.pest management (IPM) programs on peach in the Niagara Peninsula of Ontario, populations of Oriental fruit moth, Grapholita molesta (Busck), resistant to azinphosmethyl and phosmet have been selected. Resistance, as expressed in first-instar larvae, was only two- to four-fold to azinphosmethyl or phosmet, but up to 45% fruit infestations have been documented in commercial blocks. Resistance to azinphosmethyl was not well expressed in adult Oriental fruit moths. In tests with larvae, cross-resistance occurred to most other organophosphorus insecticides except acephate and chlorpyrifos. Acephate was more toxic to resistant than to susceptible larvae. Resistance was higher (>100-fold) to the methyl carbamates carbaryl and carbofuran but was approximately fivefold to the carbamoyl oxime methomyl. Cross-resistance to pyrethroids was not observed. Tests with field-collected material, either from crosses on mating trays in the field or from pupae collected in cardboard bands attached to trees, indicated that resistance was widespread across the Niagara production area but that the resistance was not uniformly expressed at all locations. Resistance was expressed in F-1 larvae from crosses of susceptible females with field-collected males, indicating that the genetic change in resistant larvae was unlikely the effect of a single recessive gene. Field tests in replicated two-tree plots and in larger (0.25-0.6 ha) plots treated with up to five applications as a season-long control program indicated that neither chlorpyrifos nor acephate were as effective as a pyrethroid (deltamethrin). The sustainability of these IPM programs and potential resistance management strategies are discussed.

ID CLAIMS
AB Forest certification has emerged as a means of promoting the elusive goal of sustainable forest management. This paper reviews the economic issues and potential welfare implications of forest certification in light of this management goal, but finds that the effect of certification on forest product markets is uncertain. We examine why certification schemes may fail to regulate optimally market failures, and may actually decrease welfare compared to a non-certified state. Forest certification, it turns out, may not be the best policy tool for promoting sustainable forest management.

TI Planning for sustainable forests in British Columbia through land use
   zoning
SO CANADIAN PUBLIC POLICY-ANALYSE DE POLITIQUES
LA English
DT Article
AB Economic theory suggests that managing every hectare of forestland for multiple products, which is occurring in British Columbia, is inefficient. Using a case study for the Revelstoke area of the province, we demonstrate that spatially separating commercial timber activities from non-timber ones can lead to higher timber rents, while affording better environmental protection, including protection of critical wildlife habitat. Zoning provides an incentive to invest resources in intensive management in areas dedicated to commercial timber production, while enhancing the flow of other resource values from the unit as a whole. With zoning it is possible to avoid areas where visual and environmental amenity values are particularly sensitive, which is not possible with current, multiple-use management regimes. By focusing timber production, it is possible to reduce the forestland base, required to maintain current levels of harvest, by over 50 percent.

   SOCIOLOGIE ET D ANTHROPOLOGIE
LA English
DT Article
ID SOIL CONSERVATION; FARM STRUCTURE; PHOSPHORUS; WATERSHEDS; POLICY;
   CANADA
AB This paper examines the development of a discourse within agriculture which promotes the adoption of conservation tillage as environmentally sustainable farming. The analysis begins with the argument that the discourse emerged during the 1980s as a response to the environmental impacts of conventional agriculture. It is then argued that the focus on tillage practices over other alternative solutions to these impacts must be understood within a broader analysis of the political-economic developments in Canadian agriculture. The contradictory interests of the various sectors of agribusiness capital, both in sustaining the use of expensive chemical inputs and in controlling the prices paid to farmers within the context of the farm economic crisis, are identified as playing a vital role in shaping the focus on tillage practices. It is contended that conservation tillage offered a means of mediating these contradictions in two ways. First, conservation tillage provided a basis for the claim that chemical pollution and soil depletion problems were being resolved without the need for more substantial changes in the chemically-based production system and, second, it gave farmers a means and a rationale for cutting production;costs in the face of continuing crises in prices and profitability at the farm gate level.

AB The herbicide metolachlor has been widely used for over 20 years for selective weed control in more than 70 crops worldwide. Its favourable soil behaviour and low risk for developing weed resistance means that metolachlor integrates well into sustainable weed-management practices, such as conservation tillage. Metolachlor consists of four stereoisomers, with herbicidal activity coming mainly from the S-isomer pair. A new catalyst system developed allows the commercial production of enantiomerically-enriched S-metolachlor (ISO draft common name). In field trials carried out 1995-1996 S-metolachlor demonstrated equivalent efficacy on major grass weeds and tolerance to different maize cultivars at 65% the use rate of metolachlor. In laboratory studies in different soils degradation half-lives were similar for metolachlor and S-metolachlor. The mean half life of S-metolachlor was 23 days in dissipation studies at different European field sites. At the lower use rates and with highly concentrated formulations containing up to 96% (w/v) active ingredient, the use of S-metolachlor will result in a substantial reduction of risk to applicators, consumers and the environment and the herbicide will continue to play an important role in sustainable weed-management.

AB Environmental concerns have led to renewed interest in use of sustainable green manure legume cropping systems. Field experiments were undertaken to determine whether cowpea [Vigna unguiculata L, (Walp.)] crop residues could be used to reduce fertilizer N inputs with fall broccoli [Brassica oleracea L, (Italica Group)], Studies in 1992, 1993, and 1994 involved broccoli preceded by cowpeas, with or without factorial combinations of preplant N and sidedress N from urea on the broccoli. Control broccoli plants were grown on fallowed ground and supplied with 168 kg ha(-1)of N from urea. Cowpea crop residues alone did not provide sufficient N for optimum production of marketable broccoli. Marketable broccoli yields sometimes shelved no significant differences between controls and cowpea residue treatments receiving only 84 kg ha(-1) of fertilizer N. However, there was a tendency for increased broccoli transplant mortality in cowpea residue plots. A fourth study in 1994 indicated a negative main effect of cowpeas on broccoli stand establishment, and a complex interaction of cowpeas and trifluralin treatments on broccoli yield. Petiole N concentrations of broccoli plants,vith reduced fertilizer N inputs which succeeded cowpeas usually were lower than those of control plants. Soil nitrate levels at 15- to 30-cm soil depths at the time of broccoli planting were consistent indicators of apparent nitrate utilization by microbial decomposition of cowpea crop residues. We were unable to demonstrate a cowpea-broccoli succession cropping system which consistently reduced fertilizer N inputs without some type of adverse effect on the broccoli crop. Therefore, the use of cowpea crop residues to reduce fertilizer N inputs with fall broccoli is not recommended.

AB Changes in forest resources have been estimated in a variety of ways. This paper focuses on extensive forest surveys rather than on sentinel-site investigations. The sampling design and plot design used are key to precise estimates of change. Alternative sampling designs include temporary surveys, Continuous Forest Inventory, and Sampling with Partial Replacement. Each can be used in conjunction with stratified sampling or double sampling for stratification. Plot designs can involve variable-radius or Bitterlich sampling for trees, and fixed-area plots for most attributes. In extensive surveys, it is efficient to group plots into clusters. Plots must be sampled at a frequency that is commensurate with the rate of change, degree of interest, and funding available. Often, plots are less than a hectare in size and spaced widely across the population. Continuous Forest Inventory, with or without stratification, is efficient for estimating current values, net change, and components of change. Much work remains in scaling to understand landscape-level interactions and to identify stressors and indicators of forest health and sustainability.

AB As part of a workshop sponsored by the Sustainable Biosphere Initiative on Change and Trend Detection, we have reviewed some general considerations pertinent to establishing long-term monitoring programs. A general goal of most long-term monitoring is to assign causality and establish mechanisms for patterns in observed data. However, mechanistic inference can be difficult in complex, often uncontrolled, natural systems. We present examples from three lakes representing (1) highly manipulated, intensively monitored systems, (2) management situations where many simultaneous manipulations may be occurring, and (3) at-large surveillance programs with no deliberate manipulations. We show that at one end of this continuum, in controlled, intensively monitored lakes, delayed and counterintuitive responses can make mechanistic inference difficult. At the other end of the continuum, where no management or experimental manipulations are underway, it is still possible to ascertain mechanism in the presence of apparently conflicting data, given sufficient information about the system. Management situations are often difficult to decipher; many simultaneous manipulations often confound mechanistic interpretations, although patterns in the data are readily apparent.

AB The objective of this study was to evaluate for an 8-yr period the ecosystem-level impacts of no grazing vs. sustained moderate and heavy cattle grazing in terms of: (1) plant species basal cover, density, and composition; (2) aboveground net primary production (ANPP), N content of ANPP (ANPP-N), belowground net primary production (BNPP), and N content of BNPP (BNPP-N); (3) litter and root decomposition and N loss; and (4) soil C, total. soil N, and net in situ soil N mineralization. Moderate and heavy grazing treatments were designed to achieve an end-of-the-grazing-season residual vegetation of 50% and 10%, respectively, of the long-term average ANPP of comparable ungrazed sites. The main factor affecting the vegetation response was the increase in precipitation after the drought of 1988; few differences were due to grazing intensity. The total absolute basal cover of gasses increased steadily in all treatments, from an average of 4% during the drought of 1988 to 14% in 1993. Forb density and diversity increased from 51 plants/m(2) and 14 species in 1988 to 412 plants/m(2) and 36 species in 1995. Grazing, however, increased the relative composition of Poa pratensis and Achillea millefolium, but reduced the relative composition of Bouteloua gracilis and Aster ericoides. ANPP and ANPP-N were correlated with rainfall, but not with grazing intensity. Heavy grazing led to declines in standing dead biomass, litter, peak root biomass and biomass-N, root N concentrations, and in situ net soil N mineralization. There was an increase in root decomposition and N loss with grazing. From this study, we reached the following conclusions about the northern mixed-grass prairie: (1) climatic variations, in particular draughts, control major trends in plant species composition and production, with grazing playing a secondary role; (2) heavy grazing leads to declines in standing dead biomass and biomass-N, litter biomass and biomass-N, peak root biomass and biomass-N, and in situ net soil N mineralization, which may have a significant long-term impact on range condition; and (3) grazing pressures that lead to a removal of 50% of ANPP, however, seem to be sustainable and compatible with the maintenance of range condition.

AB Improvements in some measures of air and water quality can accompany rising per capita income, as illustrated by the so-called environmental Kuznets curve. For pollution variables which show such a relationship, we hypothesize that a more equitable distribution of power contributes to these outcomes, by enhancing the influence on policy of those who bear the costs of pollution, relative to the influence of those who benefit from pollution-generating activities. An empirical analysis of international variations in seven indicators of air and water quality supports this hypothesis. Literacy, political rights, and civil liberties are found to have particularly strong effects on environmental quality in low-income countries. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Recent empirical research indicates that certain types of emissions follow an inverted-U or environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) as income grows. This regularity has been interpreted as a possible de-linking of economic growth and patterns of certain pollutants for developed economies. In this paper the empirical basis of this result is investigated by considering some statistical particularities of the various EKC studies performed. It is argued that the inverted-U relationship between income and emissions estimated from panel data need not hold for specific individual countries over time. Based on insights from 'intensity-of-use' analysis in resource economics, an alternative growth model is specified and estimated for three types of emissions (CO2, NOx and SO2) in four countries (Netherlands, UK, USA and Western Germany). It is found that the time patterns of these emissions correlate positively with economic growth and that emission reductions may have been achieved as a result of structural and technological changes in the economy. 'Sustainable growth' is defined as the rate of economic growth that does not lead to growth in emissions. Its rate is calculated for each type of emission and country, based on estimated parameter values. The resulting indicators reflect a balance between the positive influence of growth and negative influence of structural change and technological progress on emission levels.

ID ENERGY
AB By means of a systemic analysis of the relationships among components of a system's web, the flows of energy and other resources converging to produce the output (biomass, biodiversity, assets, industrial products) can be evaluated on a common basis, i.e. the content of solar equivalent energy (hereafter, emergy; Odum, H.T., 1996. Environmental Accounting. Emergy and Environmental Decision-Making. Wiley, New York). Indices and ratios based on emergy flows can be calculated and used to evaluate the behavior of the whole system. Their dependence upon the fraction of renewable and nonrenewable inputs as well as locally available versus purchased inputs from outside is stressed. A new index of sustainability is also defined and applied to case studies. The trends of these indices provide useful information about the dynamics of economic systems within the carrying capacity of the environment in which they develop. When a particular sector or production process is focused on, instead of a national economy, emergy based indices provide insights into the thermodynamic efficiency of the process, the quality of its output, and the interaction between the process and its surrounding environment.

AB I offer some reflections on ecology and natural resource management from a systems perspective. More specifically, I consider what the systems perspective offers to address current problems/opportunities in environmental education, ecological research, and natural resource management, and how systems thinkers in the international societies of ecological modeling, ecological engineering, ecological economics, and ecosystem health can help promote this perspective. Arguably the most critical problem that any of us face is recognizing causal relationships in the complex systems in which we work and live. The systems approach-the process of conceptualizing, quantifying, evaluating, and using a simulation model-allows us to identify causal relationships in complex systems that cannot be identified by other methods of problem solving. Within the context of environmental education, the systems approach facilitates integrative thinking, active versus passive learning, and unambiguous communication. Within the context of ecological research, the systems approach facilitates development of testable predictions through a synthesis of inductive and deductive reasoning. Within the context of natural resource management, the systems approach provides a basis for sustainable, multiple use of natural resources by facilitating multidisciplinary planning and creation of an effective communication interface between scientists and policy makers. Systems thinkers in our four societies need to be more assertive in promoting the systems perspective. I believe the only way to deliver the systems message effectively is through apprenticeships in which participants are involved actively in the process of developing and using system dynamics models under supervision of experienced modelers. Those of us at universities can supervise semester-long systems modeling projects, either within the context of formal courses or as 'special problems' courses. But we need to explore additional ways of providing modeling apprenticeships to a wider audience. A formal for delivering a useful initial exposure to the systems message beyond our home institution consists of intensive 2-5-day workshops conducted on-site at host institutions. Our experience suggests that workshop participants can include a multidisciplinary, multi-vocational mix of students, teachers, researchers, managers, policy makers, and other professionals. I challenge each of you to leach at least one such systems modeling workshop per year. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

DE sustainability AWFUL theorem; proportional disadvantage
AB Many momentarily important concepts in science pass after a time with little enduring consequence. Sustainability has the potential to become a really significant idea, but it could also disappear if it never becomes formally implemented to make it operational. To do this requires clarifying its various meanings, then integrating these into a measure or model, preferably quantitative. This paper makes a start at this employing propositional logic-first to establish that the success of any species requires proportional disadvantage to others in a zero-sum world (the AWFUL theorem), and then to explore three possible properties of sustainability (stabilily, continuation, and longevity) at two different levels of system organization (whole and part). The following conclusions are reached and discussed: at a given scale of organization, for sustainability (1) stability is a necessary but not sufficient condition, (2) continuation is sufficient but not necessary, and (3) longevity is also sufficient but not necessary. Across scales, between wholes and parts: (1a) part stability is sufficient for whole system sustainability, and part instability can be compensated by system design to achieve sustainability; (1b) system instability is sufficient for part unsustainability; (2a) part continuation is sufficient for system continuation, and therefore system sustainability; (2b) part noncontinuation is necessary for system unsustainability; (3a) part longevity is sufficient for system longevity, and therefore system sustainability: and (3b) failure of parts to achieve longevity is a necessary condition for system-level unsustainability. These attributes of sustainability in the part-whole context do not exhaust the possibilities. There are also comparisons to be made of relations between different sustainability attributes. The examples given indicate that sustainability is not a simple concept and that considerable development will be necessary to mold it into a permanently useful scientific tool.

AB Recent advances in artificial intelligence in general: and in machine learning in particular, enable scientists to apply new machine learning technics to their specific areas. In our work we apply such a machine learning technique to the modelling of population dynamics of red deer for the 40000 hectares co-natural manage forest area on high Karst of Notranjska in Slovenia. We used the RETIS program, a machine learning tool developed by A. Karalie at the Institute Jozef Stefan in Ljubljana. This program induces regression trees from data, and has already been applied to several ecological problems. RETIS was applied on data, collected in the period 1976-1994, which included several meteorological parameters, parameters about the state of the forest, and parameters about the population of the red deer. Given these data about the observed system, the system RETIS automatically induces a model which has the form of a regression tree. We evaluate our induced models qualitatively and quantitatively. For the qualitative evaluation, we present an expert interpretation of the models. We show that quantitatively, using the models (we use a relative prediction error) and given the meteorological parameters during winter and summer and an estimate of the number of red deer in the area, it is possible to predict the state of the forest in the near future. This is very important for maintaining the balance between red deer population and other parameters of the forest, which will allow sustainable development of the complex forest ecosystem.

AB The necessity for policy makers to follow the processes in relation to sustainability demands new tools for management, a major aspect of which is integrated attention to economic and sociocultural influences together with environmental issues. North and South have specific positions and responsibilities with regard to sustainable development, and management tools-such as indicators-should reflect them. Because the North-South dialogue is changing, different approaches to deal,vith the relationships are needed (e.g., introduction of reciprocity, equity, and participation), while at the same time doing justice to the individual social, economic, and cultural characteristics of a country. Ecosystem health can be defined by requirements such as resilience, vigor, organization, and relations, which may be used for totally different systems as well. Because integration is a crucial aspect of the new tools, it is argued that integrating conceptual tools such as the environment-economy-society triangle, the PSIR-causality chain, and the Daly triangle in addition to other described integration tools is fundamental for decision makers. Crucial issues when dealing with indicators for sustainable development are integration and balance, attention to users, use of system characteristics, and understanding southern perspectives in this context, (C) 1998 Academic Press.

AB In the further development and implementation of European legislation on chemicals and related products the following aspects and trends can be identified: (1) refinement and adaptation of existing legislation and guidelines to technical progress (including extension of testing and risk assessment strategies), (2) preparation and implementation of new directives and regulations, (3) increasing application and further development of screening methods and model approaches, and (4) global harmonization of hazard and risk assessment criteria and procedures in the frame of the International Forum on Chemical Safety (chapter 19 of Agenda 21). The increasing use of evaluation and screening models can be illustrated by the further development and application of specific models such as EUSES and EASE to predict effect and exposure data. On the effects assessment side, models are available or under development to predict the phototoxicity and potential endocrine disrupters (estrogen/androgen binding affinity) of industrial chemicals. Finally, the emphasis that is given worldwide to the global harmonization procedures initiated under chapter 19 of Agenda 21, agreed at the UNCED conference for the environment and sustainable development in 1992, cannot fail to influence further developments in Europe.

AB Domestic heating and cooling is responsible for a fair percentage of world energy consumption. Heat pumps offer the most energy efficient way to provide heating and cooling in many applications, as they can use renewable heat sources of the building's surroundings. A number of related heat pump technology versions exist that have led to significantly lower heating and cooling energy consumption in certain climatic conditions. In this paper, a comparative discussion is giver. of the effect of climatic conditions on applying ground source heat pump technologies. Specific examples are given for northern and southern parts of Europe. It is shown that the attainable building energy consumption reduction with ground source heat pump systems may be significantly higher in the warmer Mediterranean climatic conditions. To this end, advanced technology residential heat pump systems should be employed and their operation matched to the specific climatic conditions. It is concluded that climatic conditions significantly affect the performance of heat pump systems, which should lead to markedly different strategies for domestic heating and cooling, if an optimization is sought on sustainability grounds.

AB The experience of creating common pool resources with the purpose of better management is quite common in several parts of the world. There are some situations of such pooled resources managed almost as an open access resource and elsewhere, as a perfect common property resource. It is hypothesized here that quite often such pooling processes begin as open access resources and only with experience do they slowly become transformed into common property resources. The rate of such a transformation and degree of pooling intensity depend upon many factors, including leadership commitment, and the associated rules of the repeated game. A model of such a pooling process is formulated to test this and several other hypotheses. Empirical evidence from a case study is provided followed by some hypothetically simulated cases.

AB The conventional development paradigm assumes that the values, consumption patterns, and dynamics of the western industrial system will be progressively played out on a global scale. In this inquiry, we explore the implications of the conventional paradigm for the evolution of global energy patterns, and the compatibility with notions of sustainability. The present a global long-range conventional development scenario to the year 2050, and identify major environmental, resource, and social pressures and uncertainties. These include the economic and geopolitical consequences of fossil fuel depletion, the environmental and security implications of increased nuclear generation, the risk of significant climatic change, and the threats to social cohesion of distributional inequities. Such potential problems could negate the basic scenario assumption of steady economic and social development. By clarifying the stress points in a conventional picture of energy development, the scenario provides a useful point of departure for examining alternative long-range scenarios for sustainable energy development.

DE groundwater development; aquifer overexploitation
AB In evaluating groundwater development both the positive and negative effects must be considered; otherwise biased conclusions may be reached. Only with equal concern for the needs of present and future generations, fair exchange of technology between countries and user involvement can sustainable groundwater development be achieved. Examination of the use of the term aquifer overexploitation shows that there is no agreement on a single definition. In most cases it relates to the overuse of aquifers, but in other cases it is a planned overuse. In Spain, overexploitation is dealt with in the water act and implemented by the regulations that enforce that act. Experience has shown that without the cooperation of the water users themselves, good results are not obtained. Relevant education is urgently needed for the public and those decision makers responsible for determining the correct use of groundwater resources for the present and future generations.

AB The economic and environmental consequences of soil nitrogen tests can have significant impacts on agricultural production. Some of these are explored here. The pre-side-dress soil N-test is evaluated for a hypothetical farmer growing corn at the ARS Sustainable Agriculture Demonstration Farm site in southern Maryland. For a farmer not currently using a soil N-test, adoption of this technology can lead to the enhancement of net farm income and the reduction in nitrogen loss to the environment. This will transpire only if the farmer is currently underestimating nitrogen carryover by more than 25% or applying nitrogen fertilizer based solely on an expected plateau-yield goal.

ID LEACHATE
AB Land-based point and diffuse pollution sources in the catchment area of Lake Sapanca, Turkey, were investigated. The present and future distribution of pollution loads were evaluated in terms of nitrogen, phosphorus, biochemical oxygen demand, and pesticides. A methodology for the estimation of pollution loads was presented; most of which were based on "unit loads." Presently domestic End industrial point sources dominate over diffuse sources including fertilizers and pesticides from agricultural use, nutrient loads from forests and meadows, urban runoff, and leachates from unregulated dumps of solid wastes. For the future, the aim of the control action is to maintain the sustainability of the water quality of the lake, at least at the second class of European Community standards. Within this framework; urgent/short-term and medium/long-term control actions will be exercised. In the urgent/short-term stage, simpler and natural ways of treatment will be employed. In the medium/long-term stage an integrated collection and treatment system will be put on operation. After completion of a proposed collection system and treatment plants to handle point sources, the control of diffuse sources will be more significant. Control of diffuse sources for the abatement of further deterioration of water quality then becomes the key issue to be emphasized in the Lake Sapanca catchment area. Diffuse sources control will be achieved by dividing the catchment area into three major protection zones. Use of pesticides and fertilizers on agricultural land and all other activities within these protection zones will be accomplished according to control plans, which will be supervised by an institution established to be responsible of ail the activities within the basin.

ID GULF; SEDIMENTS; WAR; OIL
AB The coastal environment of Kuwait has been under considerable stress since the onset of the oil era in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Oil, sewage, and industrial pollution were believed to be the main environmental problems in the coastal zone. The huge oil spill and destruction caused by the Gulf War further complicated those problems. in this article, the temperature, pH, salinity, and total dissolved sulfide (TDS) of the interstitial water in the intertidal zone and the water content and total organic carbon (TOC) of the intertidal sediment were investigated. The purpose of the study was to understand the effect of the physicochemical characteristics on the intertidal benthic ecology and to identify the level and sources of organic pollution in the intertidal zone. The study results indicated that the prevailing harsh environmental conditions, especially high temperature and salinity, restricted benthic fauna diversity and led to the development of a fragile intertidal ecosystem. The fauna inhabiting the intertidal zone was dominated by a few species probably living at their limit of tolerance. Organic pollution was evident mainly in Sulaibikhat Bay and to a lesser extent in Kuwait City waterfront and Shuaiba coast in the south. The pollution was attributed mainly to land-based sources such as the occasional discharge of raw sewage through stormwater outlets, the direct oil spillage, and industrial effluents from refineries, oil terminals, and petrochemical plants. Quantitative analysis was inconclusive in establishing a significant correlation between the chemistry and composition of the benthic fauna. However, close examination of sites with high TOC and TDS concentrations indicated that the benthic fauna in those sites was showing evidence of degradation. number of strategies were recommended to ensure protection and sustainable management of the coastal environment.

AB This study analyses the social and political discourses related to environment and sustainable development in Costa Rica. The central interest is on those development institutions and ideologies that promote social interventions in the name of sustainable development, and on those social processes and economic relations on which the discursive formation of environment and sustainability is articulated. Four different kinds of ideologies of environmental sustainability are analysed: Environmentalism for Nature, Environmentalism for Profit, Environmentalism for the People, and Alternative Environmentalism. The study highlights the complexity of political discourses that construct the relationship between nature and society, and the multiplicity of the means by which the control over natural resources, within the internally differentiated development apparatus, is defined.

AB We study determinants and consequences of sharp reductions in current account imbalances (reversals) in low- and middle-income countries. We pose two questions: what triggers reversals, and what factors explain how costly reversals are? We find that both domestic variables, such as the current account balance, openness and the level of reserves, and external variables, such as terms of trade shocks, US real interest rates and growth in industrial countries, seem to play an important role in explaining reversals in current-account imbalances. We also find some evidence that countries with a less appreciated real exchange rate, higher investment and more openness prior to the reversal tend to grow faster after a reversal occurs.

TI The mathematics of breaking away and chasing in cycling
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE bicycle racing; breakaways; drafting; mathematical model
ID PERFORMANCE; RUNNERS
AB In cycling stage races a small group of riders will often form a "breakaway" and establish a lead over the main group. This paper examines the factors that affect the likelihood of success for the breakaway. A mathematical approach is used, drawing on a model of cycling previously developed and validated (Olds et al. J Appl Physiol 78:1596-1611, 1995). In a breakaway group, the power required to overcome air resistance is reduced because the lead can be shared, with trailing riders sheltering or drafting behind leading riders. The benefit of drafting can be quantified as a function of the distance between riders using previously obtained data. Of course, this advantage is even greater in the (larger) chasing group, so that eventually the chasing group will catch the breakaway, assuming identical bicycles and physiological characteristics. The question addressed is: what factors determine how great a lead the breakaway must have in order for the chasing group to be unable to catch the breakaway before the finish of the race? Demand-side simulations show that the critical factors are: the distance remaining in the race. the speed of the breakaway group; the number of riders in the chasing and breakaway groups; how closely riders in each group draft one another; the grade; surface roughness; as well as head-and cross-winds. When supply-side physiological factors are incorporated, the maximum sustainable speed and maximum lead time can be calculated.

AB The concept of "sustainability" is central to forest management in Canada today. Sustainable forest management strategies are deemed to be so (a) with respect to the values for which the forest is being managed, and (b) given the forest characterization used in design of those strategies. If the values of concern are changed, and/or forest characterization used in strategy formulation is changed, the verdict about sustainability of the strategy will also change. Dramatic changes in forest values and forest characterization have occurred in the last two decades, making "sustainability" a moving target The future is apt to be no different Thus, one challenge to forest management is to change, that is to incorporate new values, better biological understanding, and more accurate forest characterization data to devise management strategies which are deemed sustainable in the context of the day. A second challenge is to design management in a way which facilitates discovery and explanation of flaws in existing strategies and which enables continual improvement through systematic strategy revision. The first challenge suggests the need for a flexible and responsive management design system, and the second, a stable foundation underpinning that system. This paper analyses evolution of forest management on Crown Land in New Brunswick since passage of landmark legislation in 1980 and use of one management design approach as it has been applied to progress toward the moving target of sustainable forest management. Lessons from the past 18 years may have application in the next 18 years.

DT Article
ID ENVIRONMENTAL-IMPACT ASSESSMENT
AB In June 1997, we visited the Magnifica Comunita di Fiemme (MCF), a community forest in the Alps of northern Italy. We have prepared this article to help broaden the perspectives of Forestry Chronicle readers on community forests and what they mean in various parts of the world. We first describe the area and its forests, and then give a brief history of the MCF. Then we review the forest-management strategies used in this Norway spruce forest, and summarize the logging and wood-processing activities of the enterprise. We continue with a comparison of this community forest with three community forests in Canada, concluding that generalization on what makes a community forest successful is dangerous - each situation is unique. Finally, given that the MCF recently won permission to use the eco-label of the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC), we discuss our perceptions of how the MCF operation does and does not meet the FSC's Principles and Criteria of Forest Stewardship. Despite several shortcomings, we believe that the MCF is in most respects a sound example of sustainable forest management.

TI Toward governance for future generations - How do we change course?
SO FUTURES
LA English
DT Article
AB In 1987, the UN World Commission on Environment and Development-perhaps better known as the Brundtland Commission-concluded that our present societal course is irresponsible toward future generations. Ten years later, we have hardly come closer to a solution of our planet's long-range problems. But how do we change the course? Are there viable pathways that can take us from the present stalemate to a society that cares for future generations? The bottleneck is not a lack of good proposals for approaching sustainability. It is rather the lack of strength to implement them. Discussions about strategies and motors of social change have very often been absent on the 'green' agenda, but exceptions do exist. This article will present and analyse main strategic profiles within an expanding flora of literature about sustainability. (C) 1998 published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

DT Article
AB As a concept sustainability has captured our imaginations and aspirations. As a tangible and identifiable goal it eludes us. Having developed indicators to measure and monitor economic, social and environmental conditions, we want now to measure sustainability. Our emphasis on the physical, the objective, and the rational, however, sees only the external manifestations of sustainability. The internal manifestations of sustainability, the non-material, the subjective, and the experiential, are put to one side, since they are messy, interpretive and time-consuming-the world of hermeneutics. Sustainability, however, is more than a 'thing' to be measured, since it is about ecological integrity, quality of life and transformation or transcendence. Rather than ask how we can measure sustainability, it may be more appropriate to ask how we measure up to sustainability. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Six dangerous myths about pay
SO HARVARD BUSINESS REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
AB Every day, executives make decisions about pay, and they do so in a landscape that's shifting. As more and more companies base less of their compensation on straight salary and look to other financial options, managers are bombarded with advice about the best approaches to take.
   Unfortunately, much of that advice is wrong. Indeed, much of the conventional wisdom and public discussion about pay today is misleading, incorrect, or both. The result is that business people are adopting wrong headed notions about how to pay people and why. In particular, they are subscribing to six dangerous myths about pay.
   Myth #1: labor rates are the same as labor costs.
   Myth #2: cutting labor rates will lower labor costs.
   Myth #3: labor costs represent a large portion of a company's total costs.
   Myth #4: keeping labor costs low creates a potent and sustainable competitive edge.
   Myth #5: individual incentive pay improves performance.
   Myth #6: people work primarily for the money.
   The author explains why these myths are so pervasive, shows where they go wrong, and suggests how leaders might think more productively about compensation.
   With increasing frequency, the author says, he sees managers harming their organizations by buying into-and acting on-these myths. Those that do, he warns, are probably doomed to endless tinkering with pay that at the end of the day will accomplish little but cost a lot.

AB Heightened awareness of the economic value of good quality multidisciplinary data sets, both to UK science and UK Ltd, has ensured that data management now has a high priority. As a result all new Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) Thematic Programmes must therefore have a data management strategy based on the NERC Data Policy. This paper describes the data management strategy for NERC's Land Ocean Interaction Study and the GIS tool used to help implement it in one of the programme's data centres. Many of the issues raised and addressed by this data management strategy are relevant to any major multidisciplinary project. (C) 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

ID MULTISTAGE INTERCONNECTION NETWORKS; PERFORMANCE; PROCESSOR; BENES
AB Based on a model of a parallel vector computer with a shared memory, its scalability properties are derived. The processor-memory interconnection network is assumed to be composed of crossbar switches of size b x b. This paper analyzes sustainable peak performance under optimal conditions, i.e., no memory bank conflicts, sufficient processor-memory bank pathways, and no interconnection network conflicts. It will be shown that, with fully vectorizable algorithms and no communication overhead, the sustainable peak performance does not scale up linearly with the number of processors p, If the interconnection network is unbuffered, the number of memory banks must increase at least with O(p log(b) p) to sustain peak performance. If the network is buffered, this bottleneck can be alleviated; however, the half performance vector length still increases with O(log(b) p). The paper confirms the validity of the model by examining the performance behavior of the LINPACK benchmark.

AB We introduce the concepts of conservative cell loss ratio (CLR) estimation and worst case cell arrival patterns, and apply them to cell arrival patterns that conform to the generic cell rate algorithm (GCRA). We define new sets of cell arrival patterns which contain the worst case cell arrival patterns for conforming cell arrival patterns. Based on these sets, we propose an upper bound formula using the burst tolerance as well as peak cell rate and sustainable cell rate, and develope a connection admission control method that guarantees cell loss ratio performance satisfying its objective.

AB Animal production results in conversion of feeds into valuable products such as meat, milk, eggs, and wool as well as into unavoidable and less desirable waste products. Intensification of animal numbers and increasing urbanization has resulted in considerable attention to odorous gases produced from animal wastes. It is clear that animal manure was, and still is, a valuable resource. However, it may be a major obstacle to future development of the animal industry if its impact on the environment is not properly controlled. Poor odor prevention and control from animal wastes is related to a lack of knowledge of the fundamental nature of odor and its production by farm animals. Odor, like noise, is a nuisance or disturbance and there is no universally accepted definition of an objectionable odor. Thus, regulation and control of odors in the environment is difficult because of the technical difficulties of defining odor limits and their measurement and evaluation. A variety of direct (sensory) and indirect (analytical instruments) methods for measuring odor intensity and determination of individual or key odor components are discussed. The biological origins of the four principal classes of odor compounds, namely branched-and straight-chain VFA, ammonia and volatile amines, indoles and phenols, and the volatile sulfur-containing compounds, are reviewed. Because more than 50% of N from animals is excreted as urea, one strategy to conserve N in waste is to inhibit the urease enzyme that converts urea to ammonia. Laboratory studies to evaluate di-and triamide compounds to control urea hydrolysis in slurries of cattle and swine wastes are presented. Finally, a brief overview of various intervention strategies is provided. Multiple combinations of nutritional management, housing systems, treatment options as well as storage and disposal of animal wastes will be required to reduce environmental pollution and provide for long-term sustainable growth.

TI Environmental compatibility of municipal solid waste incinerator bottom
   slag: Evidence from long time lysimeter experiments with Vitis vinifera
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED BOTANY-ANGEWANDTE BOTANIK
LA English
DT Article
AB In a field experiment with Vitis vinifera grown up in lysimeter pods with Keuper or Loess as soil substrates, the effect of a top layer of municipal solid waste incinerator slag on the chemical composition of the lysimeter effluent and uptake of solutes from the effluent into vine leaves and grapes was investigated over a period of two years. Experimental results of this worst case study demonstrate that the washout of heavy metals from the slag layer by natural rainfall and irrigation water is low. After an initial peak heavy metal concentration approach after 500 days concentrations of the control lysimeters. Throughout the time of the experiment heavy metal concentrations remained far below the standards for drinking water as given by the TVO. No significant accumulation of heavy metals in leaves and grapes of vines growing with a top layer of slag could be detected in comparison to the control plants. This indicates only a minor uptake of these elements from the slag effluent percolating the rhizosphere of the sublayer or Keuper or Loess. Measured contents were always orders of magnitudes below phytotoxic values. Data confirm earlier results that heavy metals in slag are largely immobile due to the alkaline pH of its soil solution and no hazardous contamination of the ground water takes place. Therefore the application of processed incinerator slag as construction material according to the roles of LAGA (1994) is sustainable to the environment. Boron in the slag plays an exceptional role in so far as its concentration in the effluents of slag lysimeters increased throughout the experiments and that leaves and grapes exhibited a continuous accumulation of this element. No alarming contamination of the ground water was detected so far and maximal boron levels in the plants remained under phytotoxic levels. Data require a close follow up of boron leaching from slag over even longer time periods as investigated in this study.

TI Informal credit and rural small enterprises growth - A local-level
   perspective on sustainable development in Vihiga, Western Kenya
SO JOURNAL OF ASIAN AND AFRICAN STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
AB The broad question addressed in this analysis is the role of small enterprises in rural sustainable development. The focus is on the contributions of informal credit in light of the dismal performance of formal credit to which the majority of rural dwellers, specifically small enterprise owners, do not have access.
   The data collected from Vihiga, Western Kenya, using the rural rapid assessment method, exposes an almost complete lack of interaction of small enterprise owners with formal institutions of credit such as commercial banks, nonbank financial institutions, co-operatives, etc. The only exception is a recent government special credit program, Rural Enterprise Fund, designed along the lines of cheap credit of the 1970s, but all the same significant in terms of filling the void.
   It is informal credit, from borrowing and lending between individuals and from groups, such as Rotating Savings and Credit Associations (ROSCAs), which has proved to be the determining factor in the origins and growth of small enterprises in the rural sector. The owners of these enterprises confirm that they have benefited both economically and socially. However, they report problems of inaccessible and insufficient credit that need to be addressed at policy level.

AB Evaluating landscape change requires the integration of the social and natural sciences. The social sciences contribute to articulating societal values that govern landscape change, while the natural sciences contribute to understanding the biophysical processes that are influenced by human activity and result in ecological change. Building upon Aldo Leopold's criteria for landscape health, the roles of societal values and biophysical processes in shaping the landscape are explored. A framework is developed for indicators of landscape health and integrity. Indicators of integrity are useful in measuring biological condition relative to the condition in landscapes largely unaffected by human activity, while indicators of health are useful in evaluating changes in highly modified landscapes.
   Integrating societal goals and biophysical processes requires identification of ecological services to be sustained within a given landscape. It also requires the proper choice of temporal and spatial scales. Societal values are based upon inter-generational concerns at regional scales (e.g. soil and ground water quality). Assessing the health and integrity of the environment at the landscape scale over a period of decades best integrates societal values with underlying biophysical processes.
   These principles are illustrated in two contrasting case studies: (1) the South Platte River study demonstrates the role of complex biophysical processes acting at a distance; and (2) the Kissimmee River study illustrates the critical importance of social, cultural and economic concerns in the design of remedial action plans. In both studies, however interactions between the social and the biophysical governed the landscape outcomes. The legacy of evolution and the legacy of culture requires integration for the purpose of effectively coping with environmental change. (C) 1998 Academic Press.

AB One of the key issues facing the environmental manager is the sustainable management of solid waste. Recovery of this waste for recycling often presents the best practical environmental option and companies, industry and Government have set a number of targets for its recycling. A particular challenge is encountered when waste recovery depends on voluntary action. Currently, there is no means of predicting the performance of these voluntary schemes in advance. This paper presents a new mathematical model of waste recovery that can potentially enable these predictions to be made. The model utilizes a process simulation approach to describe the material balance from consumption to discard. Now partitions within the balance are governed by human decisions. In the model these decisions are represented by probability-distribution functions comprising an explained component and an unexplained random component. The explained component is linked to the demographics of the sample population. The key antecedent factors that affect the human decisions have been delineated from a literature survey of the psychological factors affecting recycling. Their representation in the model is consistent with established theories of recycling behaviour The new model is able to provide simultaneous time-series predictions of scheme participation rates, total weights of material collected and the composition of this material. The model has been tested on a newspaper kerbside collection scheme and has produced good fits to all measured indicators of recycling performance. The model has additionally predicted the existence and correct scale of observed local variations in recycling behaviours between streets. The potential use of the model as an environmental-management fool is discussed with reference to establishing new collection schemes and to the optimization of the performance of existing schemes.

TI International actors and social policy development in
   Bosnia-Herzegovina: Globalism and the 'new feudalism'
SO JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN SOCIAL POLICY
LA English
DT Article
AB This article outlines the current development of aspects of social policy in Bosnia-Herzegovina, paying particular attention to the roles of diverse international actors. Bosnia-Herzegovina is seen as an example of a 'new feudalist' social formation in which the common citizenship model of 'normal' welfare regimes does not apply as a result of (a) separatist ethnicized claims and loyalties and (b) the fragmentation and multiplication of political authority. The redevelopment of social welfare structures is hampered by the competing and inconsistent visions and activities of ethnicized, local, national, international and supranational institutions. Dilemmas for supranational agencies such as the World Bank and UN agencies involved in policy advice are, therefore, of a different order to those found in other post-socialist states in the region. In addition, the large presence of International NGOs has not supported the building of a sustainable public policy for the social protection of the population. Support for local NGO development and for 'civil society' has also had unforeseen negative consequences. Through relating the roles and activities of diverse agencies to various programmes of social assistance, health care, and social care, the article argues that a policy vacuum, in part a product of the competition and disarticulation between supranational, national governmental, and non-governmental organizations, actually reinforces 'new feudalist' trends. An alternative conception of social policy as integrative social development is outlined.

AB Intercepted saline groundwaters and drainage effluent from irrigation are commonly stored in both natural and artificial saline disposal basins throughout the Murray-Darling Basin of Australia. Their continued use as wastewater evaporation sites requires an understanding of existing groundwater dynamics. The useful lifetimes of individual basins, their sustainability and possible environmental impacts remain largely unknown. In this work, the movement of salt to the underlying groundwater system from Lake Tutchewop, a saline disposal complex in north-central Victoria, was modelled in cross-section. Due to the salinity contrast between the hypersaline basin waters and the regional groundwater, it was necessary to simulate density dependent flow behaviour. Under certain conditions, these density-stratified systems may become unstable leading to the onset of convective behaviour, which greatly increases the movement of salt from the basin to the groundwater system. Modelled concentration profiles in the aquifer system and calculated seepage rates from the basin show that Lake Tutchewop is stable under its present operating regime. The downward movement of salt is mainly controlled by diffusion and dispersion. The calibrated model was used to assess the impact of several management scenarios using time-dependent boundary conditions for lake salinity and water levels. The influence of heterogeneous basin linings on ensuing salt flux rates is examined, and results show that increased solute transport will occur under such conditions. A sensitivity analysis performed on governing variables showed that salt fluxes were most sensitive to lake salinity levels. A solute Rayleigh number defined in terms of basin salinity and hydrogeologic parameters is seen to be an effective tool for predicting the long term behaviour of such saline disposal basins. The models and concepts developed in this work may find application in the design and management of saline disposal complexes. (C) 1998 Published by Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Sustainable development practices should be embraced not only to forestall environmental destruction and resource exhaustion, but also to prevent conflicts apparently triggered by these causes. Unfortunately, environmentally-caused conflicts are perhaps most likely to erupt in the world's poorest states, which are least capable of pursuing sustainable development without substantial external aid. The global assistance burden is felt primarily by multilateral developments agencies, such as the World Bank, which distributes more than USD 20 billion annually. Interestingly, the Bank acts as Trustee for the sizable Global Environment Facility (GEF) which was specifically designed to add environmental dimensions to projects funded for more general development purposes. Ironically, before the GEF was created, the World Bank was long criticized for funding unsustainable development, for ignoring its own environmental standards, for making decisions without the input of affected parries or nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and for withholding viral project information from potential critics, such as transnational environmental groups. While the danger of financing unsustainable projects and overlooking environmental standards is obvious, denying access to decision-making and program information also undermines environmental progress. In short, sustainable development depends upon the free flow of information and multiple inputs into decision-making. This article explores whether the GEF can be expected to identify and fund significant environmental projects in conflict-prone regions. It also examines the policies of GEF decision-making, with an emphasis on transparency, accountability, and participation.

AB Economic development is dependant on factors including capital, labour force and natural resources. Forests are natural resources which, if properly managed, can provide habitats for animal and plant species, pasture for livestock, wood for shelter, timber and fuelwood, land for agriculture and can have a favourable effect on weather and climatic patterns. Nevertheless, deforestation has been a widespread phenomenon in tropical Africa, with an annual forest clearance of between 1.3-3.7 million ha. This paper reviews the pattern of deforestation in tropical Africa by examining its causes and consequences, as well as assessing the prospects for the attempts being made to control it. It identifies forest clearance for subsistence farming as the principal determinant of deforestation, but does not consider the ignorance of small-scale farmers as the underlying cause. Given the deteriorating agricultural production, the paper argues that the principal issue is not how to stop forest depletion, but how to manage forest resources to enable the community meets its objectives on an effective, fair and efficient basis. An approach which releases part of the rural population from the land or provides an alternative form of a secure livelihood is an example of the sustainable strategies for managing forests.

AB Tillage and soil management effects on soil physical and chemical qualities were monitored for eight years from 1979 through 1987 in a long-term experiment involving 17 consecutive crops of maize. Effects of no-till and plow-till methods of seedbed preparation were compared at two levels of residue management (residue removed versus residue returned) and two levels of fertilizer application (without fertilizer versus recommended fertilizer). Soil chemical quality was better for no-till compared with plow-till methods. Mean soil chemical properties of 0-5 cm depth for no-till and plow-till treatments respectively were 18.6 g kg(-1) versus 12.2 g kg(-1) for soil organic carbon content, 1.9 g kg(-1) versus 1.1 g kg(-1) for total soil nitrogen, 0.14 units yr(-1) versus 0.18 units yr(-1) rate of decline in soil pH, 63.1 mg kg(-1) versus 31.8 mg kg(-1) for Bray-P, and 6 0 cmol kg(-1) Versus 2.3 cmol kg(-1) for Ca+2. Soil chemical quality consistently declined, although the rate of decline differed among tillage and fertilizer treatments. There were also differences in soil physical quality. Soil bulk density increased with cultivation duration in both tillage methods, and use of furadan in no-till plots drastically increased soil bulk density. Infiltration rate and soil moisture retention at all suctions was consistently more for no-till than plow-till treatments. Decline in soil quality with cultivation was reflected in decrease in crop yields. (C) 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB In situations characterized by true uncertainty and potential irreversibility, the safe minimum standard (SMS) approach is a decision rule to protect some critical natural resource-unless the social costs of doing so are somehow ''intolerable.'' The SMS has been discussed widely, but actual case studies remain rare. We present two case studies, focusing on endangered fishes in rite Colorado and Virgin River systems, demonstrating that the legal framework of the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA) is consistent with the SMS. The case studies incorporate the results from applied general equilibrium modeling and provide an avenue for investigating excessive economic consequences.

DT Article
AB The North and West African coastal and marine areas discussed in this paper consist of the countries from Morocco to Libya for North Africa, and from Morocco to South Africa (up to the Cape of Good Hope) in West Africa. These marine areas consist of a wide to narrow continental shelf, estuaries, lagoons, coastal plains, isolated mountains, mangroves and wetlands. These areas are centres of productive socioeconomic activities with a high population density, vast fisheries, and mineral resources. Presently, these resources are exploited with little attention far the environmental consequences. Sustainable management of the marine environment and its resources requires effective management plans and a human capacity to formulate, implement and monitor these plans. However, most of the countries still lack funds, human and infrastructural capacity for the management of their marine territories and its resources. Though there are many universities, research institutes and private organisations with a modest infrastructure for both data and information handling and the management of the marine environment, the region still lags behind in human and infra-structural capacity. Existing capacity development programmes by United Nations agencies, governments, universities, nongovernmental agencies, have so far not been very effective. A vigorous marine capacity building effort is needed toensure the sustainable management of the marine environment In this African region. Externally funded programmes with a focus ensuring technology cooperation are needed. Such programmes must be based on mutual co-operation and participation of scientists and administrators from the region at all levels of programme formulation, implementation and assessment.

AB By its very nature, meteorology is global and transboundary in scope. The World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) exists, therefore, essentially to facilitate the international coordination, standardisation and maintenance of meteorological observing, data exchange and data-processing facilities, directed ultimately at the provision of meteorological data and services for the benefit of mankind. It does this, inter alia, through providing assistance, as required, in the development of national facilities and human resources to allow every national Meteorological Service to both participate in and benefit from the global systems and programmes. National Meteorological Services have traditionally been concerned with the collection of meteorological and oceanographic data at sea and with the provision of meteorological and related services for the mariner. This involvement has expanded rapidly over the past two decades with expanding utilisation of the oceans and concern for the sustainable management of the marine environment, as well as an increasing realisation of the critical role of the oceans in the global climate system. WMO's efforts to strengthen national Meteorological Services have therefore included an important element of marine capacity building. This paper gives an overview of WMO's technical cooperation and education and training activities in general, before outlining in more detail the requirements for and activities of the Organisation in marine capacity building. These activities are illustrated through three specific case studies, giving three different types of assistance and three different degrees of success. The paper concludes by analysing the reasons for success or failure and drawing lessons from these for the future directions of our work in marine capacity building.

SO MARINE POLICY
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper provides a brief overview of the development of the Global Environment Facility (GEF) since its creation in June 1991 and the nature of its activities in the field of International Waters, Whilst it is recognised that the GEF represents the single largest source of international financial assistance for achieving global environmental benefits its investment in International Waters remains comparatively small, Since the GEF is designed to achieve global environmental benefits through provision of grant and concessionary funding for the agreed incremental costs of projects its primary objective is not capacity building, Nevertheless, the need for capacity building at the individual and institutional levels within projects was recognised early during the initiation of GEF activities. More recently the need for programmatic approaches to capacity building within the GEF has been identified and is being addressed. It is suggested that potentially the role of the GEF in environmental and marine capacity building could be most important at a global, system-wide level, in terms of testing and promoting innovative and novel approaches to issues of environmentally sound and sustainable economic development.

AB In this paper bilateral and multilateral research projects are discussed as particularly attractive means of external assistance to capacity building. The International Indian Ocean Expedition (IIOE; 1959-65) was the first large scale project with a strong component of capacity building, largely due to the farsighted efforts of Dr N.K. Panikkar. Recent examples described in the paper, include multilateral regional research projects in the Middle East and in the Benguela region as well as a bilateral study of the Brazilian mangroves. Combined research and training projects should be of long term nature and have to be based on full partnerships from the early planning through all phases of implementation, up to final publications. Each project should be of direct value for the sustainable development of the host country and the region, it should meet the following criteria: high scientific quality and good prospects for obtaining results of general scientific importance, and if possible, linked to ongoing international programmes in marine science and monitoring. It should be incorporated into the structure of scientific organisations of the host country and linked to other national or regional projects. The universities of the region and their academic teaching programmes should directly benefit from the programme. In the course of the project full use should be made of the data and experience already existing in the region. It should ensure full bilateral data exchange and provide links to international data storage and retrieval systems. Joint publications - preferably in English - in international journals as well as participation in international scientific meetings shall open the entry to the international marine science community.

ID SOILS
AB This paper explores the idea of hybrid knowledge by combining anthropological research with soil science to investigate orthodox assumptions about shifting cultivation among the Wola highlanders of Papua New Guinea. It is commonly assumed that shifting cultivation exhausts soil fertility rapidly, leading to the relocation of settlements and gardens. However in Wolaland, farmers can maintain soil fertility without needing to relocate. Evidence from this research suggests that chemical properties of soil fertility, such as nitrogen, potassium, and organic matter, decline after cultivation, and that phosphorous is always low. Whatever, local soil-management measures allow farmers to cultivate non-perennial crops semi-permanently through incorporating compost from short grassy fallows into 'soil mounds,' with sweet potato as a staple crop. As a result, farmers are able to avoid longterm fallowing, and the Wola have developed sustainable cultivation regimes in land often considered marginal.

TI Post-peasant capitalist graziers: The 21st century in southern Bolivia
SO MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Grazing elements in the household livelihood strategies of rural people in Tarija (southern Bolivia) are examined in order to show how they use a range of micro-environments in a sustainable way, how such strategies have evolved during the present century, and how grazing is intimately linked with out-migration. Grazing strengthens livelihoods and is easily integrated into the survival strategies of people living in what are evidently translocal and transnational communities. Environmental changes associated with these grazing practices are generally positive and degradation is probably less than it was a decade ago. This contradicts the orthodox views held by urban people and agricultural specialists who blame erosion on the current grazing practices rather than on those of the past. Present-day graziers use livestock as a means to accumulate capital in situations of labor scarcity.

TI Sustaining the Andes? Social capital and policies for rural regeneration
   in Bolivia
SO MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIES
AB This paper extends debates about social capital to an analysis of the role of local institutions in establishing environmentally-sustainable development in the Bolivian Andes. Currently, neo-liberal orthodoxies assume an Andean environmental crisis without acknowledging that local adaptation by local inhabitants may reduce exposure to risk, and also enhance economic performance. Conversely alternative development orthodoxy refuses to accept that some regions may indeed be in irreversible decline. The paper questions each of these "orthodoxies". It begins by outlining a framework linking environmental and rural economic regeneration to social capital formation, and then illustrates this in relation to case studies from the departments of Potosi and La Pat. Evidence suggests that local organizations have helped localities negotiate more effectively with state, market, and other civil society actors, as well as provide access to new, cleaner technology, financial resources, and new markets. However, the impact of local institutions in reversing processes of rural decline varies among locations, and for some areas progressive decline and out-migration seem likely. Rural regeneration is only likely to occur in these areas through concerted policy commitment to highland small farm production. This is unlikely in the absence of effective social mobilization at a national level.

ID AGRICULTURAL-RESEARCH
AB The present study proposes a model for the identification of research issues. It includes a set of criteria to weigh the relevance of identified research projects, using an agro-ecological approach by a multidisciplinary team. In this approach, emphasis is placed on the assessment of the impact of the expected results of research projects with regard to productivity and to ecological, economical, and social sustainability. The model comprises seven steps: (1) determination of the main function(s) of a selected agro-ecological zone; (2) determination of the user-needs and indigenous knowledge; (3) determination of the constraints and potentials of the agro-ecological zone; (4) review of existing scientific knowledge and technologies; (5) identification of relevant research issues and their division over strategic and applied research; (6) prioritization and selection of themes and projects; and (7) evaluation of personnel, material and funds. A case study is presented on the sahelian zone of Burkina Faso. Illustration of the model with this degraded area where sustainability is an actual and important issue allows a discussion on the advantages and limitations of this agro-ecological approach for research prioritization.

AB Technologies for Striga control have not been widely adopted because of the mismatch between technologies and farmers' socio-economic conditions. This study uses a participatory rural appraisal technique at the village, household and plot levels to diagnose the extent of the Striga problem in two agro-ecological zones in southern Mall. It has led to the understanding of farmers' attitudes and constraints to Striga control, and opportunities for the development of sustainable technologies suitable for a wide range of farming conditions. Results show that the degree of Striga infestation, levels of farmer knowledge and control practices vary substantially across village territories and fields, and that the severity of the infestation is clearly linked with soil fertility condition and farming practices. It was concluded that in general, the Striga control interventions that would most likely appeal to farmers would be those that will simultaneously improve soil fertility and suppress the development of Striga.

ID CRUSTED SOIL
AB Increasingly, it is being recognized that termites are an important component of agroecosystems, particularly in developing countries where they are an alternative to high priced inputs. Given the major problems in the Sahel of soil crusting and nutrient depletion, this paper shows that termites associated with proper management techniques can play a vital role. Termites contribute to the rehabilitation of crusted soils, i.e. by opening up voids on the sealed surface leading to improved infiltration capacity, and consequently improved water availability. It is recommended, however, that participatory on-farm research should be carried out on how to increase the contribution of termites towards soil management and to reduce the harmful effects.

AB Technical options in crop and animal husbandry to reduce soil nutrient mining and other forms of natural resource degradation in the Sudano-Sahelian zone should be economically attractive, if they are to be adopted. A model is presented in which agronomic and economic information and goals are combined to explore possibilities for agro-ecologically sustainable and economically viable land use in three different climatic regions in Mall and for a situation of non-degraded soils. The time horizon of the study is the year 2010. For each region, an agro-ecologically sustainable land use system (a combination of crop, livestock and pasture production systems) that maximises income of the agricultural sector and satisfies self sufficiency targets is identified. Special attention is given to the use of chemical fertiliser in crop activities. It is shown that use of chemical fertiliser is an important element of sustainable and economically viable land use, especially in higher rainfall regions. It is also concluded that population size has a marked effect on optimal land use systems in the regions, but that self sufficiency is not endangered even if population is 50% higher than estimated for 2010. It is argued that results should not be used to simulate the actual situation or future developments, but to define priorities for agricultural development in the Sudano-Sahelian region.

AB Animal management with different allotment can affect some important soil physical properties on natural pastures, increasing soil susceptibility to water erosion and decreasing its productive capacity. Therefore, more information about the relationships among soil, plant and animal are necessary to improve to sustainability in the use of natural pastures. The experiment was conducted in 1993, with the objctive of evaluating soil aparent density, total porosity, pore diameter distribution, weighed average diameter of aggregates, water infiltration rate on natural pasture submitted to different animal allotments. Four levels of forage supply were studed: 4, 8, 12 and 16%, on soil sandy loam red-yellow podzolic (Paleudult). The results showed a significant decrease on soil water infiltration rate in the lower levels of forage supply (4 and 8%). There was also a trend of decreasing total porosity and weighed average diameter of aggregates and of increasing soil aparent density in treatments with higher grazing pressure and lower forage availability. Calcium and magnesium contents were lower at the first 3 cm of the soil under 4% of forage supply than in the other treatments.

AB Soil microbiological and soil biochemical parameters (pH, exchangeable basic cations, inorganic and organic phosphorus pools, total organic carbon and total nitrogen, microbial biomass carbon, acid and alkaline phosphatase, beta-glucosidase and protease activity) were identified as indicators of soil quality under improved fallow management systems with senna, leucaena and pueraria on severely degraded and non-degraded soil. Principal component analysis demonstrated that soil organic matter related nutrient dynamics was the major contributor to explain the total variance (>80%) of the sites under the prevailing experimental conditions. Highest loadings with the major principal component were provided by microbial biomass, alkaline phosphatase, total N, beta-glucosidase and organic C. Contrasting fallow management systems (alley cropping, live mulch, planted fallow, controls in long-term experiments) at three sites differing in degree of soil degradation could be evaluated adequately by these indicators. beta-Glucosidase indicated soil quality changes better than total organic carbon. Alkaline phosphatase was more sensitive than microbial biomass in characterizing the effects of improved fallow management on site degradation. Acid phosphatase and protease were not considered sensitive indicators for soil quality evaluations of these long-term management trials. Pueraria sustained soil quality on the non-degraded site but did not improve the severely degraded site, suggesting that pueraria is a soil fertility maintenance crop. In contrast, senna improved the degraded sites and more so on the most severely degraded site. Apparently, senna can be considered a suitable candidate for soil restoration purposes.

AB Around the world large tracts of forest, previously available for production, have been reserved for nature conservation. This means that wood supply must be met from a reduced land base, including land of low productivity. In addition there are likely to be increasing demands on the use of managed forests for sequestering C as one means of reducing the build up of atmospheric CO2. One way for the forest industry to meet the demands of increased production would be through the use of fertilizers. Substantially increased growth from fertilizer N application has been measured in many cases while, in the northern hemisphere, atmospheric N deposition has been associated with increased growth in some forests.
   The possibility of using fertilizer N to increase growth, and the effect on the forest and soil, was studied in a research trial area in north-east Tasmania, Australia. Nitrogen was applied for 12 years to a 16 year old P. radiata stand in a low rainfall zone.
   Growth and foliar nutrient concentrations were measured to age 34 years, to determine change after attainment of steady state growth at age 25 years, and following cessation of fertilizing at age 29 years. Biomass sampling was carried out at ages 25 years, 29 years, and 34 years. Growth at the steady peak rate achieved in the fertilizer plots, of 31 m(3) ha(-1) periodic annual increment, was accompanied by changes in the N nutrient pools. Surface applied N built up in the surface litter layer while this layer was increasing, from 15 t ha(-1) to nearly 50 t ha(-1), and fertilizer was being applied between ages 25 and 29 years. Decline of total N in the soil, between ages 25 and 29 years, indicated continued uptake from that source even though fertilizer was being applied. Subsequent increases in soil N, through leaching from the litter layer, followed cessation of fertilizing.
   Following cessation of annual applications of N fertilizer, growth rates declined by less than 15% and remained substantially (>150%) above the control growth rates for 4 years. Over a 3 year period foliar N concentrations declined steadily, to the same as control plots, although mass of needles was not reduced 5 years after cessation of fertilizer applications and remained significantly above that of the control plots.
   Without fertilizers, N for new foliage must be supplied from internal recycling and from mineralization of litter and soil organic matter. There were net losses of N from the foliage and the wood, estimated at around 12 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), for the fertilized trees for the 5 years following cessation of fertilizing. This indicated retention and recycling within the tree of a considerable proportion of the 104 kg N ha(-1) in the foliage, at age 29 years. As rates of mineralization of soil N were likely to be low, this retention of N within the tree was important in maintaining growth rates.
   In the forest ecosystems investigated, with low initial content of soil organic matter and N, fertilizer N produced improved tree health and substantially increased growth, thus providing the opportunity to manage this forest for increased wood production or C sequestration. Although there was a substantial build up of N and C in the litter on the fertilized treatment, incorporation of N and C into the mineral soil was slow, Over 12 years 1.34 t N ha(-1) had been applied, comparable to 40 years of atmospheric deposition at 30 kg N ha(-1). There were no signs of detrimental effects from this application.
   Retention of foliage for a number of years following cessation of fertilizer application and internal recycling of N, which reduced the dependence of the forest stand on continual uptake from the soil, provided the opportunity to use applications of N at periods of two or more years to still promote substantially increased growth. The development of a fertilizing program based on increasing foliar N content by three annual applications of N fertilizer, followed by additional periodic applications at 3 yearly intervals, to maintain foliar N content, is discussed. There are implications of such a program on sustainability and care in selecting sites suitable for such management is advised.

AB In no period of human history has the exercise of perceived individual rights been so extreme, especially in developed countries such as the United States. These perceived rights might have been tolerable in a frontier society (although it is questionable whether the exercise of perceived individual rights to overhunt was tolerated) with vast per capita resources and space, but not on a planet where resources are being fully (or over) utilized, billions are malnourished, and the range from the poorest to the most affluent in material and energy terms is the greatest in human history. Sustainable use of the planet requires some curtailment of individual rights as they are now perceived, not only for the well-being of future generations but for more equitability and fairness at present. In short, sustainability requires a new ethos (a set of guiding beliefs) substantively different from the current practices: (1) an intergenerational equity and fairness in the use of the planet's ecological life support system, (2) an intolerance of the possible high risk associated with human practices that may result from seriously altering the ecological life support system when the consequences of doing so are highly uncertain, and (3) a compassion and esteem for other species and other humans who are now living or yet to live-this should result from tempering often aggressive insistence on individual rights.

AB Carbon emissions from fossil fuel use and other human activity are predicted to cause a significant warming of the global climate, according to a growing consensus of scientists. Global warming would have substantial negative effects on the world environment and economy. Human population and economic growth continue to drive both energy use and carbon emissions. While the developed countries are the largest source of present and past emissions, developing countries are rapidly catching up. China will probably surpass the United States as the largest carbon emitter early in the next century. The global warming treaty signed in Rio in 1992 relies entirely on voluntary emission caps for developed countries and has had little or no apparent effect on emissions. Much stronger steps must be taken to avoid or lessen potential climate change. A globally determined but nationally imposed carbon tax should be adopted to internalize the future costs of carbon emissions into the present cost of fossil fuel and other carbon sources. This would allow the maximum use of free market forces and individual choice to determine how carbon emission reductions are achieved. In addition, national emission caps for all countries should be established. International trade mechanisms can be used to support universal implementation of these measures. Where possible, global warming policy should include strong but equitable incentives for sustainable development and population stabilization, important goals in themselves regardless of the extent of future climate change.

AB Although 'Sustainable Development' is invoked in current political and environmental debates, the concept has eluded precise definition. In general terms, 'sustainability' means working within three sets of constraints: techno-economic, environmental and social. Traditionally, engineering has been concerned with techno-economic issues. Explicit recognition of environmental and social issues has led to the way of thinking called Clean Technology, and to the use of more holistic analytical tools including Life Cycle Assessment. Howeover, it is argued here that a paradigm shift is needed in the way engineering skills and knowledge are used, as inputs to deliberative processes which go beyond techno-economic decisions. The need for this new paradigm is illustrated by the waste management sector, which is increasingly seen as needing the skills of the 'New Model' chemical engineer.

AB Conventional technology used in the treatment of wastewater has been pointed as a major environmental problem for sustainable development, since minimization is not addressed accordingly. Advanced oxidation processes (AOP), based on the formation of hydroxyl radical ((OH)-O-.), a powerful oxidant agent, have been considered to be a potential technology for the destruction of many toxic compounds. Photocatalysis using solar light, an AOP, has been studied for nearly 20 years and recently attracted great interest as a clean-up technology. However, solar detoxification processes have not yet achieved commercial success. This article presents an overview of reaction mechanisms at the surface of semiconductors used as photocatalysts (specially TiO2), when heterogeneous photocatalysis is used to remove hazardous compounds from contaminated sites.

AB The growing consumption of limited reserves of fossil fuels and their impact to the environment have raised global interest in harnessing solar energy. Proper knowledge of solar energy is lacking in many levels of society. Recently, the Energy Research Institute (ERI) of King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology (KACST) have conducted a survey on the availability of solar energy education program around the world. It has been observed that a considerable amount of work has been done for developing solar energy technologies but relatively little attention has been paid on the role of solar energy education. This paper gives an overview of the current status of solar education program available around the globe and it also highlights the importance of the energy information network for solar education program.

AB At the highest altitude, aerobic work is limited by environmental oxygen availability. We therefore reasoned that the hyperpnea associated with endurance training at altitude should provide a strong stimulus for adaptation of the ventilatory muscles. We measured peak inspiratory muscle pressure-flow characteristics (inspiring through graded resistors) and maximum sustainable ventilation capacity in ten permanent residents of La Paz, Bolivia (3600 m) prior to and immediately following 6 weeks of incremental endurance training. Additionally, eight local residents did no training and functioned as controls for the capacity test. While V(O2)max measured in hypoxia increased by 19% (Favier et al., 1995b. J. Appl Physiol. 78, 2286-2393), none of the tested ventilatory variables showed significant changes. The values for the group mean slopes of maximum inspiratory pressure-flow pairs (-10.5 vs. -9.8 cm H2O.sec.L-1, P = 0.301; before versus after training, respectively), maximum inspiratory pressure (112.1 +/- 8.9 vs. 106.9 +/- 8.6 cmH(2)O, P = 0.163), peak inspiratory flow (9.8 +/- 0.41 vs. 10.2 +/- 0.55 L.sec(-1), P = 0.172) and the maximum volitional volume in 12 sec (43.9 +/- 2.4 vs. 45.6 +/- 2.4 L in 12 sec, P = 0.133) were unchanged with exercise training. Likewise, maximal sustainable minute volume was not different between post-training and control subjects (177.4 +/- 7.9 vs. 165.4 +/- 8.4 L.min(-1), P = 0.141). These data support the concept that endurance training fails to elicit functional adaptations in ventilatory muscles in humans, even when exercise is done in hypoxia. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB The real equilibrium exchange rate proposed in this paper is the long run parity which is consistent with the Balassa effect and the sustainability of the external position. Non-price competitiveness factors are also taken into account. Tests are made for three European currencies : mark, franc and lira against dollar. Observed data of real exchange rates are shown to be cointegrated with the fundamentals of the model. The three European currencies are then aggregated according to their weight in the ECU, in order to construct a proxy of the euro. An equilibrium exchange rate of the euro against dollar is calculated and the contributions of the different fundamentals are analysed.

DE small rivers; revitalization; water balance; scenario simulation;

AB Paper shows a necessity of a complex view on the revitalization of small rivers and their catchments. Revitalizing measures should be proposed with respect both to ecological and hydrological aspects, which means to achieve not only a higher ecological stability of a system but also to guarantee sustainable and acceptable hydrological (rainfall - runoff) conditions on a catchment and in its river bed. It has been shown the effect of land use on the main components of water balance in the Srbicky catchment (district Domazlice). As the tool in analysis and in subsequent simulation of changes in land use the hydrological model WBCM (Water Balance Conceptual Model) has been applied. This model can simulate a water balance quite well when runoff data or data on ground water tables fluctuation are available. Unfortunately, in this study the outlet of Srbicky; catchment is ungauged (as usually many small catchments are not measured), thus three basic model parameters were adjusted according to the existing soil date and due to topographical and other data. Model WBCM (version 4) has been further implemented in a simulation of hypothetical scenarios representing changes in grassland (including pastures) with an aim to quantify the extent of influence of surface runoff and of subsurface recharge. This simulation has given an evidence that the change of 10% can significantly affect the subsurface water recharge (by infiltration) to 17% (plus, minus). This influence has been computed in average year. In dry year it is still more significant. The trends in changes of surface runoff are even more considerable.

AB The term "sustainable development" is a prophetic combination of two words which unites both aspects-economic progress and environmental quality-in one vision. The attractiveness of such a term has its price, however. It can become an empty phrase if it is not clearly defined and conceptualized. What is needed is a description of the concept that is exact as possible, and details on how to operationalize it. Such a definition should allow for flexibility, but not arbitrariness, in implementing the concept. The project of the Center of Technology Assessment in Baden-Wurttemberg with the title "Qualitative Growth as Prerequisite for Sustainable Development in Baden-Wurttemberg" is an attempt to accomplish this. The aim of the project is to develop a concept of sustainable development on a regional scale by developing general guidelines and conversion strategies for the various players involved.

AB The future outlook of biofuels is beset by uncertainty. Key factors for the adoption of biofuels as alternative technologies are policy decisions by governments in terms of regulations, such as government procurement schemes and fuel specifications, along with financial and economic instruments, such as subsidies and preferential taxation. In this framework, the present analysis is a prospective as to the future development of a biofuel program in the European Union and the hypothetical role of developing countries as suppliers in this new market. The focus of this article is, exclusively, on liquid fuels. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Inc.

AB This article deals with the environmental effects of the production and consumption of plastics. The original study was carried out at the request of the National Environmental Conference (Landelijk Milien Overleg) of the Netherlands as part of a project on sustainable chemical production. This project was sponsored by The Netherlands Department of the Environment. In the project, various studies were commissioned on the environmental performance of specific branches of chemical production. The purpose of these studies was to provide a basis for a comprehensive vision on the future of the production of chemicals, and for discussions with the chemical industry. The article will first deal with the history of plastics and then analyze current plastic production, plastic industry, and plastic consumption. The environmental burden caused by plastics is analyzed, as are the various measures taken to reduce this burden. Their effects are analyzed. This article also examines the political debates and conflicts of interest that are involved. In its conclusions, the article will discusses the possible form of a sustainable plastics industry.

AB A nationwide Delphi-based technology forecasting exercise was undertaken in India in electronics and information technology. First, scenario writings covering 10 subtechnological areas were done by a panel of experts based on certain guidelines provided by the Technology, Information, Forecasting & Assessment Council (TIFAC). These formed the basis of framing of more than 280 Delphi questions by a set of experts. Delphi inquiry required responses to be given in numerical as well as text form particularly to cover specific Indian scenario and needs. About 370 experts were asked to respond. The response rate was around 35%, which was considered statistically sufficient to go ahead with the analysis. A computer program analyzed the responses through the combination of interquartile range mean, median, and mode to find out the consensus among the respondents on a particular question. Text-based responses were analyzed to propose a roadmap for India. Technology forecasts, thus done on short, medium, and longterm, were then fine tuned in a one-day seminar of experts, planners, and administrators. These were then debated and short listed to arrive at a recommended plan of action for implementation. The modified Delphi methodology for technology forecasting proposed in this article is thus a combination of scenario writing, Delphi questionnaire, and response analysis using additional written inputs to develop a roadmap for India, fine tuning and short listing through a seminar for implementation. This methodology is considered unique for rapidly changing technology with all pervasive applications like electronics and information technology aiming at sustainable development.

AB We have identified, isolated, and characterized microsatellite/simple sequence repeat (SSR) loci in trembling aspen (Populus tremuloines) by screening partial genomic libraries. We have also examined the compatibility and use of the P. tremuloides SSR primers to resolve microsatellites in other Populus species. Fourteen microsatellites were identified from 1600 clones screened. The TC/AG microsatellites were the most abundant. A total of 29 alleles were detected in 36 P. tremuloides individuals at the four SSR loci (two each of di-and tri-nucleotide repeats) characterized. The number of alleles at the SSR loci ranged from 5 to 11, with an average of 7.25 alleles per locus, and the observed heterozygosity ranged from 0.19 to 0.82, with a mean of 0.46 per locus. Although the highest polymorphism was observed for a dinucleotide SSR locus, the trinucleotide SSR loci showed substantial polymorphism. There were 34 unique multilocus genotypes among the 36 P. tremuloides individuals examined, and 89% of the individuals had unique multilocus genotypes. Two pairs of SSR primers were successful in PCR, amplifying genomic DNA and resolving microsatellites of comparable size from Populus deltoides, P. nigra, P. x canadensis, and P. maximowiczii. The microsatellite DNA markers developed could be used for clonal fingerprinting, certification of controlled crosses, genome mapping, marker-assisted early selection, genetic diversity assessments, and conservation and sustainable management of poplar genetic resources.

ID THIRD-WORLD CITIES
AB For the management of a city to be successful, its policies need to be conducive to 'social sustainability'. This is defined as development compatible with the emergence of a social contract, one that fosters an environment that will help harmonise relations between the city's culturally and socially diverse groups and encourage social integration and an improvement in the lives of all its citizens. These issues are discussed particularly in the light of recent experience in four capital cities in South-east Asia: Jakarta, Bangkok, Manila and Kuala Lumpur.

TI Sustaining the unsustainable? City and society in Indonesia
SO THIRD WORLD PLANNING REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
ID THIRD-WORLD CITIES; URBAN-DEVELOPMENT; FORCES
AB The peoples of South-east Asia are responding very actively, and sometimes quite constructively, to the exigencies created by social, economic and environmental pressures and threats, but not necessarily in a manner that is conducive to sustainable development in the longer term. Using the particular case of Ujung Pandang, Indonesia, this paper develops the central contention that the preoccupation of many people with survivalism is both a consequence of the nature of development and also a significant impediment to sustainable urban development.

TI Sustained growth but non-sustainable urbanisation in Penang, Malaysia
SO THIRD WORLD PLANNING REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
AB Foreign capital, particularly from the transnational electronics industries, has spurred urban growth in Penang, Malaysia. But the demand for labour-quantitative and qualitative-exceeds its supply from the northern states. Local and national labour policies are decided without the involvement of trade unions, which lack the strength to substantially improve wages or influence the institutions of the labour market. So a frenzied labour market tries to balance the upgrading of skills and the control of wages. The paper concludes that a focus on sustainable urbanisation will renew the debate on urban, export-oriented industrialisation in South-east Asia.

TI The sustainability of urban development in the SIJORI Growth Triangle -
   A social perspective
SO THIRD WORLD PLANNING REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
ID THIRD-WORLD CITIES; LABOR; STATE; ASIA
AB This paper discusses urban development in the SIJORI Growth Triangle and its economic basis. It then considers its sustainability and social dimension. The prospects for sustainability depend on how economic and social change affects, and is affected by, changing labour market structures, the characteristics of labour, labour organisation and their impacts on social relations. Urban development in and beyond this context does not yet appear to be socially sustainable. A positive dynamic in the relations between urban economic base, labour market development and labour characteristics is necessary, as are the relations between the different aspects (economic, social and political) of sustainability.

AB In spruce and beech stands, mineral budgets for a rotation period were calculated from measured element fluxes. The release of base cations by mineral weathering was calculated with the steady state soil chemistry model PROFILE. The calcium release rate by weathering of the mineral fine earth was extremely low. For the period of one rotation, mineral weathering cannot provide enough Ca to compensate timber harvesting and leaching. Forest sustainability depends strongly on the amounts of Ca gained from deposition and lost by biomass removal. Magnesium was supplied by atmospheric deposition and mineral weathering. Calculated weathering rates were close to present soil losses. However, as the model assumes that all dissolution reactions are congruent, the computed release rate of Mg from illite might be too high. Main inputs of K to the soil solutions were primarily attributed to canopy leaching and litterfall in upper horizons and to mineral weathering in deeper horizons. The cation budget of the beech stand was much more equilibrated than that of the spruce stand. Given possible changes in silviculture and deposition chemistry, the sustainability of the present stands is rather improbable with respect to their mineral supply.

AB The current GATT agreement will further reduce trade barriers around the world, leading to a market situation where only the fittest, in production terms 'leanest', can survive. Time-to-market is becoming critical for the success of enterprises. Enterprises can survive by cooperating with others forming a 'virtual enterprise'. Virtual enterprises are capable of reducing time-to-market by applying concurrent engineering methodologies in a globally distributed environment, and by production adaptation to specific customer needs. Increased dependency and topographical distribution of the business partners require detailed planning of the production and logistics process. Where the internal production logistics are usually well optimised, the new situation requires external production logistics also to be optimised to suit the requirements arising from the new production scheme. Beside this business-related production changes, the public will have an increased impact on the different production paradigms in the future. Sustainable production set-ups are required to satisfy the requirements of people living at the border of production facilities. The LOCOMOTIVE consortium is developing a tool that will help create a logistic infrastructure suitable for tackling the new challenging logistics demands of the emerging production paradigm, including the assessment of environmental impacts. The tool is intended to be used by middle and upper management, to support the search for appropriate logistic solutions at the strategic decision level. (C) 1998 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

AB In spite of increased food production in the country due to green revolution, current levels of production cannot be sustained to meet the growing needs of the country. This is because of concurrent degradation of environment in terms of salinity, water-logging, soil erosion and air as well as water pollution, etc. How do we maximize productivity to meet the food needs of the country without deteriorating the environment? This is a challenging task and it requires altogether a different approach in the very basic methodology of agricultural research. We discuss this approach-an approach based on dialectical principles. A dialectical perspective as against the hitherto practised reductionist approach, is presented in relation to sustainability in agricultural production with several illustrative examples.

AB THE ISSUE OF MANDATORY CONTINUING MEDICAL EDUCATION (CME) is controversial. Traditional measures mandate only attendance, not learning, and have no measurable performance end points. There is no evidence that current approaches to CME, mandatory or voluntary, produce sustainable changes in physician practices or application of current knowledge. Ongoing educational development is an important value in a professional, and there is an ethical obligation to keep up to date. Man dating self audit of the effect of individual learning on physician's practices and evaluation by the licensing authority are effective ways of ensuring the public are protected. The author recommends the use of a personal portfolio to document sources of learning, the effect of learning and the auditing of their applications on practice patterns and patient outcomes. A series of principles are proposed to govern its application.

ID LOCAL COMMONS
AB Financial resource needed for sustainable rural drinking water is estimated from expenditure data for oil states in India. The estimates show that user financing becomes essential for sustainability of the system. Since user financing affects weaker sections adversely, a subsidy from consumers above poverty line to those below is incorporated in the tariff design along the Faulhaberian principles. The rate so arrived at, indicates that public subsidy is still needed for some states with high cost of provision due to their hydro-geological and topographical conditions and/or cost inefficiency. Analysis of institutions based on co-operative action among users suggests that they have several advantages over the other polar alternatives, state ownership and privatisation, in providing potable water. Participatory management inherent in such institutions also enables the government to change its role from provider to facilitator.

SO AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS

ID FOOD-PRODUCTION; UNITED-STATES; COST
AB A combination of process and I-O analyses is used to investigate relationships between several kinds of energy uses, product compositions and technical change in Swedish agriculture. Estimates are based on comparisons of three development stages in the transition period from 1956 to 1993, Energy productivity has changed dramatically. Cash crops and non-ruminant animals have been more efficient in their use of support energy, compared to other farm sectors; all sectors have increased their solar energy productivity, Support energy from fertilisers is increasingly a major contributor to solar energy productivity giving 20 kWh biomass per kWh input. Manure has become marginal as a substitute fbr external energy inputs through fertiliser. Transforming a larger population of produced biomass to useful products outside agriculture, changing from ruminants to non-ruminants production or finding fuel uses of manure will increase energy, productivity and sustainability. Contradictions with recent analyses of energy or sustainability may be explained by differences in the perceived influences of technical and structural change or earlier incomplete systems approaches.

AB In semiarid West Africa, inorganic fertilizer use and sustainability objectives are complementary, With increasing population pressure and low levels of purchased inputs, crop yields in many regions are declining. Moderate use of inorganic fertilizer is required for increasing yields in a sustainable way. Where infiltration is a problem, a water-retention technique reduces the risk and increases the returns from fertilization. In the sandy dune soils, fertilization and higher densities are sufficient to raise farm incomes at acceptable risk levels. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The efficiency of on-going delivery systems and cost recovery in Mectizan (ivermectin, MSD) treatment for onchocerciasis are reviewed. The search is on for an effective system of Mectizan delivery, involving drug procurement, delivery from port to districts and distribution to eligible persons, which can be sustained by the endemic countries for many years. The mechanisms for procuring and clearing the drugs at the ports, and the drug's integration into the existing delivery systems of each national health service, need to be improved. Although large-scale treatments by mobile teams or community-based methods evidently achieve high and satisfactory rates of coverage, they also incur high recurrent costs which have to be covered by external partners and are not sustainable by national health services. Cost-sharing is considered an important factor in a sustainable delivery system and community-directed treatment, in which the community shares the cost and ownership of local distribution and is empowered to design and implement it, is likely to be more cost-effective and sustainable.

AB This note overviews several studies that have been conducted on the economic impact of onchocerciasis (river blindness) control through the African Programme for Onchocerciasis Control (APOC). A cost-benefit analysis of the APOC concludes that the programme is highly cost-effective. The economic rate of return (ERR) is 17% if benefits are considered in accordance with the stated objective of the programme (i.e. the achievement of long-term, sustainable, ivermectin-delivery systems). However, the cost-benefit analysis significantly under-estimates the net benefits from the APOC, since it considers, for ease of quantification, only the reduction in blindness as the principal benefit accruing from control activities. Recent studies, summarized here, have shown that there may be substantial benefits tin terms of enhanced productivity, increased household-level welfare, and reduced health-related expenditure, for instance) resulting from the reduction of the skin-related symptoms associated with the disease.

TI Regulating meaning, appropriating nature: The codification of California
   organic agriculture
SO ANTIPODE
LA English
DT Article
ID TRANSITION
AB In California, conventional agro-food firms are beginning to appropriate the most lucrative aspects of organic food provision and to abandon the agronomic and marketing practices associated with organic agriculture's oppositional origins. Echoing the uneasy and complex dialectic between nature and capital in the American West, organic farming is becoming more akin to farming off of nature's image, as the idiom of a "purer" nature is deployed to sell what is increasingly commodified nature. The direction of organic agriculture in California can be understood as reflecting global trends in agro-food provision and regulation, but it is also uniquely grounded in the context of California's regional history: on the one hand, a product of the counterculture, bolstered by a strong climate of environmental regulation; on the other hand, a legacy of California's exceptional agriculture, characterized in part by the dominance of growers' organizations and a focus on high-value specialty crops. This paper also discusses three ways in which the political construction of the meaning of "organic" and its institutionalization in regulatory agencies such as private certification organizations have facilitated both the proliferation of agribusiness entrants and their adoption of questionably sustainable practices: first, certification agencies have their own institutional logic and are most beholden to their client-growers; second, regulation requires the definition of enforceable standards out of complicated ecological, economic, and even sociocultural concerns; third, the certification process, by conferring a legal right to market food as organic, has created distinct incentives that shape participation in the sector.

ID MOUNT-ISA; AUSTRALIA; METAMORPHISM; DEFORMATION; AGE
AB Zircon geochronology-using U-Pb SHRIMP methods-has been applied to investigate the Palaeoproterozoic history of basin development and sedimentation in the western Mt Isa Inlier and eastern McArthur Basin. Ages of the sediment packages have been measured using the abundant felsic volcanics in lower parts of the sequences, and overlying sediments have been dated through the use of zircons in sparse, concordant tuff beds that punctuate these successions.
   The earliest volcanic phases north and south of the Murphy Inlier are close to 1725 Ma, and may be part of a much larger extensional tectonic regime now identified in the central and eastern Mt Isa Inlier. A somewhat younger episode of volcanism took place in the central Lawn Hill Platform (Fiery Creek Volcanics and Bigie Formation) at about 1710 Ma, approximately coeval with volcanism throughout much of the McArthur Basin. The most southerly volcanic suite below the Mt isa Group is 30-40 million years younger, closer to the ca 1650 Ma age of overlying strata and suggesting a rather complex pattern of basin evolution. There is evidence that the present concept of discrete cover sequences over the entire Mt Isa Inlier may no longer be sustainable.
   SHRIMP U-Pb zircon results for the McNamara/Mt Isa Groups which host syngenetic or late diagenetic Pb-Zn-Ag mineralisation constrain the time(s) of deposition of associated stratabound ores. For the Mt Isa and Hilton orebodies, the depositional ages are 1652 +/- 7 Ma and 1654 +/- 5 Ma, confirming correlation to the lower McNamara Group which contains tuff interbeds dated at 1653 +/- 7 Ma. The turbiditic facies of the upper McNamara Group is at least 20 million years younger than this. The deeper water basin phase represented by the Lawn Hill Formation in the uppermost McNamara Group is younger (1595 +/- 6 Ma) and has no analogue in the exposed Mi Isa Group.
   The new results provide a good time connection between parts of the Fickling and McArthur Groups that host the Walford Creek and McArthur Pb-Zn deposits. Tuffs in these host sequences have U-Pb zircon ages of 1640 +/- 7 Ma and 1639 +/- 3 Ma, respectively. Thus, deposition of the predominantly shallow-water sediments was approximately synchronous across both the Mt Isa and McArthur regions in the interval 1655-1640 Ma.

AB Namibia is an arid country but has a diverse array of wetland habitats ranging from ephemeral water bodies and rain-pools, artesian springs supporting small perennial pools and streams, to the large perennial rivers of thr: north-east with their associated floodplains. These rivers drain welter areas north of Namibia and contribute many tropical species to Namibia's wetlands. There are 778 described species of macro-invertebrates representing eight phyla with 81 endemics. Many invertebrates still have to be identified or described but presently the greatest endemism occurs among the Ostracoda(18 species:), Coleoptera (17), Diptera (14), Anostraca (six) and Amphipoda (five species). In total, Namibia has 50 species of frog with three endemics. No caecilians or salamanders occur in Namibia. There are 114 species of freshwater fish with five endemics. Most Namibian wetlands occur outside protected areas. Over-exploitation of wetland resources and flow regulation are currently major threats, but new environmental legislation being formulated is based on the goal of sustainable use.

TI Extending the Namibian protected area network to safeguard hotspots of
   endemism and diversity
SO BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
LA English
DT Article
DE protected area network; conservation history; endemism; conservancy;
   biosphere reserve
AB Namibia's state protected area network (PAN) covers 13.8% of the country's land area, but is seriously inadequate;Is a basis for effective biodiversity conservation. The early parks system was not designed with biological diversity in mind, and reflects instead a history of ideological, economic and veterinary considerations. Currently, parks in the Namib Desert biome make up 69% of the PAN, while savanna and woodland biomes are somewhat underrepresented (7.5 and 8.4% of their respective land areas), and the Karoo biome is badly underrepresented (1.6%). Four of 14 desert vegetation types are comprehensively protected, with 67 to 94% representation in the PAN, yet six savanna types have 0 to 2% representation by area. Mountain Savanna, a vegetation type unique to Namibia, is wholly unprotected. The status of two marine reserves, which in theory protect only 0.01% of Namibia's marine environment, needs clarification and augmentation with new reserves. Nearly 85% of Namibia's land is zoned for agriculture, so effective biodiversity protection means working outside the PAN to improve the sustainability and diversity of farming practices. Wildlife conservancies on commercial and communal farmlands show excellent potential to mitigate the ecological skew in the state PAN, with the ecological management of large areas being decentralized to rural communities in habitats otherwise neglected for conservation. Two important endemism zones, the Kaoko escarpment and coastal plain and the Sperrgebiet succulent steppe, plus the species-rich Caprivi area, offer three valuable opportunities for regional consolidation of protected areas into transboundary 'peace parks' or biosphere reserves.

TI Impacts of density-dependent growth and maturation on assessment advice
   to rebuild depleted US silver hake (Merluccius bilinearis) stocks
SO CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
ID LIFE-HISTORY; FISHERIES; SUCCESS; LARVAE; TIME; SIZE; RISK
AB We examined how density-dependent growth and maturation rates would affect scientific advice to rebuild U.S. silver bake (Merluccius bilinearis) stocks to a minimum biomass threshold (SSB50) using an age-structured stochastic projection model. Uncertainty in recruitment and initial stock sizes at age was incorporated to more realistically capture the stochastic nature of the stock's dynamics through time. Performance measures including spawning stock biomass (SSBt)(t) risk (prob(SSBt< SSB50)), and fishery yields were examined under model assumptions of static life history parameters in contrast with density-dependent parameters for various constant fishing mortality rate (F) harvest policies. Model results indicated that unless compensatory mechanisms are accounted for, scientific advice may be too optimistic and lead to unrealistic expectations of F targets to achieve stock rebuilding, requiring longer rebuilding times and entailing more risk and unrealized sustainable yield. For instance, projected median southern stock SSB, exceeded the SSB50 of 104 000 metric tons (t) with 40% risk to the stock by year 20 from harvesting at F = 0.50. However, under the density-dependent assumption, median SSB, did not rebuild as expected, and after 20 years reached only 75 000 t with 85% risk to the stock. Also under this assumption, median yields increased from 9000 to 27 000 t by year 20 but were 30-40% lower than what would have been expected under density independence.

TI Reevaluation of row spacing plant density of seeded pasture grasses for
   the semiarid prairie
SO CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PLANT SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
DE forage yield; forage quality; leaf : stem ratio; plot technique
AB Previous research in the semiarid prairie at Swift Current, Saskatchewan, indicated that optimum row spacing for forage production was 60 or 90 cm for crested wheatgrass (Agropyron cristatum [L.] Gaertner) and Russian wild ryegrass (Psathyrostachys juncea [Fisch.] Nevski). However, recent research suggested that harvest method affects forage yield estimates from row spacing experiments. An experiment with three row spacings of mixtures of alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) with crested wheatgrass and Russian wild ryegrass was harvested mechanically and by hand. Yield differences between methods of harvesting were affected by row spacing; larger differences were observed at 15 cm than at 60 cm spacing, particularly for Russian wild ryegrass. The highest hand-harvested forage yield estimates were observed in the narrowest row spacing. In a second experiment, plant density was evaluated for the same grasses using square grid spacings of 30, 45, 60, 75 and 90 cm. Decreasing plant density was associated with decreased hand-harvested forage yield in both species. In a third experiment, 60- and 90-cm row spacing resulted in more seed heads and lower leaf content than 30-cm row spacing. Leaf digestibility increased slightly with increased row spacing. These results suggest that 30-cm row spacing should be recommended to producers for sustainable pastures in the semiarid prairie region.

TI Liability for oil spill damages: Issues, methods, and examples
SO COASTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE oil spills; economic damages; liability
AB Liability is art important incentive-based instrument for preventing oil spills and provides a sustainable approach for restoring coastal resources injured by spills. However, the use of liability for environmental damages raises many challenges, including quantification of money measures of damages. In this article, case studies are used to illustrate the issues, methods, and challenges associated with assessing a range of damages, from those that can be measured relatively easily using market information to more "esoteric," and much more difficult, cases involving non-marker-valued losses. Also discussed are issues raised by the new national and international regulatory focus on restoration and by the simplified, compensatory formula used by some states.

AB The Bay Islands of Honduras are surrounded by one of the world's most magnificent coral reefs. However, the reef communities have suffered greatly due to human activities on the islands. Even though permit regulations and agencies have been established since 1991, degradation of the environment continues because of the lack of technical expertise in environmental evaluations of projects, inconsistency in enforcement of the regulations, lack of community participation, and the weakness of the environmental legislation. This is the first evaluation of the effectiveness of coastal regulations for development projects and of the associated environmental impacts on the Bay Islands covering the period from 1992 to 1995. The results indicate that although compliance to the regulations increased, the number and severity of the environmental impacts also increased. A $27 million loan from the Inter-American Development Bank to prepare a Program for the Environmental Management of the Bay Islands is designed to maintain the quality of the environment, with an emphasis on coastal resources and sustainable uses of these resources. With appropriate planning, combined with community participation, adequately trained staff and sufficient budgets, the Bay Islands could become the western Caribbean model for well-planned, economically viable development that maintains environmental integrity and responds to the sociopolitical context of the islands.

TI The impacts of cable snare hunting on wildlife populations in the

SO CONSERVATION BIOLOGY

ID RAIN-FOREST; CALLIPYGUS; DORSALIS
AB Cable snares are probably the most widespread hunting method used in central African forests today. I evaluated the impacts of cable snare hunting on wildlife in the Central African Republic. I accompanied 17 snare hunters to hunting camps to check snare lines. I identified and weighed all animals captured, recorded losses to decomposition and scavengers, and identified escaped animals when possible. Data from observed hunting activities were extrapolated to estimate the animal rate of hunting offtake from snares within the Bayanga snare hunting range of 1000 km(2). All mammals, as well as several birds and reptiles, were captured in cable snares. But 75% of snare captures were of four species: the three duikers (Cephalophus callipygus, C. dorsalis, and C. monticola) and the brush-tailed porcupine (Atherurus africanus). Losses to scavengers and decomposition amounted to 27% of total captures. Over one-third of animals caught by cable snares broke the cable and escaped with an injury. Protected species represent 2% of animals caught by snares. Population densities for the three duiker species and the brush-tailed porcupine were estimated from line-transect surveys and net-hunt encounters. Additional density estimates from research sites elsewhere in central Africa were taken from the literature, as were figures on reproductive productivity. The wide range of estimates for population densities, reproductive productivity, and sustainable offtake rates make the sustainability of snare hunting difficult to assess; however, snare hunting is probably unsustainable for the three duiker species.

AB Gross domestic product (GDP) is widely acknowledged to be a poor measure of social well-being. This paper surveys several substitutes for and modifications of GDP which have been offered as measures of society's welfare. The Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare, a measure endorsed by many ecological economists, is found to possess a variety of virtues - but also several imperfections. The search for a social welfare measure has not yet ended. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

ID PEOPLES
AB This article outlines the ethnobotanical and economic importance of the monkey-puzzle tree (Araucaria araucana), a long-lived conifer endemic to the temperate forests of Chile and Argentina. It also assesses the connection between indigenous resource rights and environmental conservation by examining the history of the tree's use in Ralco Lepoy, an indigenous community of 800 inhabitants located in the Andes of southern Chile. Primary data,were collected through interviews and field observations. Secondary data were collected through archival research in national and provincial capitals. Self-determination and territorial rights are important factors in the indigenous interest in and commitment to the conservation of the monkey-puzzle tree. A complementary approach to indigenous land rights and environmental protection may be an appropriate strategy to decentralize conservation efforts and ensure local participation in developing sustainable resource management plans.

AB This study examines the predictivity, sustainability, and management of tagua nuts from the palm Phytelephas aequatorialis under three management regimes in northwestern Ecuador. Tagua nuts are used internationally as an ivory substitute and the palm fronds are used locally as roof thatch. Plots were established in control site nad in three local management regimes: pure tagua groves; stands with tagua and cacao in an agroforestry system; and tagua groves where the undergrowth is cleared and old fronds removed. Data were collected for one year and local extractors were interviewed about their tagua management. Palm demography indicates heavy management with few subadult individuals and many more adult females than males. Productivity analyses do not demonstrate the influence of any ne environmental variable on leaf or infructescence productivity. The pure tagua grove is the management regime most conducive to tagua sustainability. The sustainability results are underscored by the extractive methodology, where local extractors maximize tagua collected while minimizing collection time. These results are incorporated into management recommendations to foster tagua extraction while ensuring its sustainability and future use.

TI Contradictions of capitalist industrialization in East Asia: A critique
   of "flying geese" theories of development
SO ECONOMIC GEOGRAPHY
LA English
DT Article
DE East Asia; industrialization; flying geese; exploitation
ID PATTERN; JAPAN
AB According to most development economists, the economic "miracle" of the ASEAN-3, following the earlier experiences of Japan and the Asian NIEs, demonstrates the benefits of export-led growth. This conclusion is shared by neoliberals and structural-institutionalists, despite disagreements over the role of state intervention. Both views are represented in increasingly influential "flying geese" theories, which credit regional economic dynamics, in particular those shaped by Japanese foreign direct investment, for the regional advance. Our critique of this perspective starts by showing how the successive waves of Japanese foreign direct investment represented responses by Japanese capital to the class-based and competitive contradictions of Japan's accumulation process. The recent expansion of NIE-based foreign direct investment in the ASEAN-5 is likewise a response to the contradictions of export-led growth, although in the NIEs' case these contradictions were accentuated by economic dependency on Japanese capital. Contrary to celebratory flying geese perspectives, we find that this hierarchical regionalization of investment and production, and resulting intensification of competitiveness pressures, does not offer sustainable improvements in work and living conditions in Japan, the NIEs, or the ASEAN-3. However, by creating a more regionalized class structure in which core, semiperipheral, and peripheral area workers are subjected to a common set of competitiveness pressures, East Asian industrialization creates the potential for a regionalization and strengthening of worker/community resistance to capitalism.

ID INFRASTRUCTURE
AB Mitigating global climate change will require a profound transformation of energy use sectors throughout the world and this challenge is particularly acute for the United States transportation sector. Market forces alone are unlikely to change transportation-energy technologies and infrastructures sufficiently to address the needs for an environmentally sustainable system. A set of policies for encouraging technological advances and promoting sustainable planning, operations, and pricing of transportation services was analysed for its effects on sector energy use and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Baseline projections show US transport sector GHG emissions increasing over the 1990 level 28% by 2010 and 58% by 2030. The combined impacts of the policies analysed would be substantial emission reductions that grow over time, with GHG emissions returned to the 1990 level by 2010 and cut to 35% lower by 2030. Due to fuel savings from technology-based efficiency improvements, it was found that the economic benefits accruing from these reductions would outpace costs almost from the outset.

AB The global context for regional policy is changing fast. Regional policy is challenged by the globalisation and regionalisation of political and economic structures, the implementation of sustainable development, and the reform of political and administrative structures. Most European countries have started to reformulate their regional policy. This wave of change has touched Switzerland as well. Although disparities between the regions are not of the same magnitude as in other countries, regional development problems can be found all over Switzerland. Regional policy, however, has not been adapted to tackle the present challenges. Evaluations in Switzerland and experiences in other countries reveal a need for a more integrated regional policy approach. With reference to the Swiss context, the authors outline the form an integrated policy approach could take. The approach includes the political system and sectoral policies with regional impact and comprises six elements: public and private actors; institutional structures and processes; top-down and bottom-up approaches; exogenous and endogenous strategies; economic, social, and environmental dimensions; and policies at regional, national, and European levels. This integrated perspective is complemented with considerations of how this approach in practice could look like on the national and the regional level. Special attention is given to the role of regional actors and institutions in the development process.

AB The idea of measuring the national welfare level by using the green NNP (net national product) has gained much attention lately This paper summarizes the research on social accounting in imperfect market economies by putting the results into a unified framework. The main contribution of the paper is to relate the form of the national welfare measure to the functioning of the economic system and, therefore, to explicitly address the informational requirements implicit in social accounting.

AB This paper analyses some of the most important spillovers of recent developments of economic theory into environmental economics. Attention is given to the anlaysis of sustainable economic development paths, where endogenous growth models are used; the implications of environmental dumping and more generally of policies concerning global environmental issues, where new trade theories are very useful; and, the effectiveness of environmental policy instruments when markets are imperfectly competitive, where industrial organisation theory is employed. The paper does not only note recent developments in environmental economics, but also relates these to the previous environmental economics literature. Thus, it can be assessed whether new results actually improve our knowledge of crucial economic and environmental issues.

AB Revisions to the European Treaty of Union require some form of environmental appraisal - primarily risk assessment and cost-benefit analysis - of regulatory initiatives by the European Commission. A retrospective look at the emergence of environmental appraisal also shows that, while the Commission has made great advances in introducing cost-benefit or cost-effectiveness appraisals in recent years, past environmental decisions and overall environmental policy have not been informed by systematic appraisal techniques. Nor is it clear what role is now being played by risk assessments. While it is impossible to gauge the extent to which systematic appraisal procedures will save on regulatory and compliance expenditures, some indications are provided of the costs of past neglect of these procedures.

AB The ecological concept of resilience has begun to inform analysis of change in economy-environment systems. The linkages between resilience and the stability of dynamical systems are discussed, along with its role in understanding of the evolution of such systems. Particular linkages discussed include those between resilience, biodiversity and the sustainability of alternative states. Recent developments in modelling the resilience of joint economy-environment systems suggest the advantages of analysing change in the system as a Markov process, the transition probabilities between states offering a natural measure of the resilience of the system in such states. It is argued that this 'emergent property' of the collaboration between ecology and economics has far-reaching implications for the way we think about, model and manage the environmental sustainability of economic development.

AB Academic and policy debates over climate change risks and policies have stimulated economic research in a variety of fields. in this article I briefly discuss eight overlapping areas of current research in which further effort is particularly warranted. These areas include decision criteria for policy; risk assessment and adaptation; uncertainty and learning; abatement cost and the innovation and diffusion of technology; and the credibility of policies and international agreements. Further analysis in these areas not only will advance academic understanding but also will provide insights of considerable importance to policymakers.

TI Estimated tuna discard from dolphin, school, and log sets in the eastern
   tropical Pacific Ocean, 1989-1992
SO FISHERY BULLETIN
LA English
DT Article
AB Pressure to reduce fishery-related dolphin mortality in the tuna purse-seine fishery of the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean (ETP) may alter fishing patterns from the current situation, in which most tuna is caught in association with dolphins, to a situation in which these "dolphin sets" are replaced by sets on unassociated schools of tuna (school sets) or on floating objects (log sets). Although not likely to effect any substantial change in dolphin population dynamics, owing to current low levels of dolphin mortality, such a change in fishing pattern could damage the commercial stock of yellowfin tuna and perhaps stocks of other tuna species because, unlike dolphin sets which generate almost no unwanted catch, school and log sets capture moderate to large amounts of undersized or otherwise undesirable tuna that are subsequently discarded at sea.
   In this study, we examined the differences between set types (in short tons of tuna discarded per set by U.S. vessels fishing in the ETP during 1989-92) and then predicted the increase in short tons of tuna discarded per set (all tuna species combined) that would likely result from replacing the dolphin sets with an equivalent number of school or log sets (or both).
   Expected discard weight of tuna was 100 times higher for log sets and 10 times higher for school sets than for dolphin sets. Average expected tuna discard per set was 0.06 short tons for dolphin sets, 1.15 short tons for school sets, and 10.5 short tons for log sets. Hypothetically, redistributing all dolphin sets to log sets increased estimated average discard of tuna by the international fleet in the ETP by about 337%.
   A hypothetical replacement of all dolphin sets with log sets would lead to estimated discards of 10-25% of the estimated average number of yellowfin recruits to the fishery each year. If this discard is combined with an estimated 25% reduction in tons of yellowfin tuna caught that would result from concommitant changes in size structure of the landed fish (Punsley et al., 1994), the fishery could lose 30-50% of the approximately 98 million individual yellowfin tuna estimated to recruit to the fishery each year. Sustained removals of this magnitude, combined with environmental variability, could pose problems for long-term sustainability of the ETP yellowfin tuna stock; moreover, the change in fishing-effort patterns leading to this effect on yellowfin tuna would likely contribute little to recovery or sustainability of ETP dolphin stocks.

ID AMERICAN BARLEY MARKET; ECONOMICS
AB The eventual signing of the 1995 Farm Bill into US law as the 1996 Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform (FAIR) Act in April 1996 has been heralded as a clear and unambiguous signal that the USA is committed to full liberalisation of farm policy, and hence of farm trade. Elimination of set-aside and deficiency payments, and provision of apparently generous, if strictly limited,'production flexibility contract' payments to arable crop farmers, are seen as releasing and encouraging US farmers to compete effectively on the world market, to the potential detriment of European agriculture, and to provide additional impetus to further European CAP reform. Internally, FAIR can be seen as representing a logical and coherent progression of decoupling, begun in the 1985 Food Security Act (FSA) and continued through the 1990 Food, Agriculture, Conservation and Trade (FACT) Act. However, the apparent strength of the US farm commodity groups in the eventual provisions of FAIR, coupled with important omissions and remaining unresolved issues, leave a strong potential for FAIR to become foul from both internal and external perspectives. Perhaps the 'fairest' provision of the legislation is the commitment to a Commission on the appropriate role of government in agriculture, while the 'foulest' implication is that government itself is capable of providing such an assessment.

ID HEALTH PROMOTION; COMMUNITY COALITIONS; PREVENTION
AB CINCH (Consortium for the Immunization of Norfolk's Children) is an urban coalition that was developed in 1993 to improve childhood immunization rates in Norfolk, Virginia. CINCH involves diverse citizens and institutions in effective community-based assessment, planning. and action. A needs assessment from 1993 found that only 49% of Norfolk 2-year-olds were adequately immunized. Using this data, CINCH developed a plan focused on education and communication, support for at-risk families, increased access to immunizations, and improved immunization delivery. After federal funding ended in 1995, members voted to expand the scope of the coalition to address additional child health needs and to broaden the membership. CINCH is a model for a sustainable city-citizen learning environment that intervenes to "help families help themselves to better health." The coalition is presented as an organization that focuses on community empowerment and develop ment The stages of coalition development and implications for coalition implementation in other sites are discussed.

ID CLIMATE-CHANGE; CARBON SEQUESTRATION; CONVENTION; ECOSYSTEMS; ASIA
AB The Framework Convention on Climate Change addressing the problem of global warming at the international level, was signed in 1992. A protocol to the convention, including emission limitation or reduction commitments, was recently adopted. Joint implementation (JI), in any of its various forms, constitutes one of the mechanisms for reducing overall greenhouse gas emissions. The basic rationale for JI is to achieve the greatest global environmental benefits for the least cost. JI can in principle be a useful instrument in implementing environmental agreements. In this article, the authors argue that JI raises several issues of concern in relation to the realization of different aspects of sustainable development. More specifically, in the forestry sector,JI often seems to conflict with local and global environmental priorities. Moreover, the basic premiss on which JI forestry projects are predicated, namely the carbon sequestration potential, is not borne out by available scientific date. In the long term, such projects have a very limited capacity for carbon sequestration considering that woody biomass eventually decays or burns.

AB In ancient times, people practised cleanliness often for religious reasons. In the Greek period the idea that human health is related to the physical environment developed. The notion that microscopic organisms might cause infectious diseases begun to take shape in the 16th and 17th century. Nowadays hygiene concentrates on manipulating and controlling the environment for the benefit of human health. In household and institutional practice, hygiene is mainly dedicated to the control of micro-organisms in the inner environment. Household cleaning plays an important role in establishing and maintaining an adequate level of hygiene. In cleaning research therefore substantial attention is paid to the interrelation between cleaning and removal of micro-organisms. In general a worse soil removal appears to lead to a lower level of hygiene. In the past decades technical measures to reduce the environmental impact have affected household and institutional cleaning processes. In several ways this has degraded the level of cleaning and indirectly the level of hygiene. In the future more environmental measures that may affect the level of hygiene are to be expected. Scientists and professionals dealing with hygiene should be aware of these phenomena and should search for cleaning processes that are fit for use, sustainable and that do not endanger the level of hygiene.

AB Sustainable systems for land and natural resource management must be biologically, economically, and socially sustainable. Scientists and educators have historically viewed their role as developing new knowledge and technology to enhance biological and economic sustainability. Scientists have traditionally viewed sociopolitical sustainability and policy development as beyond our appropriate roles. Changing public values and perceptions on appropriate land use and natural resource protection are forcing land grant universities and their scientists and educators to re-evaluate traditional paradigms. The animal science community, in concert with the social and other biological sciences, must become more proactive in decision making processes on appropriate land use and natural resource management if we are to remain relevant. This paper describes the current situation and outlines approaches for the research and education communities to be important contributors to collaborative decision making processes on land and natural resource management.

TI Palm heart harvesting in the Brazilian Atlantic forest: changes in
   industry structure and the illegal trade
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE Amazon forest; Euterpe edulis; frugivores; keystone species; sustainable
   management
AB 1. Until the late 1960s, Euterpe edulis was the most important edible palm species in the Brazilian markets. Since then, overharvesting of natural stands and the limited scope of plantations have caused the industry to shift to the multistemmed E, oleracea from the Amazon river estuary.
   2, As a result of the relocation of the industry, the structure of the palm harvesting industry has changed and illegal trade has continued to exploit the remaining natural stands of E, edulis.
   3, it is suggested that, to avoid the total harvesting of E. edulis and to achieve sustainable management of the palm heart, it will be necessary to diversify the local economy, create incentives for small land owners to improve their management practices, while keeping their competitiveness against the illegal trade, create the incentive of new sources of palm hearts and create a 'green stamping' For management palms.
   4, Transformation of the illegal structure of the palm heart industry is probably the only solution to avoid the total depletion of the wild stands of E. edulis.

TI Computer-supported collaborative negotiation methodology
SO JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
AB The development of large-scale civil engineering projects requires the collaboration of experts from different specialties. However, conflicts and disputes occur regularly during the entire life cycle of large-scale projects due to the complex structure of organization and the different types of expertise involved. If these disputes or conflicts cannot be resolved or addressed quickly and effectively, the collaborative mode of the participants can be affected, creating a hostile environment in which progress of the project will slow to a halt. Therefore, better methodologies are needed to improve the collaborative process and to create more effective, efficient, and sustainable solutions to conflicts, This paper presents a methodology for facilitating the negotiation of conflicts during the development of large-scale civil engineering projects. Two fundamental theories are used in this methodology: (i) game theory, which is the study of players' actions based on the premise that the decision of any player can affect the payoff of all players; and (2) negotiation theory, which is the study of the interactions between parties, designed to reconcile their differences and produce a settlement. The strong support given by these two theories to negotiators is highlighted in the following observations. First, people need to negotiate because of their conflicting interests, From the negotiator's point of view, expressing the interests of all participants is very important in conflict resolution and can be accomplished by following the principles outlined in negotiation theory. Once the interests have been expressed correctly, the influence of positions or of conflicting interests on the overall negotiation outcome is evaluated using game theory. Based on these two fundamental theories, this paper presents a collaborative negotiation methodology and a computer agent named CONVINCER, which incorporates that methodology to facilitate or mediate the negotiation of conflicts in large-scale civil engineering projects. Hypothetical case studies and resolution processes demonstrate the effectiveness of the CONVINCER agent in conflict resolution. Results of applying the methodology to different scenarios also show that the CONVINCER agent provides efficient, effective, and sustainable solutions, thus improving the conflict resolution paradigm in the A/E/C industry.

AB Hertzian indentation testing is proposed as a protocol for evaluating the role of microstructure in the mechanical response of dental ceramics. A major advantage of Hertzian indentation over more traditional fracture-testing methodologies is that it emulates the loading conditions experienced by dental restorations: Clinical variables (masticatory force and cuspal curvature) identify closely with Hertzian variables (contact load and sphere radius). In this paper, Hertzian responses on four generic dental ceramics systems-micaceous glass-ceramics, glass-infiltrated alumina, feldspathic porcelain, and transformable zirconia-are presented as case studies. Ceramographic sectioning by means of a "bonded-interface" technique provides new information on the contact damage modes. Two distinct modes are observed: "brittle" mode, classic macroscopic fracture outside the contact (ring, or cone cracks), driven by tensile stresses; and "quasi-plastic" mode, a relatively new kind of deformation below the contact (diffuse microdamage), driven by shear stresses. A progressive transition from the first to the second mode with increasing microstructural heterogeneity is observed. The degree of quasi-plasticity is readily apparent as deviations from ideal linear elastic responses on indentation stress-strain curves. Plots of threshold loads for the initiation of both fracture and deformation modes as a function of indenter radius constitute "damage maps" for the evaluation of prospective restoration damage under typical masticatory conditions. The degree of damage in both modes evolves progressively with load above the thresholds. Strength tests on indented specimens quantify sustainable stress levels on restoration materials after damage. The most brittle responses are observed in the fine glass-ceramics and porcelain; conversely, the most quasi-plastic responses are observed in the coarse glass-ceramics and zirconia; the medium glass-ceramics and alumina exhibit intermediate responses. Implications of the results in relation to future materials characterization, selection, and design are considered in the clinical context.

AB The aim of this paper is to show how the environmental practices of a restaurant may be evaluated in a quantitative way. For this, a new methodology, sustainable development records (SDR), was used. This allows financial, environmental and social aspects of an operation to be handled in a systematic way.
   The results of the two sustainable development audits show that the restaurant washes more dishes per unit of chemicals used in 1994 than in 1991. However; there is a negative trend regarding the number of meals served per unit of water used and waste generated, which suggests that the restaurant in 1994 is more wasteful with these resources than in 1991. On the other hand, this might be explained by the fact that the restaurant has increased its use of primary products. The environmental ratios are increasing for both chemicals and energy, which means that more and more of the resources used are environmentally acceptable. The lowest environmental ratios are those for provisions (<2%) and transportation (<5%), which means that not more than 2% of the provisions and 5% of the transportation are environmentally acceptable in the long run. The restaurant's ratio of satisfied customers as well as its environmental image is improving, while the profitability has not changed.
   The results of this paper point to a general problem of environmental auditing in regard to the evaluation of perceived positive or negative developments of an individual enterprise, since there might be an opposite implication for the larger system. It is therefore crucial to look at several hierarchical levels in order to be able to assess the effects of environmental measures. (C) 1998 Academic Press Limited.

AB Coastal-zone sustainability policies are socially constructed It follows that their effective implementation depends on the sustainable voluntary co-operation of stakeholders with competing interests and priorities. No form of integrated coastal-zone management can nurture such co-operation as long as the objective is to determine 'best' policies, derived by expert-based rational analysis, instead of seeking to identify 'correct' policies, ones that can draw the maximum possible stakeholder support. The latter task requires a cc-operative coastal-zone management that incorporates the relevant public discourse into the policy formation process in a direct, proactive and conflict minimizing manner: Towards this end, four major challenges are examined for maximizing the stakeholders' motivation for voluntary co-operation: (I) optimism about the level of optimism; (2) agenda setting; (3) value discourse; and (4) information and empowerment.

AB The Ziarat forest in southwestern Pakistan a fragile ecosystem. Forest health poor because of harsh growing conditions and dwarf mistletoe infestations; and natural regeneration of the native juniper is sparse. Human use of the forest, especially fuelwood harvesting and grazing, has caused severe degradation. Yet because of its location, its advanced age, and the range of goods and services it provides, the Ziarat forest is a unique resource. The local people are aware of the tenuous condition of their forest, and attempts to manage this forest in a sustainable manner have begun.

TI Improving dairy farm sustainability I: An approach to animal and crop
   nutrient management planning
SO JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
ID AGRICULTURE; NITROGEN; SYSTEMS; POLLUTION; ALFALFA; MANURE; CORN
AB This two-part article reports on a process for integrating knowledge to develop and evaluate nutrient management plans for dairy farms. The focus is on accounting for and managing N, P, and K on a commercial farm. The case study farm was a well managed, progressive dairy farm located in central New York with 320 lactating cows (Bos taurus), 290 heifers, and 600 acres of crop land. This farm had the resources and management skills that are a model for dairy farming in the future. However, mass nutrient balances indicated that 60 to 72% of imported N, P, and K were in excess of nutrient exports from the farm; 60 to 80% of the imported nutrients were from purchased feeds. Evaluation and refinement of animal diets resulted in a reduction in crude protein content of the rations by 2 percentage points while supporting a 13% increase in milk production and a 34% decrease in total N excretion. Partial budgets projected that ration reformulation increased net farm income by $40200. Implementation of a crop nutrient management plan was expected to decrease fertilizer purchases and application expenses by about $1350, but construction of a remote manure storage pond and custom spreading of manure resulted in a decrease of net farm income of $4000. The vast quantity of data required and the complexity of the analysis indicate that developing computerized decision aid tools will be necessary to apply the process to a large number of farms.

SO JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION AGRICULTURE

ID NITROGEN DYNAMICS; MANURE; MODEL; SOIL; COWS
AB This paper continues the analysis of nutrient management on a case study dairy farm in New York State. In Part I, it was found that 60 to 70% of the imported N and P were not accounted for in the exported milk, crops, and animals. The purpose of this paper is to present a process for accounting for the fate of the excess nutrients and to determine the extent to which they were contributing to air and water pollution from the farm. Environmental losses of N and net excess of P in different subsections of the farm were estimated. Losses of N from volatilization on the barn floor and in storage were estimated to be 16% of excreted N, As a partial check on these results, manure nutrient composition for lactating cows was analyzed at excretion, entering storage, and leaving storage. Soil leaching losses from the farm were calculated using the LEACHN model, and were 9% of total N inflows to the farm. Predicted nitrate N concentrations in the leachate were 10.6 ppm. Results from monitoring a stream originating from the farm gave an annual average of 14.4 ppm of nitrate N, About 80% of the total N inflows were accounted for as milk sold (25%), animals sold (2%), leaching losses (9%), and volatilization/denitrification losses (46%), Environmental losses accounted for 75% of the excess N, Projected scenarios for increased use of farm-produced forages, reduction in fertilizers, and increased feed conversion to milk resulted in only minor improvements in the nutrient imbalance on this farm.

ID SEGREGATION; POLICY
AB The geography of urban ethnic conflict has been extensively researched and described in Northern Ireland. By comparison the literature on rural areas is weak and confined mainly to ethnographic accounts of life in farming communities. This paper offers some limited redress by focusing on a spatial analysis of two villages in mid-County Armagh, an area: that has experienced some of the worst internecine conflict over the last 27 years. The paper begins by exploring key concepts in urban segregation including 'critical mass', 'tipping point' and 'institutional completeness' and argues their relevance to understanding divided rural communities. This is followed by a review of the literature on rural conflict in Northern Ireland which debates the relative importance of kinship, locality, social class and religious cleavages. The importance of demographic shifts are highlighted leading to a case study describing the experiences of a marginalized and polarized enclave Protestant village. The implications for policy makers are set out focusing on the need to build these issues into a more inclusive definition of rural planning and sustainable regeneration.

ID SURGICAL TREATMENT
AB We retrospectively reviewed 64 patients treated by the following methods: continuous head halter traction in bed (2 patients), cervical brace (19 patients), plaster bed holding head and trunk (15 patients), and Crutchfield's skull traction (28 patients), using the Japanese Orthopaedic Association grading system of motor function. A rate of "no disability" was achieved in 27% in the upper and 26% in the lower extremities. The achieved function was maintained in most patients, and some improved further during the follow-up period (3-10 years). The overall achievement rate was 34% in the upper and 28% in the lower extremities. Because the rate was significantly influenced by the degree of disability before treatment, the candidates are patients with mild disability for whom "no disability" is the goal.

AB South Florida and the Everglades have been under intensive development since 1850 by Federal and State governments who encouraged and financed extensive drainage and hydraulic changes, primarily for agricultural settlement. Agricultural development of the sugar industry in the northern Everglades adjacent to Lake Okeechobee rapidly progressed only after the 1900s. Political and resource management conflicts have arisen because policies which once favored development are now being reversed by policies and regulation efforts to restore and conserve natural ecosystems. Currently, the environmental and ecological impacts of agricultural land use adjacent to natural wtlands of the Everglades are being assessed. The objectives of this paper are: (1) to outline the historical development of south Florida and the sugar industry, (2) to relate this history to political and management policy changes occurring as it pertains to ecosystem restoration and the multiuser competition for water/land resources, and (3) to propose how integrated resource management might be utilized for a sustainable Everglades and south Florida. This paper outlines the historical paradox of urban settlement, land development, and agricultural production, with efforts in the recent decade to acquire, manage, and preserve land and water resources for natural areas conservation. Only though the use of integrated resource management will the defined resource conflicts be mediated.

ID FLOOD DEFENSE
AB Relative sea-level fluctuations during the Holocene period have combined with medieval to present saline floodplain embanking to reduce the inter-tidal saltmarsh area in Essex from 40000 ha to 4400 ha. The present loss by erosion is estimated at 2%/annum for the county, and the reduction in these areas is not only detrimental to related habitats but has caused an increasing requirement for flood-defence financial investment.
   Recent initiatives by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the Environment Agency and English Nature have created mechanisms and opportunities to develop sustainable flood-control structures where coastal re-alignment has been the preferred option.
   The Orplands frontage covers 2 km of sea wall which have been deliberately breached to allow 40 ha of rare saltmarsh to re-establish. At Abbotts Hall, an arable held of 20 ha has been converted to its former saltmarsh by creek re-establishment and tidal inundation by reversal of existing sluices. These two schemes have (a) regenerated habitats for halophytic and semi-halophytic plants, marine and brackish invertebrates, and (b) provided roost, feed and breeding areas for birds and nursery areas for marine fish fry. Apart from flood control and habitat creation, particular features were incorporated to provide niche locations for targeted types of wildlife.

Sustainable development is discussed, as is the philosophy and practice of health promotion and environmental health. Common approaches are identified and the links in relation to key areas of activities, strategies, values and principles are outlined. Finally, recommendations are made and conclusions drawn in relation to the overlap between environmental health action, Agenda 21 strategies and health promotion practice.

AB The growing influence of non governmental organizations (NGOs) in international health is occurring in the face of major challenges and opportunities. These challenges include the continued increases in global poverty status, the growing influence of private-funded health systems, the need for sustainability of external-funded programs, and the clamour for community participation in the planning and management of external-funded programs.
   Opportunities include the near universal recognition of the indispensable roles of NGOs by bilateral institutions and governments, the current emphasis on global trade by developed countries, and the need to develop political and economic systems that are equitable and promote social development. This article is an overview of these challenges and how these challenges can become excellent opportunities for NGOs to improve the health and social development of target communities in developing countries.

ID AFRICA
AB This paper examines the most recent initiative in TMF conservation in the form of the Cross River National Park (CRNP) project. Against the background of general problems of environmental and resource conservation in Nigeria, and in specific terms, the poor record of previous TMF management and conservation, it is argued that the CRNP is a new wine in an old skin, and may not be making any meaningful difference in checking the extent and rates of TMF loss in Nigeria. Two fundamental challenges critical to the sustainability of the CRNP are discussed, namely, sustaining local community support and engendering institutional co-operation. The paper concludes that to succeed, new TMF conservation initiatives in Sub-Saharan Africa need to be built on a proper understanding and analysis of the wider context of environmental and resource conservation policy and the track record of their implementation.

This paper describes a framework which clarifies the nature of the roles and responsibilities of all people making decisions which affect the environmental impact of agriculture, as a preliminary step in the development of benchmarks or standards in a federal system of government to audit progress towards the achievement of ecologically sustainable agriculture in Australia. It is argued that farmers make many decisions which have significant environmental consequences on their farm - what we have termed localized impacts. It should be possible to derive various benchmarks or standards against which the effectiveness of farmers in dealing with their localized environmental impacts may be measured and assessed, Other environmental effects associated with agriculture, whilst observable on the farm, may be traced back to decisions made by others, in local, regional, state or federal management agencies. Decisions of such agencies affect the functioning of whole ecological and hydrological systems, and are observable as widespread environmental impacts - what we have termed systemic impacts, Consequently, it should be possible to derive a series of benchmarks and standards relevant to the responsibilities of decision makers in the various spheres.

AB The Central Appalachian region of North America includes a large number of forest types with a diverse fauna and flora that have long been valued for a wide spectrum of uses. Unmanaged logging decimated these forests about 100 years ago, and other more recent disturbances have resulted in fragmentation and dramatic changes in composition and structure. Despite these disturbances, the forests recovered and their resiliency is now being tested as a large percentage of once logged and burned forests again approach economic maturity. Land managers are now faced with decisions about forest harvesting that are both uncertain and controversial with respect to their impacts on long-term sustainability of forest products and other values. Given past abuses of these forests, there is widespread opposition to logging, especially clearcutting, in nondeveloped forested areas by many individuals and organizations. Surprisingly, however, much less attention has been given by these same opponents of logging to conversion of forests for development, which permanently removes land from forest cover and makes the remaining fragmented forest harder to manage. Due to their proximity to ever-enlarging suburban developments, Central Appalachian forests are more threatened by development than by timber harvesting. It is possible that logging in this region, when conducted as part of sustainable management system that considers stand and landscape-level consequences, may actually help protect forests from conversion to other uses.

AB Until recently, much of the world shared the conviction that the Earth's environmental and social woes would be resolved by advances in science and technology. Today this once-cherished illusion has faded, swept away by numerous development initiatives that have fallen short of goals now recognized as naively optimistic. The global challenge of achieving sustainable development has proven far more complex than originally envisaged and it is now clear that social and cultural considerations are as much a part of an enduring and equitable solution as science, technology and economics. in 1992, the UN Conference on Environment and Development focused the world's attention on the need for ecological sustainability, defined as 'development which meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs'. The social and cultural dimensions of this process, however, were largely ignored, and it is only recently that the need to adapt sustainable development to specific socio-cultural contexts is beginning to gain wide recognition. The emerging consensus is that development which is sustainable must maintain both ecological and socio-cultural systems.

AB The subsurface domains of soils and sediments have typically been conceived as dark and lifeless. Yet these subsurface domains are predicted to contain higher species diversity than the above-surface world. Soils and sediments are connected by similarities in biota, biogeochemistry and ecosystem processes, Living organisms in soils and sediments contribute and maintain a range of valued ecosystem services, including clean water, food supply (agricultural crops, fisheries), substrate fertility, bioremediation of pollutants, and breakdown of organic matter. The connections between these domains facilitate the transfer of nutrients, particles and energy within the biosphere and may be critical for the Earth's sustainability, and yet these domains are typically only studied in isolation. The integrated landscape approach presented by the SCOPE subcommittee on Soil and Sediment Biodiversity and Ecosystem Functioning can offer new scientific findings that may yield important benefits far the economy and the environment.

AB Projected rates of agricultural clearing in the Ituri Forest of north-eastern Democratic Republic of Congo range from 0 to 0.1 per cent per year and suggest that deforestation for subsistence agriculture is not an immediate threat to the integrity of the Okapi Wildlife Reserve (OWR). If the human population continues to grow at over 3 per cent per annum, and bushmeat continues to be a major source of income for rural communities, subsistence-level exploitation of bushmeat may, however, not be sustainable. This paper proposes management approaches that address the demand for and supply of bushmeat, which are targeted at those political districts within the OWR where hunting is the greatest threat to populations of bushmeat species. These management approaches are designed to help conserve the Ituri's natural resources without compromising the health and income security of rural communities.

AB Nematode-trapping fungi, nematodes, and microbial biomass were quantified in conventionally and organically managed field plots in the Sustainable Agriculture Farming Systems Project at the University of California at Davis. There were four replicate plots (0.135 ha per plot) For each management system, and plots were sampled three rimes each year for 2 years. The hypothesis that nematode-trapping fungi would be more abundant in organically managed plots was partially supported: the number of species of nematode-trapping fungi was slightly but significantly greater in organic than in conventional plots, two species (Arthrobotrys dactyloides and Nematoctonus leiosporus) were detected more frequently in organic plots, and the population densities of A. dactyloides and N. leiosporus were greater in organic than in conventional plots. Two other species (A. haptotyla and A. thaumasia), however, tended to be more numerous in conventional than in organic plots, and the total density of nematode-trapping fungi was similar in organic and conventional plots. Bacterivorous nematodes were more abundant and microbial biomass (substrate-induced respiration) was greater in organic than in conventional plots. Suppression of the root-knot nematode Meloidogyne javanica, as measured in a bioassay, was not related to management system or population density of nematode-trapping fungi but was positively related to microbial biomass.

AB In 1979, when the Nordic Genebank was founded time was running short and Nordic germplasm of agricultural and horticultural crops was disappearing mi an accelerating rate. Today the ex situ collection includes about 30,000 seed accessions, consisting of local and modern varieties, landraces, collected material and genetic stocks. Through its regional networks the Nordic Genebank co-ordinates all activities concerning conservation, use and information of genetic resources in the Nordic countries, thereby providing support to the research and breeding community. The international engagement of the genebank is both at the European (European Go-operative Programme on Crop Genetic Resources Networks, the Baltic slates) and the international level (FAO, Southern Africa). Routine laboratory techniques include in vitro cultivation of vegetatively propagated species while contemporary methods are increasingly gaining importance in the work of characterising genetic variability. The Nordic Genebank is committed to continue its endeavour of conserving and providing plant genetic resources for the sake of World food production and sustainable use of wild habitats.

ID GERMPLASM COLLECTIONS; DUPLICATION
AB Very substantial collections of plant genetic resources have been developed over the last 50 years and current estimates are that over 6 million accessions ave conserved ex situ. Following the adoption of the Global Plan of Action for the Conservation and Sustainable Utilization of Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture by over 150 countries in 1996 if is timely to review current developments and issues in the availability and use of this significant resource. Availability depends On the physical status Of the stored accessions, the information that exists on them and on the existence Of an international framework for distribution and exchange of material between genebanks and users in different countries. Use can lake many forms including direct use by farmers and cultivators, introduction into plant breeding and germplasm enhancement programmes, evaluation and use in research. Improving both availability and use requires sustained programmes of international collaboration which have always been a feature of work on the conservation of plant genetic resources. The importance of developing and maintaining functional national and international networks should be recognized. Developments in the use of molecular techniques and information technology are making substantial contributions to germplasm conservation and use and both areas are likely to play an even greater role in the future.

AB British local government is undergoing the most far-reaching reorganisation for 25 years. Government's explicit objectives for change emphasised more local, cheaper, local government, although there were also implicit political objectives. Social services now represents the major directly-controlled local government activity; however, it was marginal in debates about reform. The impact of reform, particularly in terms of the size of the new unitary or 'hybrid' local authorities, may, however, be substantial. Research into the impact of reorganisation on authorities in England, Scotland and Wales raises questions about the extent to which new, smaller social services departments are sustainable.

AB This paper presents the results of a Scotland-wide survey on current practices of red deer management on the open hill. Many holdings collect detailed information about deer populations, but relatively few monitor the habitat. Old hinds were primarily targeted for culling on most holdings. This targeting policy for hinds makes it difficult to achieve effectively the stated goal-of a majority of holdings to control hind numbers. The results highlight the need to collect information on habitats as part of long-term sustainable management.

ID FISHERIES MANAGEMENT; WOMEN
AB Since 1990, all cod fishing in northern Norway has been regulated by individual vessel quotas. I argue that this quota regulation formalizes and strengthens male control of and access to the fisheries. The present distribution of fishing rights between the sexes is extremely uneven. This article discusses how the regulation directly and indirectly discriminates against women, despite the official ideology of gender equality in society. The logic of the fisheries management system follows and privileges a masculine fishing pattern and thus can be characterized as a patriarchal construction. An issue to raise is whether a woman friendly management system frustrates the aim of sustainable resource management.

AB Management scholars, business ethicists, and social scientists are challenged to conceptualize and measure characteristics of the "green" business and the sustainable corporation. This article discusses two approaches identified in recent management literature on the "greening" phenomenon, and places these approaches in context with major components of social science literature on green businesses. A set of 16 empirically tested hypotheses describing the "new ecological paradigm organization" is included as a starting point for future research.

AB An emerging subfield of strategic management is that dealing with the natural environment as it affects corporate strategy. To analyze this we organize the literature an environmental regulations and corporate strategy into a new managerial framework. Next we develop a resource-based view of the interaction between firm-level competitiveness and environmental regulations, including the conditions for the use of green capabilities. Finally, we analyze the green capabilities of multinational enterprises within a standard international business model, using firm-specific advantages (FSAs) and country-specific advantages (CSAs). We then use this FSA/CSA configuration to explore hypotheses on environmental regulations, competitiveness, and corporate strategy. (C) 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Technological innovation does not create new human capabilities and production processes ex nihlio. It only finds new ways to tap into and harness existing natural processes and energy Rows and directing them to human ends. Our ability to manipulate natural processes are doubly constrained: (1) by the attainable efficiencies of our devices with which we manipulate natural processes and (2) by the characteristics of the natural processes with which our appropriation of nature interferes. We have not understood the natural limits to technological innovation or accepted their consequences. Exponential economic growth has been possible only by greater and greater appropriations of the natural processes of the Earth's biosphere. Increasing appropriation of the biosphere has caused increasing damage and disruption to the very natural systems upon whose continued operation we depend. We have not counted;and have usually sought to deny, the rising negative feedback produced by technological innovation in service of economic expansion. The degradation of these natural systems signals we have already exceed the limits of sustainable levels of demand for resources and waste absorption capacity. That we have not taken appropriate action to curb increasing environmental degradation signals we have systematically overestimated our technological achievements, mystified how we have produced them, ignored their limitations, and failed to reckon their rising cost accurately.

AB The Cairngorm ski area is situated in the north-east area of Scotland in an area of outstanding natural beauty and ecological significance. Subsequently, development of the mountainside for skiing has been a contentious issue, particularly in the last two decades, as new development schemes have been proposed. Yet the skiing industry provides economic benefits, such as jobs and social stability, to the area. In 1992 a working party was established by the Secretary of State for Scotland with the purpose of developing a management scheme for the whole of the Cairngorm mountains. The draft plan was published in 1996, a part of which refers to the development of skiing at Cairngorm, A key aspect of future development at Cairngorm rests on a better understanding of skiers' needs and attitudes. This article is based upon interviews conducted with 490 skiers at Cairngorm during the winter of 1996/97, concerning both their expressed needs and environmental attitudes.

ID IMPACTS; RESIDENTS; ATTITUDES; ISSUES
AB Following an attempt to develop a sustainable, integrated tourism operation in Hana, Maul, a change of company ownership and a new approach to the problem of economic viability led to public protest and a deterioration of relations among residents, A proposal to strengthen the operation by building a resort golf course split the community and divided families, friends and neighbours. As the proposal proceeded through the public review process, frictions also developed between different County authorities, between the County Council and the company, and between company officials, The Hana controversy highlights the importance of inter-resident relations and illustrates some of the difficulties of implementing 'community-sensitive tourism' in destinations where people are sharply divided in their views on tourism development.

DT Article
ID PERINATAL-MORTALITY
AB A process of change was initiated in a Nicaragruan regional hospital in order to achieve a sustainable reduction of early neonatal mortality. A series of organizational, educational and hygienic measures was introduced, involving all staff in antenatal care, delivery care and neonatal care. Neonatal mortality decreased from 56/1000 live births in 1985 to 11/1000 in 1993. A commission of maternal and child health, a weekly perinatal audit, the active involvement of all staff and dedicated work of key individuals, as well as national policy decisions, are considered important determinants of the process. Keeping neonatal mortality in focus through continuous analysis of care routines, and through external exchange of ideas is important in order to sustain improvements anti to decrease further the mortality.

AB Diffuse knapweed, a biennial or short-lived perennial, and spotted knapweed, a perennial, are taprooted Eurasian weeds invading rangeland in the western United States and Canada. Knapweed (Centaurea spp.) invasion is associated with reductions in biodiversity, wildlife, and livestock forage, and increased erosion. Spotted knapweed grows to about 1 m and usually has purple flowers, whereas diffuse knapweed is slightly shorter, usually with white flowers. Persistent flower bracts on diffuse knapweed bear a rigid terminal spine about 8 mm long with four or five pairs of shorter lateral spines. Bracts on spotted knapweed have dark spotted tips. Knapweed management involves a combination of containing infestations and control efforts. Hand pulling in areas with small infestations can be effective for controlling spotted and diffuse knapweeds. Picloram applied at 0.28 kg ha(-1) provides control for about 3 yr. Effective long-term control of knapweeds requires periodic applications of picloram, which are only cost-effective on highly productive range sites with a residual grass understory. About 12 insect species have been released for knapweed biocontrol. Seed production has been reduced by 46% by insects feeding in the flower heads. Although insects have not reduced spotted knapweed densities, they may stress the weed and shift the competitive balance to associated species. Sheep grazing reduces the density of very young seedlings and may limit seedling recruitment into the population, In areas without a residual understory of desired plant species, revegetation of knapweed-infested rangeland is required, Components of any integrated weed management program are sustained effort, constant evaluation, and the adoption of improved strategies.

AB The objective of this study was to assess the influence of land use on soil aggregate size distribution and the consequences for organic C, N, and S concentrations in bulk soil and macroaggregates. The properties of a loamy and a clayey Oxisol used for continuous cropping, pasture and reforestation were compared with those of the native savannah ("Cerrado"). We measured aggregate size fractionation, C, N, and S concentrations in bulk soil, small (0.25-2 mm, SMA), and large macroaggregates (2-8 mm, LMA), and carried out a mineralization experiment with intact and crushed LMA. The aggregate size distribution pastures was not different from native Cerrado. Reforestation and plowing caused higher percentages of smaller aggregates which was more pronounced in the loamy than in the clayey soil. Total concentrations of C, N, and S were higher in the clayey (CL 21.5-23.3 g kg(-1); N: 1.2-1.4 g kg(-1); S: 178-213 mg kg(-1)) than in the loamy soil (C: 7.8-10.3 g kg(-1); N 0.5-0.7 g kg(-1); S: 87-132 mg kg(-1)) LMA of the loamy soil had higher C,N, and S concentrations than the bulk soil. SMA and both macroaggregate fractions of the clayey soil did not differ from the bulk soil. 71% of potentially mineralizable N in LMA of the loamy soil were only mineralized after aggregate disruption. In contrast, there were only small differences between crushed and intact IMA of the clayey soil. Therefore, we considered conventional tillage suitable For clayey soils. The loamy soil would require a more soil conserving system like no-till or crop-pasture rotation to improve sustainability.

AB Ecosystem management is managing areas at various scales in such a way that ecological services and biological resources are conserved while appropriate human uses are sustained. Major ecological services include allocation of productivity (energy flow), maintenance of soil fertility (nutrient cycling), and operation of the hydrologic cycle. Biological resources encompass all natural variation found in genes, species, and communities along with the processes that maintain this variation. The appropriateness and sustainability of human uses are dictated by the constraints imposed by the biological and physical environment and by legal mandates for land use. There are seven critical steps in ecosystem management. These are: (1) delineate (define) the ecosystem to be managed; (2) define strategic management goals; (3) develop a comprehensive understanding of the ecosystem; (4) obtain socioeconomic data; (5) link the socioeconomic and ecological data in an appropriate model; (6) implement experimental management actions; and (7) monitor management results to determine long-term success or failure. The significance of ecosystem management is that it focuses on ecological systems as a whole rather than on just some of their parts, includes public involvement in the goal-setting process, integrates conservation into economic activity, and represents a paradigm shift from 'linear comprehensive' management to 'cyclic-incremental' or 'adaptive' management.

AB Ecosystem management is widely proposed in the popular and professional literature as the modern and preferred way of managing natural resources and ecosystems. Advocates glowingly describe ecosystem management as an approach that will protect the environment, maintain healthy ecosystems, preserve biological diversity, and ensure sustainable development. Critics scoff at the concept as a new label for old ideas. The definitions of ecosystem management are vague and clarify little. Seven core principles, or pillars, of ecosystem management define and bound the concept and provide operational meaning: (1) ecosystem management reflects a stage in the continuing evolution of social values and priorities; it is neither a beginning nor an end; (2) ecosystem management is place-based and the boundaries of the place must be clearly and formally defined; (3) ecosystem management should maintain ecosystems in the appropriate condition to achieve desired social benefits; (4) ecosystem management should take advantage of the ability of ecosystems to respond to a variety of stressors, natural and man-made, but all ecosystems have limited ability to accommodate stressors and maintain a desired state; (5) ecosystem management may or may not result in emphasis on biological diversity; (6) the term sustainability, if used at all in ecosystem management, should be clearly defined-specifically the time frame of concern, the benefits and costs of concern, and the relative priority of the benefits and costs; and (7) scientific information is important for effective ecosystem management, but is only one element in a decision-making process that is fundamentally one of public and private choice. A definition of ecosystem management based on the seven pillars is: 'the application of ecological and social information, options, and constraints to achieve desired social benefits within a defined geographic area and over a specified period'. As with all management paradigms, there is no 'right' decision but rather those decisions that appear to best respond to society's current and future needs as expressed through a decision-making process. There are, however, wrong management decisions, including the decision not to make a decision. Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Pushed by recognition of the problems of fragmented management and growing interest in synthetic management goals such as sustainable development, biodiversity and ecosystem integrity, ecosystem-based management is of growing intellectual and practical significance in North America and elsewhere. Ecosystem-based management has several roots: the ecosystem approaches developed in several disciplines in the 1960s and 1970s, and earlier; more general systems approaches; and regional, bioregional, watershed and integrated resource management approaches. Although building on these, ecosystem-based management is a distinct activity that also draws on and complements ecosystem science, conservation biology, and environmental planning. Ecosystem-based management seeks to transcend arbitrary political and administrative boundaries, to achieve more effective, integrated management of resources and ecosystems at regional and landscape scales. Several key components of ecosystem-based management can be identified: defining the management unit, developing understanding, and creating planning and management frameworks. This paper draws on case studies of progress toward ecosystem-based management in Canada, the USA, and Australia to highlight lessons for implementing ecosystem-based management, and the need for new goals for it, in order to foster further, future development.

AB This article provides an overview of the process used by about 20 agencies of the United States federal government to review federal efforts to adopt an ecosystem approach and to recommend ways to strengthen this approach. The method utilized by these agencies was to form a Working Group representing each agency and to select seven case study sites where federal agencies were already working together to coordinate their efforts across an ecosystem. Based upon the results of the case studies and discussions with people involved in other ecosystem efforts, the Working Group identified key issues that need to be considered in order to strengthen this approach. Five issue groups were formed to further refine these issues and to make recommendations for effectively dealing with them. This paper provides brief descriptions of the case study sites, reviews the key issues and presents highlights of recommendations. It is the work of the authors and does not necessarily represent the views of their respective federal agencies or of the Interagency Ecosystem Management Task Force. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

DE ecosystem management; ecological approach; resource management
AB Ecosystem management can be thought of as the minimum set of tools a land manager should have available in attempting to define sustainable alternatives for the interactions of people and the environment. It is a term that specifically refers to a process or set of activities for addressing resource management, not a prescribed outcome. As a pre-decisional process, ecosystem management amends and expands the resource management tool kit that field-level professionals rely on to understand and manage lands and resources in an ecological context. The focus of this paper is to highlight the activities in the ecosystem management 'tool kit' that are common for many agencies and organizations. Natural resources exist within certain limits and capacities. Humans are faced with difficult choices in determining how they will interact with the environment to provide for essential materials and services and maintain a healthy environment. The approach does not necessarily make hard choices any easier. The ecosystem management tool kit does support making difficult choices in the most informed and professional manner possible.

AB Ecological research offers much to environmental managers, but current interactions between ecologists and managers are not as effective as they might be. This paper summarises four different types of research, which interact in their influences on managerial decisions. First is already available research sought by managers after a problem has been defined and information is needed to help reach a decision about how to solve it. The second type is research done to determine the success or failure of managerial decisions. This would be more effective if there were greater recognition that management consists of manipulative experimental tests of predictions based on models or theories for how to solve a problem. The third type of research is new basic and strategic research to investigate ecological processes to develop new understanding when management has failed and the environmental problem has not been solved. Finally, there is ecological research into the processes of decision-making themselves. This would seek to explain where, how and why decision-making had failed to solve the problem. Ecological inputs are needed into such research to determine how the results of previously available research were used in reaching the failed decisions. By understanding the opportunities provided by and the limitations of different types of ecological research, it may become easier for ecologists to provide more useful science to environmental managers.

AB This paper outlines two of the dominant ecosystem-management paradigms, one based on the traditional paradigm of ecological risk assessment and the other based on the health paradigm of ecological risk assessment. After showing the central ethical strengths and weaknesses of the traditional paradigm and the health paradigm, the essay argues that the uncertainties surrounding these two paradigms require ecosystem management to focus on default assumptions. The argument is that, just as most of the major battles of risk management are being fought on the ground of stakeholder participation and default assumptions, so most of the important battles of ecosystem management need to be fought on the battleground of stakeholder participation and default assumptions. Otherwise massive scientific uncertainties will compromise the credibility of both ecology and environmental management. Coping with problems from dioxin to nuclear power, the contemporary risk-management community is witnessing a dramatic battle between 'environmental hypochondriacs' and 'industrial cannibals' [Shrader-Frechette, K., 1994. Risk and ethics. In: Lindell, B. (Ed.), Comprehending Radiation Risks. Swedish Risk Academy, Stockholm, pp. 167-182]. The environmental hypochondriacs often argue that only zero risk is ethically and environmentally acceptable. They forget that virtually nothing has zero risk, provided analysis can detect the smallest threats. The industrial cannibals frequently maintain that almost any level of risk is justifiable, provided that the economic benefits are substantial enough. They forget that not everything has a price. In more sophisticated and realistic risk-management circles, a similar battle pits the wholists against the reductionists. The wholists believe that risk is a multiattribute concept. For them, health and environmental risks are complex and extra-scientific, involving not only threats to human and planetary safety but also threats to values-to trust, autonomy, sustainability, cultural integrity, equal protection, due process, future generations, and free informed consent [Slovic, p., Flynn, J., Layman, M., 1991. Perceived risk, trust, and the politics of nuclear waste. Science, 254, pp. 1604-1605; Shrader-Frechette, K., 1991. Risk and Rationality. Univ. of California Press, Berkeley]. The wholists believe that we manage health and environmental risks by reducing them and by enlisting the active participation of stakeholders in risk management. The reductionists, following part of the classic National Research Council/National Academy of Sciences 'Redbook' account of risk, maintain that risk is a scientific concept. For them, health and environmental risks must be assessed scientifically, typically as an average annual probability of fatality [National Research Council, 1983. Risk Assessment in the Federal Government: Managing the Process. National Academy Press, Washington, DC]. Following this definition, many reductionists believe that we handle health and environmental risks by educating members of the public-who supposedly are irrational, scientifically ignorant, and paranoid [Weinberg, A., 1988. Risk assessment, regulation, and the limits. In: Woodhead, A., Bender, M., Leonard, R. (Eds.), Phenotypic Variation in Populations. Plenum, New York, pp. 126-127]-and by having technical experts control risk management. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB As management philosophy focused on sustainability, ecosystem management calls for a reassessment of how we approach nature, science and politics. Implementation of ecosystem management will require changes in society's institutions. However, the exact requirements for institutional change are unclear. Therefore, in order to move toward implementing ecosystem management, a better understanding of the relationships between institutions and natural resource management will be required. The purpose of this paper is to examine institutional barriers and incentives to ecosystem management and to encourage a dialogue on this subject among resource managers, the public, and researchers. To this end, the paper identifies five problem areas where additional understanding of the institutional requirements for implementing ecosystem management is needed. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

SO LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING

AB Implementing ecosystem management requires learning to work with multiple factors, at multiple scales, using multiple boundaries and borders for organizing information. Traditional approaches often oversimplified information collection and analyses by relying on a limited set of classifications and information constructs. Experience has consistently shown that attempting to constrain analyses and assessments to one or a few organizing systems and related boundaries results in less than satisfactory information to support an ecological approach. Debates over which boundaries or borders are best and should therefore be the organizing device for ecosystem management are not useful or constructive. A more useful question is which set ecological approaches and their related boundaries provide the best information to address the resource issues at a particular time and place. Multiple boundaries, scales and factors increase the complexity of ecosystem management but also represent an essential component for improved understanding of the sustainable management of lands and resources.

AB Frame analysis has been often used by scholars studying New Social Movements to analyze their discourses and their ability to mobilise people. This paper refers to the application of 'frame analysis' to a different context, namely to discourses of both social movements and institutional actors in the context of public policy-making. More particularly, the study is concerned with the discourses of social actors who participate in the making of EU environmental policy. The advantages and limitations of frame analysis as a method for analysing discourse in an institutional context are discussed. Two case-studies are used to highlight the pros and cons of the method. First, the competing discourses of environmental organisations, business associations, and EU officials with regard to environmental sustainability and the Fifth Action Programme are examined. The second case study addresses the issue of Trans-European Transport Networks (TEN-Ts) and examines different types of framing of sustainable mobility developed by policy actors. Conclusions are drawn with regard to the contribution of frame theory in the analysis of policy-making processes.

AB The green mussel Perna viridis is an edible moilusc with enormous culture potential. This paper presents data on the reproduction, spat settlement and growth rate of P, viridis in Edaiyur backwaters on the east coast of India. The mussels exhibit two spawning periods and temperature appears to regulate the onset of reproductive events. Spat settlement densities are greater in the adjacent coastal waters as compared to the backwaters. Growth rate data show that the mussels reach an average shell length of 83 mm in 1 year. The results also show that shell and meat weight exhibit different seasonal patterns of growth in Edaiyur backwaters. In rope culture, marketable size (50-60 mm shell length) was achieved in about 6 months with an annual production of 47 kg m(-1) and biomass (wet meat weight) of 22 kg m(-1). The annual production values in Edaiyur backwaters are relatively higher than those reported from other parts of India. The present study suggests that Edaiyur backwaters represent a potential site for successful cultivation of P, viridis considering the availability of sustainable wild stocks of P, viridis and abundance of seed along with favourable environmental conditions.

AB The effects of 50 keV H+ and Ar+ ions on the mechanical properties and ultraviolet-visible absorption of the polymer CR39 were investigated. It was found that the H+ implantation produced a yellow-brown material with optical properties similar to amorphous hydrogenated carbon, whereas Ar+ implantation produced a material with optical properties more like evaporated amorphous carbon. The mechanical properties of the implanted material were measured using a nanoindentation technique and increases in both the elastic modulus and hardness (maximum sustainable contact pressure) were observed following irradiation with both ion species. Compared to Ar+ implantation, H+ implantation of CR39 was found to produce a more transparent material at an equivalent maximum sustainable contact pressure and therefore H+ ions were found to be more desirable than Ar+ ions for the treatment of CR39 optical components.

AB Comparative genomics offers unparalleled opportunities to integrate historically distinct disciplines, to link disparate biological kingdoms, and to bridge basic and applied science. Cross-species, cross-genera, and cross-kingdom comparisons are proving key to understanding how genes are structured, how gene structure relates to gene function, and how changes in DNA have given rise to the biological diversity on the planet. The application of genomics to the study of crop species offers special opportunities for innovative approaches for combining sequence information with the vast reservoirs of historical information associated with crops and their evolution, The grasses provide a particularly well developed system for the development of tools to facilitate comparative genetic interpretation among members of a diverse and evolutionarily successful family. Rice provides advantages for genomic sequencing because of its small genome and its diploid nature, whereas each of the other grasses provides complementary genetic information that will help extract meaning from the sequence data, Because of the importance of the cereals to the human food chain, developments in this area can lead directly to opportunities for improving the health and productivity of our food systems and for promoting the sustainable use of natural resources.

AB A novel thermodynamic perspective on natural selection is presented. In the case that life continuity is optimized in an ideal system, where relatively constant and homogeneous selective pressures favour a given competing species, natural selection leads that system to a stationary state of maximum genotypic uniformity of life and maximum sustainable consumption of available energy by life (competitive equilibrium). Structurally and functionally, this optimizing tendency towards competitive equilibrium looks similar to the optimizing tendency towards thermodynamic equilibrium of classical thermodynamics (maximum energetic uniformity and maximum degradation of available energy). The principle of competitive exclusion may thus be conceptually viewed as an ecological manifestation of the second law of (classical) thermodynamics. On the other hand, the novel thermodynamic perspective on natural selection is discussed with regard to the open and nonequilibrium system of nature, where selective pressures vary in space and time. In this case, natural selection can induce diversity instead of uniformity, though an optimizing tendendcy towards maximum sustainable consumption of resources (optimization of life continuity) always remains. Overall, it is concluded that the action of natural selection favours the maximization of the sustainable consumption of energy at the level of individual organism.

ID VELOCITY
AB Farm woodlots or plantations of salt tolerant trees may provide an economic use or reclamation treatment for salt-affected farmland within the irrigation regions of the Indus Valley, but the hydrological impact and sustainability of such plantations are unknown. Detailed measurements of plantation water use, watertable depth and soil conditions were recorded over 2 years in two small plantations with contrasting soil and groundwater salinity at Tando Jam in the Sindh province of Pakistan. The species monitored were Acacia nilotica, A. ampliceps and Prosopis pallida. Annual water use by 3- to 5-year old A. nilotica was 1248 mm on the severely saline site and 2225 mm on the mildly saline site. Water use by the other species was less than 25% of these rates, but this difference is largely explained by their lower density in terms of sapwood area per hectare. Water use by A. nilotica was considerably greater than annual rainfall, implying uptake of groundwater which was confirmed both by piezometric observations and chloride balance modelling to predict vertical water movement through the root zone. Plantation watertables fell from 1.7 m below surface in March to over 2.9 m in September, then rose again during irrigation of the surrounding farmland. Root zone salt concentrations remained high at the more saline site throughout the monitoring period, but at the less saline site there was evidence of increasing root zone salinity as salt accumulated in areas of the profile subject to root water uptake. Salt concentration in the upper profile decreased as the soil dried and water was absorbed from greater depth. Plantations using saline groundwater may be sustainable if occasional leaching and other salt-removing processes are sufficient to maintain root zone salinity at a level which does not excessively reduce tree growth.

AB Environmental weeds are an escalating problem worldwide. Integrated control is unable to keep up with the demands for management strategies for existing and new, potentially invasive plant species. The primary goal of the ecosystem approach used here is sustainable conservation management of natural systems. Only ecologically and/or economically viable habitats are given priority for environmental weed management. We recommend that habitats be ranked according to criteria that encompass the habitat's status, protection and management. Highest priority areas are heated first according to available resources to balance urgent environmental needs with management budgets. Practical guidelines in drawing up control programmes and management plans are provided. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

TI The terrestrial phosphorus economy of mid-Pacific atolls: Implications
   for the future
SO AMBIO
LA English
DT Article
ID ISLANDS; TUVALU
AB Major subsystems of the terrestrial phosphorus cycle on the densely populated, 142 ha motu of Fogafale, are: carbonate substrate (similar to 10(3) g P t(-1)), groundwater (similar to 0.4 g P t(-1)), terrestrial flora (similar to 0.22 t P ha(-1)) and fauna (similar to 18 kg P ha(-1)). Freshwater provides the principal medium for terrestrial geochemical atoll processes and is the central recycling plant for phosphorus from atmospheric fallout and decomposition of biotic waste. Present data cannot determine precise fluxes within and between all subsystems, but perturbations, resulting from increasing human populations and changing land use, may be estimated. Changes in Fogafale's biotic phosphorus capitals and increasing phosphorus-containing imports have skewed fluxes and transfer routes of biogenic waste. Atolls are dynamic systems, able to recover from environmental disruptions, but the sustainability and effectiveness of underlying biogeochemical cycles require quantification, monitoring and nurturing. In particular, the integrity of Fogafale's essential fresh groundwater needs to be ascertained and protected.

AB Institutions are the social rules that guide the design of strategies such as environmental management. Institutions can therefore significantly facilitate or hinder the realization of sustainable development. This paper relies on case studies of long-term waste management in Finland and California to explore institutional arrangements that facilitate the design of sustainable environmental management. The analytical focus is on the feedback between institutions and individual perceptions. Institutions influence the mental models with which individual decision makers understand environmental issues, and individual mental models in turn reinforce the institutional context. The main policy implication of the analysis is that long-term environmental considerations should, at the institutional level, be made the responsibility of independent social bodies that could pursue sustainability goals with autonomy and authority. The paper concludes with a discussion of potential technocratic and democratic modes of establishing autonomy for the long-term sustainability concerns in society.

AB This study assessed whether the mechanisms regulating cardiac norepinephrine (NE) synthesis with changes in NE release are influenced by functions of sympathetic nerves affecting transmitter turnover independently of transmitter release. Differences in arterial and coronary venous plasma concentrations of NE and its metabolites and of dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA), the immediate product of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), were examined before and during cycling exercise. Relative increases during exercise in cardiac tyrosine hydroxylation (as reflected by the %increase in cardiac DOPA spillover) matched closely corresponding increases in NE turnover, but were much lower than increases in NE release. The much larger relative increases in release than turnover of NE were largely attributable to the extensive contribution to transmitter turnover from intraneuronal metabolism of NE leaking from storage vesicles. This contribution remains unchanged during sympathetic activation so that the relative increase in NE turnover is much smaller than that in exocytotic release of NE. To replenish the NE lost from stores during sympathetic activation, TH activity need increase only in proportion to the smaller increase in turnover rather than the larger relative increase in release. The ability to "gear down" increases in tyrosine hydroxylation relative to increases in NE release provides sympathetic nerves the capacity for a more extended range of sustainable release rates than otherwise possible.

AB The common concept of fertilization should be widened into the more comprehensive concept of nutrient management being integrated with other production factors. On the basis of nutrient flows and cycles, and in order to reach the yield potential under the prevailing growth conditions, this includes better use of the different nutrient sources, the adaptation of crop rotations to nutrient supply, the consideration of soil heterogeneity and optimum nutrition of crops for better product quality and resistance, finally also prevention of avoidable nutrient losses. Different farming systems require different nutrient management provisions. Exploiting cropping is still widely used, but should be replaced by sustainable agriculture at low, medium or high yield level (depending on general growth conditions). The regional nutrient transfer (natural or by trade, e.g., into cities) and the global nutrient export pose special nutrient management problems. Due to future shortages of some nutrients there will be conflicting objectives, and it will probably be necessary to adapt food demands (via population number) to the resources available, not only for some countries but on a global scale.

AB Selective thinning of forests in the western United States will generate a large, sustainable quantity of softwood residues that can be an attractive feedstock for fuel ethanol production. The major species available from thinning of forests in northern California and the eastern Rocky Mountains include white fir (Abies concolor), Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), and Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa). Douglas fir chips were soaked in 0.4% sulfuric acid solution, then pretreated with steam at 200-230 degrees C for 1-5 min. After pretreatment, 90-95% of the hemicellulose and as much as 20% of the cellulose was solubilized in water, and 90% of the remaining cellulose can be hydrolyzed to glucose by cellulase enzyme. The prehydrolysates, at as high as 10% total solid concentration, can be readily fermented by the unadapted yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae D(5)A.

AB 1. The effect of riparian ecotone functional complexity and stream hydraulics on an upland river ecosystem has been analysed.
   2. The amount of nutrients retained by bottom sediment was lowest on a sandy substrate (range: 26-104 mg m(-2) P-PO4) and highest in wetland bays (range: 558-5368 mg m(-2) P-PO4). A stream bed covered by Berula erecta had about three times higher retentive nutrient capacity ((x) over bar = 584 mg m -2 day(-1)) than did a sandy substrate (x) over bar = 205 mg m(-2) day(-1)).
   3. The amount of allochthonous organic matter (CPOM) deposited on the stream bed decreased with current velocity. The trophic potential of CPOM, measured as total protein, was significantly correlated with the amount of deposited CPOM (r = 0.863; p < 0.00001) and depended on stream order.
   4. Both invertebrate and fish biomass in the upland river were significantly correlated with calcium/bicarbonate (benthos: r = 0.858; p < 0.006; fish: r = 0.918; p < 0.001).
   5. Fish biomass, diversity and species richness were highest in pools, lower in riffles and lowest in the run/transition zone.
   6. Macroinvertebrate biomass was highest at an intermediate riparian ecotone complexity with an adequate supply of organic matter and incident light. Fish biomass followed the same trend, being lowest in heavily shaded areas and in open channels without riparian vegetation (range: 1-4.5 g m(-2)), but highest in ecotones of intermediate complexity (range: 1.6-92.8 g m(-2)). The 'cascading effect' of invertebrate density depletion, which was inversely related to fish biomass, was observed seasonally.
   7. The above results indicate that riparian ecotone structure and the heterogeneity of the stream channel may regulate biodiversity, productivity and nutrient retention in the fluvial corridor. These quantitative data help to create alternative scenarios for sustainable river basin management. (C) 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

DT Article
DE Australia; globalisation; mass tourism; new tourism; regional
   development; travel
AB International tourist flows to Australia ave examined from the perspective of globalisation. The factors influencing such flows are identified and their geographical impact outlined. Inbound tourism is shown to be growing quickly in both absolute and relative terms and to have a metropolitan emphasis that contrasts with the non-metropolitan focus of domestic tourism. Tourism illustrates many of the social and cultural changes occurring in contemporary society; the nature of tourism is changing as society changes with a result that new forms of tourism are emerging. Particularly noteworthy is the shift from mass to 'new tourism'. The nature and likely impact of these changes in Australia is assessed. The paper concludes that growth rates comparable with those achieved in the past might not be sustainable.

AB By means of a long termed field experiment, carried out at the BAL Gumpenstein, different aspects of the nitrogen balance and their importance for grassland management have been worked on. The linear course of the curve for the nitrogen saldo within the observed fertilizing intensity from 0 to 240 kg N ha(-1) year(-1) showed a well balanced result at a fertilizing level up to about 150 kg N ha(-1) year(-1). Displacement of legumes was significantly stronger by nitrogen from mineral fertilizers than by nitrogen from farm manure. A comparison between mineral fertilized NPK treatments with the fertilizing systems "slurry" and "stable manure + liquid slurry" at an adjusted N-level showed a better efficience and advantage of the farm manure systems, increasing with the time of experiment.

DT Article
DE sustainability; timber; roundwood; alternative technologies
AB Case studies in the design and construction of three buildings (a prototype house, training centre and student lodge) illustrate the development and viability of innovative roundwood technology. The use of roundwood technology is an environmental response to the efficient use of small-diameter timber from forests. This provides a new, local resource for construction and reduces waste from forests, which is normally thinned out and burned, The technological development of roundwood is discussed in terms of building design, jointing, flexure, timber treatment and the construction process. This paper presents an integrated, multidisciplinary approach to the architectural design, structural design and construction process of a new technology.

   building services; sustainability
AB World-wide pressure on water resources is mounting as populations grow, consumption per capita increases, 'fossil' water resources are mined and the climate changes. Domestic water usage is a significant component of water demand. Under favourable circumstances, it can be met in part or in whole by rainwater collected close to an individual dwelling. Interest in such systems is growing especially in rural areas where either rainfall is well distributed through the year, or where surface water is absent, groundwater mineralized and centralized piped supplies unaffordable. Roofwater collection is also being practised on low-rise and high-rise buildings in some cities having wet climates, The principles and components of rainwater harvesting are reviewed. Factors leading to the growing use of domestic rainwater harvesting in three different developing countries (North China, East Africa cmd Singapore) as case studies are discussed along with current practices, design options for system components and considerations for water quality and treatment. The lessons from developing countries can be applied to a European context as some European towns are beginning to require rainwater collection for toilet/laundry facilities in some new buildings.

ID SUSTAINABILITY; AGRICULTURE; HEALTH
AB In 1993, several multi-disciplinary Eco-research projects were funded as part of a Tri-Council Secretariat established through the federal government's "Green Plan." One of the projects, which was centred at the University of Guelph, had the explicit goal of developing indicators for agroecosystem health. Because the human/social dimension is a basic component of agroecosystems, sociology was included as a contributing discipline to the Agroecosystem Health Project. In this article, sociology's role in that research is examined with respect to the question: Whither Sociology? or, How healthy is Sociology? This type of query can be understood by examining two conditions: the discipline's resource base (which reflects its capacity to respond to stress) and sociology's effectiveness (which is measured by how well it can meet its goals). Through a review of sociology's relevance for methods and analysis in the Agroecosystem Health Project, this article suggests that sociology faces a healthy future because it is highly adaptable and has goals that are relevant both to current trends in policy formation and new approaches to science.

AB Bertram and Watters defined the MIRAB model (Migration, Remittances, Aid, and Bureaucracy) as a development process where remittances and foreign aid are the main resources of small island economies. Bertram suggested that it is a perfectly "sustainable" development strategy, as long as the "rent" from remittances and international aid continues. But there is a great reluctance on the part of officials and economists to accept the model as valid and sustainable. To them, it does not seem right to live off international aid and migrant remittances. A favorable case can be made for MIRAB. Pacific Island peoples and governments should not feel guilty about accepting aid and remittances, because such "external resources" may be seen as representing revenues from invisible exports to industrialized countries. By exporting labor and geostrategic services, small Pacific Island states make the best use of the only comparative advantage they may have in international trade. Donor countries and migrant host countries also gain from this arrangement. In this paper, I look at reasons why some people hate MIRAB, then show why everyone should love MIRAB.

ID YIELD; SYSTEMS
AB Producers relying on the traditional central Great Plains cropping system of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-fallow could increase crop yield and resource sustainability by changing to more diverse crop rotations. Crops suited to the variable timing and amount of precipitation characteristic of this region need to be identified so that rotations can be diversified. This study was conducted to determine the effects of water deficit at various growth stages on leaf area index, plant height, yield components, soil water extraction pattern, and seasonal water use of black bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.). The study was conducted during the 1995 and 1996 growing seasons near Akron, CO, on a Rage silt loam (fine, montmorillonitic, mesic Pachic Argiustoll). An automated rainout shelter was used to eliminate precipitation. Irrigation treatments consisted of withholding water at vegetative, reproductive, or grain-filling growth stages. All treatments received 18.3 cm of water during the growing season. Water stress during the vegetative growth stage produced the shortest plants with the least leaf area. Soil water extraction and total water use were also least when water was withheld during the vegetative stage. Seed yield was reduced because of reductions in pods per plant and/or seeds per pod when water stress occurred during the reproductive stage. Black bean appears to have potential as a dryland rotation crop in the central Great Plains when soil mater profiles are near field capacity at planting and normal to above normal precipitation is expected.

AB Microbial genetic resources are collected and stored for many different reasons providing an organism base for future use and reference to support science and industry. There are almost 500 collections world-wide registered with the World Data Center for Microorganisms (WDCM). However, of the estimated 1.5 million fungi only 72000 strains have been described and less than 20% of these are held in collections. It is also evident that many microorganisms have only been isolated once as almost 50% of the species held by the WDCM collections are represented by one isolate only. Storage at ultra-low temperature has an essential role to play in securing these organisms for sustainable use. A two step method of cooling was initially employed which approximated -1 degrees C min(-1). Improved viability and stability was achieved by using linear cooling rates determined by cryogenic light microscopy.

AB This article describes the development of a framework for selecting a core set of indicators suitable for an integrated ecosystem health assessment of a governed landscape. Integrated assessments are those that consider a combination of biophysical, socioeconomic, and human health considerations. Highly governed landscapes are cultural landscapes that are strictly controlled by humans to the extent that they would revert to an entirely different form were it not for continued human intervention. One example of such a landscape, which serves as the setting for this investigation, is the former wetlands of the northeastern Italian coastal zone, which have been subject to widespread land reclamation and coastal development over the past century. The science of ecosystem health has been chosen as the frame of reference because "health" is not judged by the degree of "naturalness" but instead on the ability of the ecosystem to maintain and renew itself. The framework consists of first reviewing literature and methods related to ecological and environmental monitoring, state-of-the-environment reporting, landscape ecology, and sustainability. This is followed by the definition of indicator guidelines that are designed to assist in the evaluation and selection of potential indicators. A core set of indicators are then presented based on a conceptual framework devised for this purpose. indicators are classed as abiotic, biotic, and cultural, and selected according to the ecological districts comprising the study area. The ultimate goal is their application to an ecological monitoring and assessment program within a governed landscape such as the northeastern Italian coastal zone. Given such a commitment, the normal process of core indicator refinement can then proceed, based on such actions as further consultations with interested stakeholders and evaluation of methodological and practical constraints to their actual application.

AB Natural resource managers, environmental interest groups, and public agencies are interested in appropriate, identifiable, and measurable indicators of sustainability. At the same time, public agencies, including natural resource management agencies, are attempting to identify research and management priorities that address major environmental concerns at local and broad scales. The Identify the Specifics approach, described here, uses local (ecodistrict or smaller) ecological/biological "experts"' knowledge to identify and prioritize the local natural resources of concern (commonly species), associated management practices and ecosystems to form a concern matrix. Local ecological/biological concerns form the environmental base of a broader-scale (ecoregion/ecozone) concern matrix. This matrix identifies similarities and differences among local matrices and appropriate components for promotion to broader scales. Scale-specific matrices identify appropriate local, regional, and broader-scale indicators to monitor and assess, and provide public agencies with direction for documenting effects of management and identifying where research is needed. This approach can provide industries, public agencies, environmental interest groups, and governments with ecosystem-based, prioritized in formation for balancing social economic, and ecological concerns on public and private lands.

AB Recent developments in textual analysis in the social sciences can be used to analyse the phenomenon called the 'argumentative' or 'communicative' turn by, for example, Patsy Healey. In this paper, modern argumentation theory, in particular the pragma-dialectical theory of Frans van Eemeren and Rob Grootendorst, together with some elements from discourse analysis, are discussed as theoretical and practical tools in analysing and evaluating arguments used in planning. It appears that there are many features in planning texts that are predominantly rhetorical and which have to be taken into account in order to reveal the basic structure of argumentation. I also discuss how planning argumentation could be developed in order to answer the challenges of participation as well as other new demands, such as sustainability.((1))

AB In this paper I critically engage with the concept of geographical equity in order to reexamine notions of sustainable development and environmental justice. Although asserting a need to examine geographical equity considerations in greater detail in respect of the current environmental debate, it is argued that these always need to be examined in parallel with other dimensions of equity which underpin both sustainable development and environmental justice. Using the case of water management in southern California during the 20th century, I examine examples of intraregional and interregional cost transference which arise from water exports to meet urban development demands. Although clear evidence of cost transference exists, the most appropriate practical means for reducing or compensating these remains unclear.

AB An analysis was conducted that tested the usefulness of four methods-toxicity-based scoring, sustainable process index, concentration/toxicity equivalency, and human toxicity potential-for assessing human health impacts of chemical emissions. Each assessment method uses a different model with varying levels of complexity and sophistication to calculate a toxic equivalency potential. This indicator is a ratio that expresses human health risks associated with release of a toxic chemical relative to those of an equivalent, equally toxic release of a reference chemical. Predicted impacts of the compared toxicants depend on whether and how exposure is considered by each evaluation method. Relative toxicity scores produced by these methods vary by 3 orders of magnitude when the same compounds are analyzed; thus, method selection is critical. The human toxicity potential method is preferred for comparing toxic emissions. Of the four methods investigated, it incorporates the mast comprehensive approach to exposure assessment. Pollutants are ranked on the basis of health risks, assessed by using an explicit characterization of total human exposure to a toxicant.

   management; nutrient budget; nutrient-use efficiency
AB Investment in fertilizer must be profitable for soil fertility to be sustainable for commercial agriculture, otherwise only an exploitative system can be operated. Three methods of increasing the marginal return from fertilizer application to the marginal cost ratio to above one are considered: increasing the product price and/or decreasing the fertilizer cost; improving the efficiency of nutrient utilization through improved extension; and improving the efficiency of nutrient utilization by developing new cultivars and management techniques. Phosphorus (P) is used as an example and most emphasis is placed on the third method. Maximising the efficiency of P utilization is equated with minimizing the P fertilizer rate required to maintain the economically optimum P fertility status of a system. Ultimate efficiency is achieved in a system where the maintenance P fertilizer rate is equal to P removal in product. Losses of P in run-off, eroded material and leachate are usually minimal in well-managed systems so the main means of increasing efficiency are to minimize the accumulation of P in the soil as organic and inorganic P. Accumulation of inorganic soil P is minimized by maximising plant demand and minimizing soil reactions (removing yield limitations due to factors other than P deficiency, placing P fertilizer in zones with active root growth, avoid fertilizing in excess of plant requirements). Establishing crop rotations that maintain soil organic matter will limit loss of applied P into the organic pool. Opportunities for increased efficiency of P utilization through cultivar improvement include selection for traits that favor strong plant demand such as late maturity, increased longevity of rootlet activity, and increased P solubilization capacity. It is suggested that increased root surface area per unit of P required may be a useful index to indicate cultural conditions and varietal characteristics that favor strong plant demand on soil P and thus minimize soil losses.

SO FISHERIES
LA English
DT Article
AB The economic problems bedevilling many of the world's capture fishery resources are seen to lie, not in fishers' "greed," but rather in the existence of a perverse incentive system arising, in turn, from ill-defined or nonexistent property rights. If it is difficult to vest property rights to these resources in individual fishers, it is possible to vest the rights, on a collective basis, in groups of fishers. We use the term virtual communities to describe such groups of fishers. The term, originating with the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) Committee on Ecosystem Management for Sustainable Marine Fisheries, can, under the right circumstances, be applied to Individual Transferable Quotas (ITQs) schemes as well as to geographically based communities.

AB The panga Pterogymnus laniarius (Pisces: Sparidae) resource on the Agulhas Bank, South Africa is assessed using an age-structured production model. The values for the free parameters of the model are estimated using biomass indices derived from fishery-independent trawl surveys. Although the data are fairly uninformative about the productivity of the resource within the range compatible with the biological parameters, the results indicate robustly that the population has recovered from low levels in the mid-1970's and that it can sustain somewhat higher levels of fishing intensity. Risk analysis calculations are used to assess the relative merits of alternative sequences of future catches with the level of sustainable catch being very sensitive to the selectivity pattern of the gear utilised.

AB In 1994, the Canadian Standards Association (CSA) was asked by a coalition of twenty-three Canadian forest industry associations to undertake development of standards for Sustainable Forest Management (SFM). CSA agreed with the proposal and, for this purpose, formed a Technical Committee with representation from a wide variety of interested parties, including producers, woodlot owners, professionals and scientists, public and environmental groups, and governments. The open process, which was entirely that of CSA, was completed in two years, with the draft standards being approved by the Standards Council of Canada (SCC) as National Standards of Canada in September 1996. Verification that the standards have been achieved is accomplished through an independent audit conducted by a Registrar (certifying organization) accredited by the SCC. Certification is voluntary.
   The Standards framework consists of an environmental management system which is consistent with that of ISO 14001; however, requirements also include a public participation component, field performance measures, and the use of national SFM Criteria and Indicators developed by the Canadian Council of Forest Ministers, which in turn are based on results of the international Montreal process.

We used a series of criteria based on biology, sampling methods, and legal or particular status to select vertebrate indicator species for the province of Ontario. The criteria for selection were applied in a hierarchical manner, with species ecology given primary importance, followed by sampling considerations, and status criteria. The latter represented certain societal weightings and political or featured management concerns. Species fitting the selection criteria were placed in a four-dimensional matrix (with axes: broad habitat type, age class, trophic level, and spatial scale), and species were then chosen from among the matrix cells. The exercise reduced the total vertebrate species in two forest biomes (Boreal and Great-Lakes St. Lawrence) to a relative few, from which the final choices were made primarily based on expert opinion. In Ontario, the species selected as indicators of biological diversity will be used to test the underlying general hypothesis that forest management has no effect on species richness and species abundance, or the distribution of species in time and space.

AB In some Pleistocene soils, forestry practices on sustainability were started 80 years ago. On outwash plains the pine forests were changed into pine-beech forests ("Zweistufenwald"). On moraines, pine-oak-beech forests ("Dreistufenwald") were created.
   Litter decomposition and carbon mineralization were significantly higher in the more natural, mainly deciduous "Dreistufenwald" than in the pine forest (p less than or equal to 0.01), while C/N ratio was lower (p less than or equal to 0.001). Nutrient availability (K+, Mg++, Ca++, P2O5) increased, whereas the concentration of Al3+ ions was reduced to about one-third of that of the pine forest (p less than or equal to 0.001). Higher values of microbial biomass were obtained from the soil of the "Dreistufenwald". The increase in microbial biomass was mainly due to higher fungal colonization. Soil respiration (mu g CO2-C/g*h), specific microbial respiration (mu g CO2-C/mg C-mic*h) and carbon mineralization (mu g CO2-C/mg C-org*d) were significantly higher in the mixed forest during the entire investigation (p less than or equal to 0.01). Furthermore, the abundance of the soil fauna increased in comparison to the coniferous forest. This observation was made concerning the macroinvertebrates (Lumbricidae) as well as the mesofauna (Enchytraeidae, Collembola, Oribatei). With respect to earthworms, the number of species and the biomass was higher for all ecotypes.
   In the "Zweistufernwald" on outwash plains no improved soil characteristics could be detected. Litter decomposition was even lower than in the coniferous sites (p less than or equal to 0.001) and the concentration of Al3+ was higher (p less than or equal to 0.001). In the pine-beech forest, microbial biomass and soil respiration were only slightly higher. The biomass of the soil fauna did not differ significantly (p > 0.05) in most cases.
   Changes in decomposition rates were mainly due to the soil type and to interactions between soil and stocking (ANOVA). Both, soil and stocking influenced the microbial characteristics of the soils and the biomass of Collembola and Oribatei (p less than or equal to 0.001). Differences in the abundance of Enchytraeidae depended on the soil and the interaction of soil and stocking, while the abundance of earthworms could be explained solely by the soil (p less than or equal to 0.001). Analysis of covariance uncovered the significance of the soil fauna for the increase in soil respiration, specific microbial respiration and carbon mineralization.
   Moreover, soil fauna and soil microbes biased the C/N ratio, nutrient availability (K+, Mg++, Ca++, P2O5) and the concentration of Al3+ ions. A remarkable correlation occured between high biotic activity, increase in pH-values and decrease in concentrations of Al3+ ions in the more natural, mainly deciduous forest.

TI New approaches to sustainable hazard management for Venice

DE Venice; flooding; pollution; integrated management; sea-level rise
ID SEA-LEVEL
AB Venice is suffering from flooding, pollution and the neglect of its famous urban fabric. The situation will worsen with sea-level rise relative to the land, as the Lagoon continues to evolve from a low-energy coastal marsh to a high-energy marine system. The proposed solution - a system of mobile gates - appears to be flawed in that it does not tackle some of the fundamental causes of these problems, or cope adequately with sealevel rise. For sustainability, what is needed is a more systematic review of policy options and communications. The authors' initial assessment suggests that what is required is, first, a medium-to long-term integrated catchment and;coastal zone plan, implemented over 50 years or more, to tackle the pollution and the Lagoon's degraded morphology. Second, in the short to medium term (the next 50 years) small-scale local floodproofing works within Venice - designed to maintain the visual integrity of the city and be acceptable to its people - can alleviate much of the flooding, while the more long-term solution is implemented. That solution must involve the progressive reduction of the influence of the Adriatic on the Lagoon, to cushion against the flooding that it brings. To succeed, this approach will need new thinking, and new resources, skills and institutional arrangements.

TI Institutionalizing household waste collection: The urban environmental
   management project in Cote d'Ivoire
SO HABITAT INTERNATIONAL
LA English
DT Article
ID AFRICA; ASIA
AB The efficient disposal of municipal solid waste is critical in maintaining the quality of urban life. Household waste removal is one of the key factors in ensuring the health and safety of the population, but is often neglected in rapidly growing cities of the Third World. This paper presents a case study of the Urban Environmental Management Project in the Gate d'Ivoire in which groups of young entrepreneurs were trained to collect household solid waste in small cities of 20,000-50,000 inhabitants located outside the capital region. The project was a joint collaboration of the US Peace Corps and the Ministries of Interior and Health in the Gate d'Ivoire. It was conceived as a local response to an increasing municipal service burden caused by the national economic crisis of the 1990s and the government's efforts to reduce the size of the national budget by decentralizing services to cities, While community based solid waste strategies have been successful in large cities in other countries, this project demonstrates the potential for innovative arrangements at lower levels of the urban hierarchy. The paper also emphasizes the importance of formalizing public-private institutional arrangements in order to ensure their long term sustainability. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Attention to the sustainability of health intervention programs both in the US and abroad is increasing, but little consensus exists on the conceptual and operational definitions of sustainability, Moreover, an empirical knowledge base about the determinants of sustainability is still at an early stage, Planning for sustainability requires, first, a clear understanding of the concept of sustainability and operational indicators that may be used in monitoring sustainability over time, Important categories of indicators include: (1) maintenance of health benefits achieved through an initial program, (2) level of institutionalization of a program within an organization and (3) measures of capacity building in the recipient community, Second, planning for sustainability requires the use of programmatic approaches and strategies that favor long-term program maintenance, We suggest that the potential influences on sustainability may derive from three major groups of factors: (1) project design and implementation factors, (2) factors within the organizational setting, and (3) factors in the broader community environment, Future efforts to develop sustainable health intervention programs in communities can build on the concepts and strategies proposed here.

ID CONTRACEPTIVE USE; METAANALYSIS; GAP
AB This study reconsiders traditional hierarchy models that posit a learning model gf behavior change in which knowledge precedes attitudes, which in turn influence behavior. The case of contraception in Peru is considered and six possible knowledge, attitude, and practice permutations are developed. Contraceptive practice may precede detailed knowledge that may result in considerable misinformation. This misinformation may lead to dissatisfied users and discontinued use of health behaviors. Media campaigns designed to inform the public can create a more informed population of users, which in tom may create a more satisfied and hence sustainable user base, Assessing the fit of behavior change models is consistent with emerging work in development communication that has called for women's empowerment and informed choice to be cornerstones of health and development policy. The informed choice approach provides the basis for communication strategies that can more readily create a critical mass of support for such policies.

AB The change from swidden to sawah cultivation in Tara'n Dayak villages in West Kalimantan, indonesia, is presented as a long-term, complex incremental process in which distinct, unstable and often confusing production technologies figure as transitional forms. The transitional phases are discussed in terms of their efficiency and sustainability. It is argued that the failure to perceive and understand long-term processes of agricultural change may result in both misinterpretation of technological patterns and environmental variables, as well as of rules of labor and resource sharing.
