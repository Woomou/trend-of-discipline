AB The choice among alternative water supply sources is generally based on the fundamental objective of maximising the ratio of benefits to costs. There is, however, a need to consider sustainability, the environment and social implications in regional water resources planning, in addition to economics. In order to achieve this, multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) techniques can be used. Various sources of uncertainty exist in the application of MCDA methods, including the selection of the MCDA method, elicitation of criteria weights and assignment of criteria performance values. The focus of this paper is on the uncertainty in the criteria weights. Sensitivity analysis can be used to analyse the effects of uncertainties associated with the criteria weights. Two existing sensitivity methods are described in this paper and a new distance-based approach is proposed which overcomes limitations of these methods. The benefits of the proposed approach are the concurrent alteration of the criteria weights, the applicability of the method to a range of MCDA techniques and the identification of the most critical criteria weights. The existing and proposed methods are applied to three case studies and the results indicate that simultaneous consideration of the uncertainty in the criteria weights should be an integral part of the decision making process.

ID MODEL
AB REALM (REsource ALlocation Model) is a generalised computer simulation package that models harvesting and bulk distribution of water resources within a water supply system. It is a modeling tool, which can be applied to develop specific water allocation models. Like other water resource simulation software tools, REALM uses mass-balance accounting at nodes, while the movement of water within carriers is subject to capacity constraints. It uses a fast network linear programming algorithm to optimise the water allocation within the network during each simulation time step, in accordance with user-defined operating rules. This paper describes the main features of REALM and provides potential users with an appreciation of its capabilities. In particular, it describes two case studies covering major urban and rural water supply systems. These case studies illustrate REALM's capabilities in the use of stochastically generated data in water supply planning and management, modelling of environmental flows, and assessing security of supply issues.

AB The paper presents a decision support designed to conduct an economic-environmental assessment of the agricultural activity focusing on irrigation called 'Decision Support for IRRigated Agriculture' (DSIRR). The program describes the effect at catchment scale of choices taken at micro scale by independent actors, the farmers, by simulating their decision process. The decision support (DS) has been thought of as a support tool for participatory water policies as requested by the Water Framework Directive and it aims at analyzing alternatives in production and technology, according to different market, policy and climate conditions. The tool uses data and models, provides a graphical user interface and can incorporate the decision makers' own insights. Heterogeneity in preferences is admitted since it is assumed that irrigators try to optimize personal multi-attribute utility functions, subject to a set of constraints. Consideration of agronomic and engineering aspects allows an accurate description of irrigation. Mathematical programming techniques are applied to find solutions. The program has been applied in the river Po basin (northern Italy) to analyze the impact of a pricing policy in a context of irrigation technology innovation. Water demand functions and elaslicity to water price have been estimated. Results demonstrate how different areas and systems react to the same policy in quite a different way. While in the annual cropping system pricing seems effective to save the resource at the cost of impeding Water Agencies cost recovery, the same policy has an opposite effect in the perennial fruit system which shows an inelastic response to water price. The multidimensional assessment conducted clarified the trades-off among conflicting economic-social-environmental objectives, thus generating valuable information to design a more tailored mix of measures.

AB This paper tries to reconcile two sets of apparently contradictory results. One is the positive link, postulated in literature, between place attachment and civic activity, the other is the sociological claim that there is a negative relationship between place attachment and a person's social and cultural status (cultural capital), which in turn is known to be the strongest positive predictor of civic involvement.
   In order to resolve this inconsistency, I postulated two alternative paths leading to civic activity: the social-emotional path, in which the relationship between place attachment and civic activity is mediated by local social capital (neighborhoods ties), and cultural path., consisting of cultural capital and interest in own roots. I also postulated a negative link between place attachment and Cultural capital.
   A representative sample of 1328 subjects, coming from three regions of Poland, differing in historical heritage and objective rootedness of inhabitants, was used for analysis. In a series of structural equations, the two-path model was confirmed both in the whole sample and in each of the three regions separately. Similar results were obtained from a separate analysis run on data clustered into 114 communes. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Factors affecting the dynamics of the population of Fagus crenata in the
   Takakuma Mountains, the southern limit of its distribution area
SO JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
DE Fagus crenata; southern limit of distribution; empty nuts
AB The refugee population of Fagus crenata in the Takakuma Mountains, Kyushu, Japan, represents the southern limit of this species' distribution area. Because this population is the most exposed to the global warming effect, records of this population are likely to provide useful information on the response of this species to global warming. The aim of this study was to record the present status of this valuable population, enabling judgment of its sustainability. The density of successive F crenata trees and saplings was low regardless of the coverage of dwarf bamboo. Moreover, the proportion of empty nuts observed was considerably high, suggesting to be the likely major factor limiting recruitment of saplings or successors in this population. Radial growth of F crenata was shown to have been decreasing for the past 50 years, and there was a significantly negative correlation with the warmth index. The decreasing growth rate and poor regenerative ability caused by the high proportion of empty nuts suggest the possibility that this population will degrade further in the future, possibly being replaced by shrubs and small tree species.

ID POPULATION-GROWTH
AB The expansion of urban land promises to have an increasingly significant influence on US forest management in the coming decades. Percent of the coterminous United States classified as urban increased from 2.5% in 1990 to 3.1 % in 2000, an area about the size of Vermont and New Hampshire combined. Patterns of urban expansion reveal that increased growth rates are likely in the future. The most urbanized regions of the United States are the Northeast (9.7%) and the Southeast (7.5%), with these regions also exhibiting the greatest increase in percent urban land between 1990 and 2000. Forests near urban communities face a special set of challenges that will only intensify as these communities grow in area, population, and complexity.

AB Urban land in the United States is projected to increase from 3.1 % in 2000 to 8.1 % in 2050, an area 2 of 392,400 km, which is larger than the state of Montana. By 2050, four states (Rhode Island, New Jersey, Massachusetts, and Connecticut) are projected to be more than one-half urban land. The total projected amount of US forestland estimated to he subsumed by urbanization between 2000 and 2050 2 is about 118,300 km, an area approximately the size of Pennsylvania. Because of this urban growth, a more regional planning and management may be needed to sustain forest products and ecosystem M. services required by a growing urban population.

AB The developmental stage of a discipline can he gouged by the nature of its publications. Major themes of the 750 presentations at the 1st World Congress of Agroforestry, Orlando, Florida, 2004, were biological and ecological (28%); communication and knowledge integration (24%); and economics, marketing, and social issues (23%). The presentations related mostly (88% of total) to the tropics. About 55% of the authors came from educational institutions, 21% represented governments, and 13% represented nongovernmental organizations. The presentations showed that sustainability continued to be a major conceptual foundation of agroforestry, but there was considerable tropical-temperate contrast in efforts to attain sustainability. Although issues such as poverty alleviation, food security, and attainment of the Millennium Development Goals dominate the research and development agenda in the tropics, the focus in the temperate region is on environmental services such as carbon sequestration , water quality enhancement, and biodiversity conservation. The nature, diversity, and distribution of presentations as well as the current trends in agroforestry research suggest that agroforestry is maturing as a robust discipline.

ID BEHAVIOR
AB Industrial ecology has mainly been concerned with improving the efficiency of production systems. But addressing consumption is also vital in reducing the impact of society on its environment. The concept of sustainable consumption is a response to this. But the debates about sustainable consumption can only really be understood in the context of much wider and deeper debates about consumption and about consumer behavior itself. This article explores some of these wider debates. In particular, it draws attention to a fundamental disagreement that runs through the literature on consumption and haunts the debate on sustainable consumption: the question of whether, or to what extent, consumption can be taken as "good for us." Some approaches assume that increasing consumption is more or less synonymous with improved well-being: the more we consume the better off we are. Others argue, just as vehemently, that the scale of consumption in modern society is both environmentally and psychologically damaging, and that we could reduce consumption significantly without threatening the quality of our lives. This second viewpoint suggests that a kind of "double dividend" is inherent in sustainable consumption: the ability to live better by consuming less and reduce our impact on the environment in the process, In the final analysis, this article argues, such "win-win" solutions may exist but will require a concerted societal effort to realize.

AB This article argues that in the global North a successful path to sustainability will entail a stabilization of consumption through reductions in hours of work, a solution that neither ecologists nor economists have addressed seriously. The article presents data on the slowdown of hours reductions in many countries and discusses the need for policy intervention to counter firm-level disincentives to reducing hours of work. It then discusses the potential popularity of work-hour reductions with consumers. It ends with an argument that technological changes will be insufficient to achieve sustainable consumption patterns and that averting continued increases in the scale of consumption through trading income for time is imperative.

ID CYCLE ANALYSIS; TIME
AB Sustainable consumption is unlikely to be achieved as long as the quantity of household waste generated in industrial nations continues to rise. One factor underlying this trend is the life span of household goods. This article contributes to recent advances in life-cycle thinking by highlighting the significance of product life spans for sustainable consumption and exploring the current state of research. A theoretical model is developed to demonstrate how, by contributing to efficiency and sufficiency, longer product life spans may secure progress toward sustainable consumption, Empirical research undertaken in the United Kingdom on consumer attitudes and behavior relating to the life spans of household products is reviewed and factors that influence the market for longer-lasting products are discussed. A need is identified for further research on product life spans and some themes are proposed.

ID INPUT-OUTPUT APPROACH
AB A key challenge in attaining regional sustainability is to reduce both the direct and the indirect environmental impacts associated with economic and household activity in the region. Knowing what these flows are and how they change over time is a prerequisite for this task.
   This article describes the early development of an integrated regional materials flow accounting framework The framework is based on a hybrid (material and economic) multiregional input-output model. Using readily available economic and materials data sets together with transport and logistics data, the framework attempts to provide estimates of household resource flows for any U.K. region at quite detailed levels of product and material disaggregation. It is also capable of disaggregating these flows according to specific socioeconomic criteria such as income level or occupation of the head of household. Allied to appropriate energy and life-cycle assessment data sets, the model could, in addition, be used to map both direct and indirect environmental impacts associated with these flows.
   The benefits of such an approach are likely to be a considerable reduction of uncertainties in ( 1) our knowledge of the household metabolism, and hence our predictions of regional household waste generation; (2) our assessment of the impacts of contemplated changes in industrial process siting, and thereby on other aspects of local and regional planning; and (3) our understanding of the impacts of changes in the pattern of demand for different materials and products. It is concluded that the use of such an integrated assessment tool has much to contribute to the debate on regional sustainability.

AB Measures taken to protect the environment often have other, unintended effects on society. One concern is that changed behavior may offset part of the environmental gain, something that has variously been labeled "take-back" or "rebound." In energy economics, the rebound effect encompasses both the behavioral and systems responses to cost reductions of energy services as a result of energy efficiency measures. From an industrial ecology perspective, we are concerned about more than just energy use. Any given efficiency measure has several types of environmental impacts. Changes in the various impact indicators are not necessarily in the same direction. Both co-benefits and negative side effects of measures directed to solve one type of problem have been identified. Environment is often a free input, so that a price-based rebound effect is not expected, but other indirect effects not connected to the price, such as spillover of environmental behavior, also occur. If the costs and impact of products that are already environmentally friendly are reduced, the "rebound" can be in the opposite, desired direction. Furthermore, I identify technical spillover effects. Hence a number of related effects, often producing positive results, are not as well understood. Household environmental impact assessments and eco-efficiency assessments take into account the rebound effect, but they do not necessarily take into account these other effects. The analysis hence indicates that the current focus on the rebound effect is too narrow and needs to be extended to cover co-benefits, negative side effects, and spillover effects.

AB This article describes the integration of life-cycle assessment methods with a new input-output model of the world economy to analyze the environmental and economic implications of alternative future diets. The article reviews findings by industrial ecologists about the energy and land required for the production and consumption of alternative foods and diets in several European countries. It also reviews attributes of foods and diets identified by nutritionists as reducing the risks of obesity and major chronic diseases related to the diets of the affluent. The predominantly plant-based Mediterranean-type diet emerges as a dietary scenario that could satisfy both sets of concerns. The likely implications for, agriculture and for farm policies of a shift toward this diet from the current average diet in the United States are discussed and shown to be substantial. The one-country studies reviewed in the article provide substantial insights into the potential ramifications of dietary change. Many of the limitations of these studies could be overcome by conducting the analysis in a global framework that represented the relationships among consumption, production, and trade and the physical constraints within which they operate. Analysis of the environmental and economic implications of alternative scenarios describing healthy diets can help stimulate more intensive dialogue, debate, and action among the interested parties; such analysis can both benefit from and contribute to initiatives such as the World Health Organization's global strategy on diet and health, which intends to enlist the support of governments, corporations, and civil society.

AB This article analyzes nongovernmental organization (NGO) "market campaigns" that seek to motivate changes in global consumption and production patterns. Through campaigns targeting products as diverse as paper, shoes, and computers, advocacy groups seek to use existing concerns of consumers to influence producers, and simultaneously, to expand and deepen consumer demand for more sustainable products and services. NGOs deploy both negative information to critique leading brands, and positive information to help build new markets for improved products. Successful market campaigns construct networks of actors that identify points of leverage within global production and trading -egimes; coordinate research, exposure, direct action, and negotiations with brands; identify solutions; advance new multi-stakeholder standards and monitoring and certification schemes; build new nongovernmental regulatory institutions; and occasionally attempt to strengthen state regulation. Through an assessment of three market campaigns focused on Staples, Nike, and Dell, this article describes the nature of these campaigns, discusses how they function, assesses their central strategies and tactics, and they are actually having an impact. The article concludes by discussing the relevance and implications of these campaigns for the field of industrial ecology, and how industrial ecology might support future efforts to advance more sustainable producticn and consumption.

AB Input-output modeling is a useful tool for tracing environmental impacts of consumption. Because it includes impacts originating from production layers of infinite order (capturing the entire economy), input-output modeling is highly relevant for studies operating in a life-cycle context. In this article we show how the input-output approach can be used to enumerate the problem of sustainable consumption. Based on a literature survey including research done by the authors we present measures of the emissions of carbon dioxide at different spatial levels: nation, city, and household. Further, we take more environmental effects into account and introduce the concept of environmental efficiency by combining input-output modeling and data envelopment analysis. Finally, we discuss the policy relevance of the different measures. The article demonstrates that input-output modeling has a wide range of life-cycle oriented applications when combined with other data sources such as detailed trade statistics, foreign input-output and environmental statistics, and household expenditure data.

ID ENERGY
AB The extension of the waste input-output (WIO) model to analyze households' sustainable consumption patterns is presented in this article. We estimate direct and indirect emission loads induced by household consumption by the WIO model. The WIO model is much more suitable for the analysis of sustainable consumption than the conventional input-output model because it can deal with the disposal stage of consumed goods as well as the purchase and use stages. A simple method for evaluating income rebound effects is also introduced. As indicators of environmental loads, we estimate carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and landfill consumption induced by household consumption. The model is applied to some typical sustainable consumption scenarios: shifting transportation modes from a private car 70 public transportation, the longer use of household electric appliances, and eating at restaurants instead of cooking at home. We found that the income rebound effects should be considered to evaluate environmental loads induced by different consumption patterns.

ID GREENHOUSE-GAS EMISSIONS; SUSTAINABLE CONSUMPTION; FOOD
AB The objective of this article is to explore the potential for lowering household energy use given existing local support systems, in this case in the Stockholm inner city with the aid of the Dutch energy analysis program (EAP) that was adapted to Swedish conditions and that portrays total energy use for 300 consumption categories. Previously such modeling for Sweden was carried out using only Dutch databases. Our case-study area is well equipped with food stores, local markets, public transportation, and entertainment facilitating some energy-efficient consumption choices. With maintained expenditure levels but changed consumption patterns, current reduction potentials are on the order of 10-20%. Options concerning diet can lower food indirect energy use by up to 30%, whereas options in other areas have a lower potential. Further reductions will require enhanced local support systems, external as well as internal, The Results indicate that it is risky not to use nationally adapted figures for energy efficiency in the production sectors when modeling household energy use, because potential for change may be overlooked. Future work should include foreign energy intensities when modeling imported goods; otherwise, results may be less reliable. The Swedish EAP needs further work before it can be put to use as a modeling tool for everyday behavior, but it is already generating important possibilities for producing reliable data that can be used by local energy counselors.

AB Bringing about more sustainable consumption patterns is an important challenge for society and science. In this article the concept of household metabolism is applied to analyzing consumption patterns and to identifying possibilities for the development of sustainable household consumption patterns. Household metabolism is determined in terms of total energy requirements, including both direct and indirect energy requirements, using a hybrid method. This method enables us to evaluate various determinants of the environmental load of consumption consistently at several levels-the national level, the local level, and the household level.
   The average annual energy requirement of households varies considerably between the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Norway, and Sweden, as well as within these countries. The average expenditure level per household explains a large part of the observed variations. Differences between these countries are also related to the efficiency of the production sectors and to the energy supply system. The consumption categories of food, transport, and recreation show the largest contributions to the environmental load. A comparison of consumer groups with different household characteristics shows remarkable differences in the division of spending over the consumption categories,
   Thus, analyses of different types of households are important for providing a basis for options to induce decreases of the environmental load of household consumption. At the city level, options for change are provided by an analysis of the city infrastructure, which determines a large part of the direct energy use by households (for transport and heating). At the national level, energy efficiency in production and in electricity generation is an important trigger for decreasing household energy requirements.

AB Toxic heavy metals and metalloids, such as cadmium, lead, mercury, arsenic, and selenium, are constantly released into the environment. There is an urgent need to develop low-cost, effective, and sustainable methods for their removal or detoxification. Plant-based approaches, such as phytoremediation, are relatively inexpensive since they are performed in situ and are solar-driven. In this review, we discuss specific advances in plant-based approaches for the remediation of contaminated water and soil. Dilute concentrations of trace element contaminants can be removed from large volumes of wastewater by constructed wetlands. We discuss the potential of constructed wetlands for use in remediating agricultural drainage water and industrial effluent, as well as concerns over their potential ecotoxicity. In upland ecosystems, plants may be used to accumulate metals/metalloids in their harvestable biomass (phytoextraction). Plants can also convert and release certain metals/metalloids in a volatile form (phytovolatilization). We discuss how genetic engineering has been used to develop plants with enhanced efficiencies for phytoextraction and phytovolatilization. For example, metal-hyperaccumulating plants and microbes with unique abilities to tolerate, accumulate, and detoxify metals and metalloids represent an important reservoir of unique genes that could be transferred to fast-growing plant species for enhanced phytoremediation. There is also a need to develop new strategies to improve the acceptability of using genetically engineered plants for phytoremediation.

AB Functionalized compounds, which are difficult to produce by classical chemical synthesis, are of special interest as biotechnologically available targets. They represent useful building blocks for subsequent organic syntheses, wherein they can undergo stereoselective or regioselective reactions. "White Biotechnology" (as defined by the European Chemical Industry [http://www.europabio.org/white_biotech.htm], as part of a sustainable "Green Chemistry,") supports new applications of chemicals produced via biotechnology. Environmental aspects of this interdisciplinary combination include:
   -Use of renewable feedstock -Optimization of biotechnological processes by means of. -New "high performance" microorganisms - On-line mezasurement of substrates and products in bioreactors - Alternative product isolation, resulting in higher yields, and lower energy demand
   In this overview we describe biotechnologically produced pyruvic, 2-oxopentaric and 2-oxohexaric acids as promising new building blocks for synthetic chemistry. In the first part, the microbial formation of 2-oxocarboxylic acids (2-OCAs) in general, and optimization of the fermentation steps required to form pyruvic acid, 2-oxoglutaric acid, and 2-(OXO)-(D)-gluconic acid are described, highlighting the fundamental advantages in comparison to chemical syntheses. In the second part, a set of chemical formula schemes demonstrate that 2-OCAs are applicable as building blocks in the chemical synthesis of, e.g., hydrophilic triazines, spiro-connected heterocycles, benzotriazines, and pyranoic amino acids. Finally, some perspectives are discussed.

AB This paper examines the dynamics of current account adjustment among industrial countries. The purpose is to evaluate whether there is a threshold level of a current account deficit at which it becomes unsustainable and whether it is possible to characterize episodes of adjustment. We identify 25 episodes in which there was a sustained improvement in the current account following a large deficit between 1980 and 1997. We find that a typical cur-rent account reversal begins when the current account deficit is about 5% of GDP. However, we also find considerable cross-country variation in the reversal threshold, consistent with a stock-adjustment model of current account sustainability. Reversals are associated with slowing income growth and a 10-20% real exchange rate depreciation. Real export growth, declining investment, and an eventual leveling off in the budget deficit-GDP ratio are also likely to be part of the adjustment. These results imply that current account reversals in industrialized countries are related to the business cycle. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper offers reasoning for the endogenous sustainability of the National Minimum Wage Institution (NMWI). In an economy with asymmetries in productivity among unionized firms, high-tech firms may often opt for minimum wage agreements covering all unionized workers, in order to raise the relative costs of their rival low-tech firms. Their workers' unions as well as the unions of workers in low-tech firms share this interest, provided that the degree of product substitutability is not too low and the wage agreement is not too high. Hence, since economy-wide minimum wage agreements prove to be compatible with the interest of all unions and high-tech firms, the NMWI can be sustained in equilibrium under politically convenient circumstances.

AB Introduction: A systematic review was conducted to review the effectiveness of workplace-based return-to-work (RTW) interventions. Method: Seven databases were searched, in English and French, between January 1990 and December 2003 for peer-reviewed studies of RTW interventions provided at the workplace to workers with work disability associated with musculoskeletal or other pain-related conditions. Methodological quality appraisal and data extraction were conducted by pairs of reviewers. Results: Of a total of 4124 papers identified by the search, 10 studies were of sufficient quality to be included in the review. There was strong evidence that work disability duration is significantly reduced by work accommodation offers and contact between healthcare provider and workplace; and moderate evidence that it is reduced by interventions which include early contact with worker by workplace, ergonomic work site visits, and presence of a RTW coordinator. For these five intervention components, there was moderate evidence that they reduce costs associated with work disability duration. Evidence for sustainability of these effects was insufficient or limited. Evidence regarding the impact of supernumerary replacements was insufficient. Evidence levels regarding the impact of the intervention components on quality-of-life was insufficient or mixed. Conclusions: Our systematic review provides the evidence base supporting that workplace-based RTW interventions can reduce work disability duration and associated costs, however the evidence regarding their impact on quality-of-life outcomes was much weaker.

TI Paralysis over Palestine: Questions of strategy
SO JOURNAL OF PALESTINE STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
AB dThis essay by a prominent Israeli activist grows out of concern that ad; vocacy efforts in support of the Palestinian cause have remained stuck at the protest-informational stage of combating disparate manifestations of the occupation. What is needed, the author argues, is a strategy to mobilize the vast range of civil society groups-Palestinian, Israeli, and international-to forge an effective lobbying and advocacy force that can lend the Palestinian leadership public support and a measure of parity with Israel. Intended as a starting point for debate, the essay explores the possibilities of a "middle range" strategy that would articulate the essential "red line" elements crucial to any just and sustainable settlement, provide a coordinated strategy of advocacy, and explore a range of "endgames," including a regional approach to resolving the conflict if the "two-state solution" is found to be impossible because of irreversible facts on the ground."

AB Background: Methodological challenges such as recruitment problems and participant burden make clinical trials in palliative care difficult. In 2001-2004, two community-based randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of case conferences in palliative care settings were independently conducted in Australia-the Queensland Case Conferences trial (QCC) and the Palliative Care Trial (PCT).
   Design: A structured comparative study of the QCC and PCT was conducted, organized by known practical and organizational barriers to clinical trials in palliative care.
   Results: Differences in funding dictated study designs and recruitment success; PCT had 6 times the budget of QCC. Sample size attainment. Only PCT achieved the sample size goal. QCC focused on reducing attrition through gatekeeping while PCT maximized participation through detailed recruitment strategies and planned for significant attrition. Testing sustainable interventions. QCC achieved a higher percentage of planned case conferences; the QCC strategy required minimal extra work for clinicians while PCT superimposed conferences on normal work schedules. Minimizing participant burden. Differing strategies of data collection were implemented to reduce participant burden. QCC had short survey instruments. PCT incorporated all data collection into normal clinical nursing encounters. Other. Both studies had acceptable withdrawal rates. Intention-to-treat analyses are planned. Both studies included substudies to validate new outcome measures.
   Conclusions: Health service interventions in palliative care can be studied using RCTs. Detailed comparative information of strategies, successes and challenges can inform the design of future trials. Key lessons include adequate funding, recruitment focus, sustainable interventions, and mechanisms to minimize participant burden.

AB Antimony acrylate (SbAc) was synthesized and used to modify linseed oil based polyesteramide in three molar ratios. IR, H-1-NMR spectroscopic techniques and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) were used to characterize the SbAc modified polyesteramide resin (Sb-PEA). The films of Sb-PEA were applied on mild steel strips of standard sizes to study their coating properties. The physicochemical, physico-mechanical and anticorrosive behaviour of these coatings were evaluated by standard methods. It was found that the Sb-PEA coatings showed improved physico-mechanical and corrosion resistance performance in various corrosive media as compared to those of plain polyesteramide.

TI Perceptions of local health care quality in 7 rural communities with
   telemedicine
SO JOURNAL OF RURAL HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
ID CONSULTATION
AB Context: Rural health services are difficult to maintain because of low patient volumes, limited numbers of providers, and unfavorable economics of scale. Rural patients may perceive poor quality in local health care, directly impacting the sustainability of local health care services. Purpose: This study examines perceptions of local health care quality in 7 rural, underserved communities where telemedicine was implemented. This study also assesses factors associated with travel outside of local communities for health care services. Methods: Community-based pretelemedicine and posttelemedicine random telephone surveys were conducted in 7 northern California rural communities assessing local residents' perceptions of health care quality and the frequency of travel outside their community for health care services. Five-hundred rural residents were interviewed in each of the pretelemedicine and posttelemedicine surveys. Between surveys, telemedicine services were made available in each of the communities. Findings: Residents aware of telemedicine services in their community had a significantly higher opinion of local health care quality (P =.002). Satisfaction with telemedicine was rated high by both rural providers and patients. Residents with lower opinions of local health care quality were more likely to have traveled out of their community for medical care services (P =.014). Conclusions: The introduction of telemedicine into rural communities is associated with increases in the local coin in unities' perception of local health care quality. Therefore, is it possible that telemedicine may result in a decrease in the desire and need for local patients to travel. outside of their community for health care services.

AB The running velocities associated to lactate minimum (V-lm), heart rate deflection (V-HRd), critical velocity (CV), 3000 M (V-3000) and 10000 m performance (V-10km) were compared. Additionally the ability of V-lm and VHRd on identifying sustainable velocities was investigated.
   Methods. Twenty runners (28.5 +/- 5.9 y) performed 1) 3000 m running test for V3000; 2) an all-out 500 in sprint followed by 6x800 m incremental bouts with blood lactate ([lac]) measurements for V-lm; 3) a continuous velocity-incremented test with heart rate measurements at each 200 m for V-HRd; 4) participants attempted to 30 min of endurance test both at V-lm(ETVlm) and V-HRd(ETVHRd). Additionally, the distance-time and velocity-1/time relationships produced CV by 2 (500 m and 3000 m) or 3 predictive trials (500 m, 3000 m and distance reached before exhaustion during ETVHRd), and a 10 km race was recorded for V-10km.
   Results. The CV identified by different methods did not differ to each other. The results (m(.)min(-1)) revealed that V-.(lm) (281 +/- 14.8)< CV (292.1 +/- 17.5)=V-10km (291.7 +/- 19.3)< V-HRd (300.8 +/- 18.7)=V-3000 (304 +/- 17.5) with high correlation among parameters (P < 0.001). During ETVlm participants completed 30 min of running while on the ETVHRd they lasted only 12.5 +/- 8.2 min with increasing [lac].
   Conclusion. We evidenced that CV and Vim track-protocols are valid for running evaluation and performance prediction and the parameters studied have different significance. The V-lm reflects the moderate-high intensity domain (below CV), can be sustained without [lac] accumulation and may be used for long-term exercise while the V-HRd overestimates a running intensity that can be sustained for long-time. Additionally, V-3000 and V-HRd reflect the severe intensity domain (above CV).

AB The traditional leather industry is far from sustainable. Therefore, many new leather-making processes, so called 'cleaner technologies', have been proposed to reduce the levels of pollutant emission. The objective of this study is to make an environmental impact evaluation of such processes not only based on the quantity of wastes generated but also on the wastewater treatability. This paper is mainly concerned with the settleability of wastewater. Such an evaluation might be of great significance due to the enormous amount of wastewater and increased treatment costs. The research is typified by enzyme assisted soaking and unhairing (ESU) processes that are encouraged in beamhouse processes for protecting the environment. The chemical sedimentation behavior of ESU wastewater and the wastewater generated by conventional soaking and unhairing (CSU) processes are described and compared with each other. It was found that ESU wastewater showed better sedimentation property than CSU wastewater, indicating that the enzyme assisted soaking and unhairing processes have environmental friendliness in terms of wastewater settleability.

AB As natural-resource-based economies continue to change, local planning will play a pivotal part in managing their transition. This research examines the role played by planning in defining a vision of sustainability in two such communities in the Canadian Pacific Northwest. The case studies are important in several respects: they illustrate that sustainability can be an important organizing theme in planning a community's response to change; they show that through planning, concepts of sustainability can evolve from individual to collective definitions; and they illustrate planning-based efforts to manage change. In the communities examined here, planners played an especially influential role in the transition process: they helped define possibilities.

AB The separation of the base flow component from a varying streamflow hydrograph is called "hydrograph analysis," In this study, two digital filter based separation modules, the BFLOW and Eckhardt filters, were incorporated into the Web based Hydrograph Analysis Tool (WHAT) system. A statistical component was also developed to provide fundamental information for flow frequency analysis and time series analysis. The Web Geographic Information System (GIS) version of the WHAT system accesses and uses U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) daily streamflow data from the USGS web server. The results from the Eckhardt filter method were compared with the results from the BFLOW filter method that was previously validated, since measured base flow data were not available for this study. Following validation, the two digital filter methods in the WHAT system were run for 50 Indiana gaging stations. The Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient values comparing the results of the two digital filter methods were over 0.91 for all 50 gaging stations, suggesting the filtered base flow using the Eckhardt filter method will typically match measured base flow. Manual separation of base flow from streamflow can lead to inconsistency in the results, while the WHAT system provides consistent results in less than a minute. Although base flow separation algorithms in the WHAT system cannot consider reservoir release and snowmelt that can affect stream hydrographs, the Web based WHAT system provides an efficient tool for hydrologic model calibration and validation. The base flow information from the WHAT system can also play an important role for sustainable ground water and surface water exploitation, including irrigation and industrial uses, and estimation of pollutant loading from both base flow and direct runoff. Thus, best management practices can be appropriately applied to reduce and intercept pollutant leaching if base flow contributes significant amounts of pollutants to the stream. This Web GIS based system also demonstrates how remote, distributed resources can be shared through the Internet using Web programming.

   decommissioning
AB The loss of the world's reservoir capacity to sedimentation can be mitigated by altering dam operations to release sediment downstream. However, legal uncertainty regarding whether dam owners are liable for damages to surrounding landowners due to altered operations provides a significant disincentive for sustainable sediment management. Past work recommends that courts apply a "rule of reasonableness" in assessing liability: dam owners should be held liable for damages only if they act unreasonably in altering operations, and surrounding landowners should take reasonable measures to mitigate foreseeable damage. Based on past cases, judicial determinations of reasonable reservoir management and reasonable precautionary measures by landowners are generally highly speculative, controversial, and based on limited information. Courts can ease the future burden of making these difficult determinations with rulings that create economic incentives for parties to act reasonably. For example, courts might entitle landowners to be free from sediment related damages, and protect the entitlement with a liability rule. This gives dam owners an economic incentive to release sediment only if the benefits of doing so outweigh court ordered damages to landowners. Past judicial decisions are largely consistent with this legal regime.

AB The green chemistry revolution provides an enormous number of oppourtunities to discover and apply new synthetic approaches using alternative feedstocks; ecofriendly reaction conditions, energy minimizations and the design of less toxic and inherently safer chemicals. The origin and basis of green chemistry chart for achieving environmental and economic prosperity inherent in a sustainable world. One important element of sustainable chemistry is commonly defined as the chemical research aiming at the optimization of chemical processes and products with respect to energy and material consumption, inherent safety, toxicity, environmental degradability, and so on. While considerable progress has been made in environmental chemistry, green chemistry, and the environmental assessment of chemical products but the societal aspect of sustainable chemistry remains to be recognized fully in all branches of chemical research, one prerequisite for this is the inclusion of sustainable chemistry into chemical education from the very beginning.

AB Sediment from harbors of the Emilia-Romagna (Northern Adriatic Sea) were dredged and dumped in four disposal areas characterized by muddy bottoms. The long-term effects of the dumping on macrozoobenthic communities were investigated before and after 6 month, 8 month, 2 years and 4 years. The disposal of dredged material did not influence the granulometry and %TOC in the sediment, and no alterations in the structure of the macrobenthic communities were observed in the four areas. The lack of impact could be ascribed to the environmental characteristics and precautionary measures taken to minimize the effects of the dumping. It appears that: (1) the communities of the dumping areas are well adapted to unstable environments; (2) the sediments were disposed gradually and homogeneously over relatively large areas; Other factors that help to reduce the impact of sediment disposal are the low concentrations of contaminants in dredged materials and the similarity of sediment in the dredged and disposal areas. Off-shore discharge appears a sustainable strategy for the management of uncontaminated dredged sediments from the Northern Adriatic Sea harbors. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID INTEGRATED COASTAL MANAGEMENT
AB The 1998 project ECOPORT, "Towards A Sustainable Transport Network", developed by the Valencia Port Authority (VPA), established the bases for implementing an Environmental Management System (EMS) in industrial harbours. The use of data and information shall always be required to develop an efficient EMS. The objective of the present research (INDAPORT) study is to propose a system of sustainable environmental management indicators to be used by any port authorities. All activities performed within a port area are analysed for any potential environmental impacts and risks.
   An environmental analysis of port activities has been carried out with the objective of designing the indicators system. Twenty-one corresponding activities have been identified for large industrial ports. Subsequently, the same methodology developed to date will be later applied to other Spanish and European ports. The study has been developed by using an original system and a methodology, which simultaneously use stage diagrams and systemic models (material and energy flow charts). Multi-criteria analysis techniques were used to evaluate potential impacts (identification of factors and evaluation of impacts). (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

DT Article
ID IMPACT-WEAR
AB The increase of live steam temperature and pressure in new steam power plants is certainly the most effective measure to realize the stipulated CO(2) reduction targets for the conventional power industry.
   The development of new materials becomes a key challenge on the way forward to a more efficient and sustainable power generation. There are two approaches being followed in materials technology in order to facilitate higher steam temperatures and pressures in the water steam cycle:
   1.) The development of new materials.
   2.) The use of oxidation resistant coatings on currently available materials with higher creep strength but inferior steam oxidation resistance.
   Both approaches are currently being followed in several R&D projects worldwide.
   The development and qualification of coatings is complementary to the development of new materials. The object of the EC funded R&D project SUPERCOAT is the development of new coatings according to the second approach. Eight partners from five European countries participate in the work. SUPERCOAT is the first R&D project of its kind in Europe.
   This presentation covers the project targets, the efforts carried out while exploring the suitability of coatings for steam turbine components and the actual state of the work. As far as possible, an excerpt from the main results of coating development and lab testing will be presented. Additionally the applied deposition techniques, chosen according to practical criteria will be presented and applicability to certain components will be discussed.
   Complementary, the author will report on the efforts, carried out in the German Ministry of Economic Affairs funded project "KONET". In this field test, empirical data are being gained from a real operating power plant and can be compared with data from the SUPERCOAT lab tests.
   Finally, the next steps in the project SUPERCOAT will be presented and applicability of the coatings will be evaluated.

AB One of the gravest environmental problems facing us today is how to manage materials we use and produce as a result of the industrial development in the 20th century. The concept of ecomaterials was proposed with their full life-cycle taken into consideration in 1991 and has widely developed now. There have been many governmental activities for the creation of sustainable society in Japan such as enactments of environmental laws and regulations. Many Japanese enterprises have been also engaged in a lot of activities for environmental protection. Owing to their endeavour, ecomaterials in Japan have been developed and their number has increased yearly. The research was made on how ecomaterials are currently used in Japan. All the information was obtained from the Web-sites 2004 year version environmental reports of the organizations concerned. In this paper, ecomaterials produced by two hundred and sixty six listed companies on the stock market were researched and classified into six categories. About 3900 ecomaterials were found in the 2004 year version environmental reports of 266 companies researched, whereas the number of ecomaterials researched in the year 2001 was only 1898 in 286 companies and in the year 2003 about 3700 in 281 companies. This means the number of ecomaterials in Japan in the year 2003 nearly doubled compared to that of 2001 and increased further in 2004. It also indicates the realization on the part of Japanese companies of the importance of ecomaterials resulting in the advancement of related research activities. Higher materials efficiency products of user friendly, energy saving and high performance type, which are the results of years of engineering research and development are being promoted as newly improved and efficient products. It seems that the time is approaching when it is necessary to consider as a part of environmental problems the limited availability of natural resources and to promote a sustainable society from a broader perspective.

AB Fuel cells are often seen as a long-term solution to environmental problems such as CO2 emission associated with transportation. To ensure long-term sustainability and the supply of fuel, new renewable of hydrogen (H-2) generator have to be introduced. In this study, Ni-rich AZ91D magnesium alloy ingot, which was considered as waste material, was used as a H-2 generator in sodium chloride (NaCl) solution with catalyst. The chemical reaction Mg + H2O -> H-2 + Mg(OH)(2) Occurred in NaCl aqueous solution. The H-2 evolution rate depended on the solution's temperature (25 or 70 degrees C), length of catalyst (0.9 or 1.8 m) and the concentration of NaCl solution (5 or 10 mass%). The H-2 evolution rate increased with increasing the solution's temperature. The catalyst (Pt wire) could significantly improve the H-2 generation rate. In addition, the by-product of this method is Mg(OH)(2), a non-toxic chemical compound which is usually used as flame retardant.

TI AMEE education guide no. 28: The development and role of departments of
   medical education
SO MEDICAL TEACHER
LA English
DT Article
ID TEACHER
AB A department of medical education is becoming an essential requirement for a medical school. This publication is intended for those wishing to establish or develop a medical education department. It may also prove useful to teachers in medicine by providing information on how such a department can support their activities. This will vary with the local context but the principles, are generalizable. Medical education departments are established in response to increased public expectations relating to healthcare, societal trends towards increased accountability, educational developments, increased interest in what to teach and how to educate doctors and the need to train more doctors. The functions of a department of medical education include research, teaching, service provision and career development of the staff. The scope of its activities includes undergraduate and postgraduate education, continuing professional development and continuing medical education. These activities may be extended to other healthcare professions. Flexibility is the key to staffing a department of medical education. Various contractual arrangements, affiliations and support from non-affiliated personnel are needed to provide a multi professional team with a range of expertise. The precise structure of the department will depend on the individual institution. The name of the department may suggest its position within the university structure. The director provides academic leadership for the department and his/her responsibilities include promotion of staff collaboration, fostering career development of the staff and establishing local, regional and international links. Financial support may come from external funding agencies, government or university sources. Some departments of medical education are financially self-supporting. The department should be closely integrated with the medical school. Support for the department from the dean is an essential factor for sustainability. Several case studies of medical education departments throughout the world are included as examples of the different roles and functions of a department of medical education.

AB Teak (Tectona grandis Linn. f) is a hardwood species of worldwide reputation. It occurs naturally in India, Thailand, Myanmar and Laos. Fifteen highly polymorphic microsatellite loci were developed from a genomic library enriched for AG/TC repeats. Primers to amplify these loci were tested on 265 individual trees from different teak populations. An average of 14.7 alleles per locus were detected and expected heterozygosity ranged from 0.223 to 0.879. These loci constitute a powerful tool in investigating the mating system, gene flow, parentage analysis and population dynamics for use in sustainable management of teak forests and for in situ conservation purposes.

AB The potential exists for New Zealand to exploit already established markets for razor clams through development of fisheries or aquaculture industries for the New Zealand razor clam, Zenatia acinaces. However, fishery or aquaculture development for Z. acinaces requires an understanding of the reproductive cycle including the timing of gametogenic development and spawning. The reproductive cycle of Z. acinaces was studied over an 11-month period from May 2000 to March 2001 at Kennedy Bay, Coromandel Peninsula, using qualitative standard histological analysis and quantitative measures of oocytes. Histological analysis indicated that Z. acinaces is dioecious and gametogenic development was synchronous between the sexes. Gametogenesis began in June with gametes maturing quickly and by August/Sept ember (late winter/ early spring) most razor clams were ripe. Spawning began as early as September (spring) although spawning mainly occurred during October. By December (summer), nearly all clams were completely spent. From January 2001 most clams could not be sexed as all residual gametes were resorbed. Razor clams remained in this stage during March 2001. Spawning began when the water temperature was around its lowest, c. 15 degrees C. Monthly mean number of eggs/follicle was sensitive to changes in reproductive development, closely following Patterns observed in the qualitative stagings. Patterns of monthly mean oocyte diameters did not adequately describe the spawning events observed in qualitative analyses. Sex ratios were equal over the size range (69-99 mm shell length) of clams that could be sexed. The data presented in this study provide valuable information on the timing of spawning events for Z. acinaces, necessary for developing sustainable management strategies and selecting broodstock for aquaculture.

AB Twenty-seven public timber tracts were auctioned in Minnesota where bidders were required to submit two sealed bids for a tract-one with and the other without the use of timber harvesting guidelines. After the auctions, bidders were mailed a questionnaire requesting information about their logging business, the sources of information consulted in developing their bids, and perceptions of how various tract- and sale-specific factors and guidelines influenced their bidding behavior The majority of responding timber harvesters did not consult any special sources and only one-half visited the tract before submitting their bids. Although bidding behavior was influenced by several factors, a tract's physical characteristics (e.g., volume of merchantable timber) had a greater influence on their bidding behavior than did any guidelines. Of the guidelines evaluated, those that required leaving merchantable trees (e.g., for ivildlife, or visual purposes) were reported to have the greatest influence on stumpage bids. Sale-specific variables (e.g., timber harvester's need for timber) had only a minimal to moderate influence on bidding behavior. The findings suggest that timber sale design can help mitigate the cost associated with implementing forest management guidelines.

AB Nurse-managed health centers are critical safety net providers. Increasing support of these centers is a promising strategy for the federal government to reduce health disparities. To continue as safety net providers, nurse-managed health centers need to receive equal compensation as other federally funded providers. Ultimately, the long-term sustainability of nurse-managed centers rests on prospective payments or similar federally mandated funding mechanisms.

AB Community-based nurse-managed practice (CBNMP) brings primary health care to local, typically vulnerable, populations. Despite cost-effective, high quality care, a 21% decline in academic CBNMPs was documented in the 1990s. A multiple case study addressed factors that hindered or facilitated diffusion and sustainabitity of CBNMPs in prevalent practice settings. To promote sustainable practice, CBNMPs should articulate a practice mission, identify the practice as nursing, create a team approach, balance mission with margin, and promote attractive sites. Other recommendations 'include planning for growth mid evolution of health care and applying for awards to increase die visibility and political clout of CBNMPs.

AB We compared the potential for compensatory growth of two grass species from the Mongolian steppe that differ in their ability to persist under grazing: the rhizomatous Leymus chinensis and the caespitose Stipa krylovii, and investigated how this ability might be affected by drought. Plants were grown in a greenhouse under wet and dry conditions and subjected to a clipping treatment (biweekly removal of 75-90% of the aerial mass). Leymus exhibited a much stronger compensatory growth after clipping than Stipa. Leymus showed a significant increase in its relative growth rate (RGR) after clipping, while for Stipa RGR was negatively affected. Clipped Leymus plants maintained leaf productivity levels that were similar to undamaged individuals, while leaf-productivity in clipped Stipa dropped to less than half of that of the controls. In Leytrus, there was less compensatory growth under dry than under wet conditions, while in Stipa the compensation was increased under drought. This difference probably reflects the fact that Stipa is more drought-tolerant than Leymus. The greater compensatory growth of Leymus compared to Stipa mainly resulted from a greater stimulation of its net assimilation rate (NAR), and its greater capacity to store and reallocate carbohydrates by clipping. The greater increase in NAR was probably the result of a stronger reduction in self-shading, because Leymits shoots were much denser than those of Stipa, which resulted in a higher increase in light penetration to remaining leaves after clipping. The results of this study suggest that the greater ability of Leymus to persist under grazing is the result of its larger capacity for compensatory growth.

AB Land-use change for human settlement and agricultural purposes, especially pasture establishment, has caused major impacts on the Amazon Basin's environment. Development of strategies for reformation and restoration of already degraded pastures constitutes the main goal of the authors' research work. For some of this work, a homogeneous area of land in terms of soil characteristics was selected at Nova Vida ranch in Rondonia state to conduct a multidisciplinary experiment, which included agronomic, environmental and economic analyses. Since July 2001, the authors have monitored five treatments: control, herbicide, tillage, no-till rice and no-till soybean, arranged in four blocks. Early results on carbon and nitrogen stocks, nitrogen mineralization, trace-gas fluxes, dissolved organic carbon and microbial biomass are briefly presented.

TI The vegetable export system - A role model for local vegetable
   production in Kenya
SO OUTLOOK ON AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
DE vegetable production; export sector; poverty reduction; Kenya
AB Vegetables are important crops in developing countries, recognized for their nutritional benefits and income generation for smallholder farmers. This paper compares the successful vegetable export system with the much larger but inefficient and low-yielding local vegetable subsector in Kenya and identifies opportunities to address the major technical and marketing constraints faced by the local subsector. The export system could be a useful role model for the development of improved, adapted vegetable varieties, sustainable seed-delivery systems, organized technical assistance and more efficient marketing systems in the local subsector. A productive and efficient local vegetable system is likely to enhance the livelihoods of the poor and economic growth in Kenya.

AB The decision-making process of farmers in the Spanish Mediterranean regions was analysed using the function of Multi-Attribute Utility Theory (MAUT). The economic, agronomic and social repercussions resulting from adopting a series of technological and structural improvements were evaluated on farms with citricultural and outdoor horticultural production. The introduction of such measures is necessary to improve competitiveness and favour the sustainability of these farms. The outstanding consequences of these innovations were a more efficient use of irrigation water and an increase in the area of vegetable cultivation when mechanized, which counteracted the overwhelming trend in the area towards citriculture.

DE beef cattle; biodiversity; decoupling; environmental allowances;

AB There is apprehension that the decoupling of EU income support will result in shortages of livestock for preservation of biodiversity in Swedish seminatural pastures. However, in a region studied in British Columbia with natural conditions similar to those in central Sweden but with no income support, one-third of the agricultural land is semi-natural pastures and the number of beef cattle has increased. This can be explained by the availability of cheap outdoor wintering of cattle and low opportunity cost of land. The results suggest that the abolition of income support and the tradition of expensive indoor wintering, but maintained environmental allowance for grazing, would result in land use in large parts of Sweden similar to that in the British Columbia region.

AB Livestock industries in developing countries face numerous constraints that have often hampered the establishment and sustainability of national genetic improvement programmes. One major inadequacy in a number of programmes previously developed was that livestock owners were not taken into account in decision making and ownership of improvement initiatives. No matter how much effort is put into financial and technological support, the eventual survival of improvement programmes depends on whether the farmers understood and agreed with the objective of the projects. Otherwise, programmes tend to fade away as soon as the development agencies leave. Community ownership of genetic-improvement programmes has been suggested as a potentially sustainable alternative. In this paper, the establishment and sustainability of community-based organizations for the genetic improvement of livestock (CBOGIL) are discussed with reference to some successful community-based genetic-improvement initiatives in different livestock species.

AB In this paper we analyse counter-cyclical fiscal policy within the context of a microfounded analysis of business-cycle stabilization. We show that tax and spending instruments can have a useful counter-cyclical role, even after allowing for the distortionary nature of the instruments and the need for debt sustainability. A critical barrier to the use of fiscal instruments may be political economy concerns, and we survey recent suggestions involving alternative fiscal policy institutions.

TI Fiscal policy in EMU: Towards a sustainability and growth pact?
SO OXFORD REVIEW OF ECONOMIC POLICY
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper takes stock of the academic and policy discussions on the fiscal institutions of EMU confronts the framework in place with what is known of the desirable properties of fiscal policy in a monetary union, and discusses possible improvements. We start with a discussion of three requirements for the fiscal framework of a monetary union: it should be conducive to public finance sustainability, leave room for stabilization at the national level, and encourage structural reform. We then examine how the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) measures up to these requirements and find that it has mostly failed on all three accounts. Whether the 2005 reform of the SGP fixes those deficiencies remains an open issue. To this end, we propose five building blocks towards an effective SGP: a better concept of sustainability harmonized general government balance sheets; appropriate targets; refined procedures; and better institutions.

AB Soil suspension in the Cidanau River of western Java, Indonesia, has increased recently, perhaps because of rapid environmental change in this watershed region. The objectives of this research are to assess soil loss risk using remote sensing and GIS and to develop effective guidelines for soil conservation in this watershed. To assess soil loss risk, a new soil loss model based on Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) was applied, in which C factor (crop management factor) was estimated using the perpendicular vegetation index (PVI); this was computed with satellite remote sensing data and used to simulate soil loss risk. The simulation showed that areas with highest risk of soil loss are on northern- and southern-facing hillsides with poor vegetation. Guidelines for soil conservation in the watershed were proposed: under these guidelines soil-loss risk is managed by evaluating the effectiveness of contour farming, belt farming, and mulch farming. Some recommended measures for soil conservation are as follows: (1) Green vegetation cover should be preserved as much as possible. (2) Vegetation coverage must be increased by forestation in steep sloped areas. (3) Belt farming and contour farming are recommended in areas with slopes under 100%, and mulch farming (more than 50% ground cover mulching is recommended) is desirable in areas with slopes over 100% and without green cover.

AB The Australian farming sector is continuing to intensify, particularly within 300 km of the east and southern coastlines. In the future there will be fewer and larger farms, which will use more fertilizer, support more stock, grow more monoculture crops, and utilise more marginal soils. This is likely to increase the major environmental impacts of soil degradation, salt, nutrient and sediment contamination of waterways, and greenhouse gas emissions. Australian national water policy continues to focus on land, stream and groundwater salinity issues, although there is now a greater recognition of the importance of nitrogen and phosphorus losses from agriculture. The general philosophy of policy for dealing with nonpoint source pollution has been towards a voluntary rather than regulatory approach, with state and national governments supporting a range of programs to encourage sustainable agricultural practices. A catchment (watershed) based approach, through the use of integrated catchment management plans, is the primary way that non-point source pollution is addressed at the farm and local level. At an industry level, cotton, grains, meat, sugarcane and dairy amongst others, as well as the Australian fertilizer industry, have responded to non-point source issues by investing in research and development, and developing codes of practice aimed at abating these environmental impacts. Understanding the economic, social, political and cultural contexts of farming as well as the environmental impacts of agriculture are very important in determining the appropriateness of policy responses for Australian farming systems.

AB In the 21st century, mankind has witnessed great advances in life sciences, including completion of the Arabidopsis thaliana genome sequence and major advances with the rice genome. But, along with global economic development, urbanization, and depletion of natural resources, many serious problems are emerging (for example, environment, food, population, energy), which reinforce the need for sustainable development in many countries and in many institutions and prompt progress in life sciences globally. Plants offer the globe its only renewable resource of food, building material, and energy. Plants have highly sophisticated, concerted, short- and long-term adaptive mechanisms to the environment. Plants have great importance in global sustainable economic development. Plant molecular biology is a most essential and powerful tool in this process. Globally, plant molecular biology research is progressing rapidly, from use of model plants to cereal crops and from cellular processes to evolutionary mechanisms. Results of these studies have value in ecosystem regulation and environmental phytoremediation. China is a large agricultural country with one-fifth of the world's population. The gap for the level of plant molecular biology research in China is large, compared with that in other developed nations. However, some Chinese laboratories (notably those of academicians Jiayang Li, Zhihong Xu, Zhensheng Li, Mengmin Hong, Qifa Zhang and professors Yongbiao Xue, Shouyi Chen, and Zhen Zhu) have kept pace with international developments in plant molecular biology. How to fully utilize plant biodiversity in China requires future advances in plant molecular biology. This minireview discusses opportunities and challenges in plant molecular biology in China, analyzes the current status of international plant molecular biology, and provides suggestions to accelerate and advance international efforts.

AB Lipaphis erysimi, commonly known as mustard aphid is a seriously damaging pest of important oilseed crop, Brassica juncea. In previous study we reported using artificial diet bioassay that: Allium sativum leaf lectin, ASAL shows insecticidal activity against sap sucking L. erysimi. A gut receptor protein having binding affinity to ASAL was purified from L. erysimi. The receptor protein was further identified as a SymL, playing role in aphid mediated virus transmission. To develop resistance against the above pest, ASAL had been expressed in mustard both in constitutive and phloem tissue specific manner. Stable integration and inheritance of ASAL gene has been shown through Southern hybridization. Expression of ASAL has been confirmed in T-0 and T-1 plants through northern and western blot analyses. The segregation pattern of ASAL transgene and hygromycin selection marker gene were observed in T-1 progenies which followed the 3:1 Mendelian ratio. The phloem tissue specific expression of ASAL gene driven by rice sucrose synthase promoter (RSs-1) has also been monitored by immunohistochemical analysis of mature stem and petiole sections. In-planta bioassays on T-0 plants and their progenies exhibited the efficacy of expressed ASAL to reduce the survival and fecundity of L. erysimi. This is the first report showing sustainable resistance in transgenic B. juncea with ASAL gene against the target pest, mustard aphid. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The concept of using higher plants to maintain a sustainable life support system for humans during long-duration space missions is dependent upon photosynthesis. The effects of extended exposure to microgravity on the development and functioning of photosynthesis at the leaf and stand levels were examined onboard the International Space Station (ISS). The PESTO (Photosynthesis Experiment Systems Testing and Operations) experiment was the first long-term replicated test to obtain direct measurements of canopy photosynthesis from space under well-controlled conditions. The PESTO experiment consisted of a series of 21-24 day growth cycles of Triticum aestivum L. cv. USU Apogee onboard ISS. Single leaf measurements showed no differences in photosynthetic activity at the moderate (up to 600 mu mol m(-2)s(-1)) light levels, but reductions in whole chain electron transport, PSII, and PSI activities were measured under saturating light (> 2,000 mu mol m(-2)s(-1)) and CO2 (4000 mu mol mol(-1)) conditions in the microgravity-grown plants. Canopy level photosynthetic rates of plants developing in microgravity at similar to 280 mu mol m(-2)s(-1)were not different from ground controls. The wheat canopy had apparently adapted to the microgravity environment since the CO2 compensation (121 vs. 118 mu mol mol(-1)) and PPF compensation (85 vs. 81 mu mol m(-2)s(-1)) of the flight and ground treatments were similar. The reduction in whole chain electron transport (13%), PSII (13%), and PSI (16%) activities observed under saturating light conditions suggests that microgravity-induced responses at the canopy level may occur at higher PPF intensity.

AB Claims to the inadequacy of GDP growth as an indicator of well-being improvement are widespread. Yet the notion of well-being is very broad, hence difficult to quantify, so alternative indexes (e.g., ISEW, GPI) may also be deficient. This article approaches well-being from a multi-dimensional perspective which, unlike earlier attempts to incorporate inequality and environmental variables, focuses especially on "ecological inequality," or inequality in the distribution of the social cost associated with resource depletion. A methodology for assessing well-being improvements is developed, one which includes an accounting for ecological inequality, and is applied to four countries: Brazil, Costa Rica, Indonesia, and the Philippines. The variability in the results strongly suggests that in addition to depending on the subjective perspective of the policymaker regarding the relative importance of the income growth realized by different population groups, well-being assessments depend critically on the existing ecological distribution. More research into quantifying ecological distribution is therefore warranted. Absent significant progress in this area, sensitivity analysis such as that conducted here may inform policy better than GDP or alternative well-being indexes or aggregates.

DE environment; hydrology & water resources; management
AB The management of shared watercourses in an integrated and sustainable manner has been a developmental process which has evolved through national, river basin and regional efforts in southern Africa. The countries constituting the Southern African Development Community (SADC) have realised and recognised that the most efficient way of utilising shared watercourses and practising the principles of integrated water resources management is a basin-wide approach. This requires international cooperation, appropriate protocols and agreements to be put in place, as well as appropriate management institutions. This paper follows the developmental process in the management of shared watercourses in the SADC region, highlighting the strategies adopted, how appropriate they are, and the achievements so far attained. The opinions and conclusions drawn in the paper are those of the author.

TI Socially sensitive regulation for water services
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF CIVIL ENGINEERS-WATER MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE social impact; waste management and disposal; water supply
AB The provision of essential services such as water and sanitation may be considered a first step towards social inclusion. The overall sustainability of water and sanitation services also depends on social considerations. This paper explores the relationship between the regulator and the utility in the context of service provision for low-income users. It presents a general background to regulation in the water sector, along with some of the challenges faced by governments and regulators when implementing private sector involvement. Drawing upon the authors' experience of water services management including regulation and private sector participation (PSP) in the water sector, the paper is based on a review of the literature, discussion with relevant professionals and an examination of a number of projects. The authors detail the role of the regulator and identify recurring themes relating to regulation and the poor. The shortcomings of specific projects are highlighted not as criticisms, but in the interest of sharing of knowledge and improving services to the poor in the long run. The paper includes suggestions on how regulation of water services could be undertaken in a low-income environment. The authors conclude that if water utilities are to perform in a socially sensitive manner, appropriate regulatory regimes are necessary.

AB Operations management researchers and practitioners face new challenges in integrating issues of sustainability with their traditional areas of interest. During the past 20 years, there has been growing pressure on businesses to pay more attention to the environmental and resource consequences of the products and services they offer and the processes they deploy. One symptom of this pressure is the movement towards triple bottom line reporting (3BL) concerning the relationship of profit, people, and the planet. The resulting challenges include integrating environmental, health, and safety concerns with green-product design, lean and green operations, and closed-loop supply chains. We review these and other "sustainability" themes covered in the first 50 issues of Production and Operations Management and conclude with some thoughts on future research challenges in sustainable operations management.

TI For a productive and sustainable sheep breeding on rangeland: an
   experimental system on the Causse du Larzac
SO PRODUCTIONS ANIMALES

ID LAMBS
AB Efficient animal production together with environmental care, are both the global goals of the sheep production system reported here. The challenge was to succeed in establishing a perennial system of lamb production with prolific ewes fed mainly from dry steppic rangeland resources from a calcareous area of the south part of France.
   A long term experiment was settled at the INRA Domaine de La Fage on the Causse du Larzac (44 degrees N - 3 degrees E; 800 in a.s.l.) in order to find a suitable animal breed and to elaborate management rules both for the sheep living outside and for innovative pastoral use of a spontaneous pasture. A multidisciplinary programme was developed according to the following objectives : i) reach the highest feeding autonomy from the rangeland grass, ii) succeed in the year to year renewal of the pasture, iii) achieve good growth rates for twin suckled lambs, iv) protect the countryside and maintain plant diversity, and v) limit inputs and costs.
   In this context, suckling ewes of the INRA 401 breed are reared outside all year round. They lamb in the early spring and are fed mainly from rangeland pasture. In order to reduce supplements bought outside, the grass productivity of a limited area, i.e. 6 % of the rangeland was increased by means of fertilisers (65 kg N/ha/year + 120kg P(2)O(5)/ha every 3 years). Measured over 14 successive years, the average pasture yields were 1.0 t DM/ha on native rangeland and 4.4 t/ha on the fertilised one.
   A comparison of four ways of combined use of native and fertilised grass in the spring was performed with ewes suckling an average of 1.5 lambs/dam. Average lambs' growth were 268 to 295 g/day on fertilised paddocks rotationally grazed (2 grazing cycles on 4 paddocks) from mid April until May 20(th), with the stocking rate being 15-20 ewes/ha. Growth rates until weaning (end of June) were then kept around 250 g daily when the suckling ewes grazed native rangeland areas all preserved from previous grazing (6 paddocks, stocking rate 2-3 ewes/ha). Electric fences allowed rapid rotational grazing, the ewes staying no more than 4 days at the same place on fertilised grass and 8 days on native grass. From summer rise until January, the flock grazed mature grass as well as refusals from previous grazings. The grazing procedures ensured environmental care and control of invading vegetal species as a result of permanent rotational grazing and high instant stocking rates on mature vegetations. In this experiment, the rangeland resource was the only food offered to the ewes from mid-April until December-January and it represented 68 % of their total yearly energy intake. The remaining 32 % was made of hay from the farm (18 %) and concentrate (14 %) given at the end of pregnancy.
   The INRA 401 sheep showed productive and adaptative abilities. It can be considered a suitable breed for the sustainable valorisation for harsh and less favoured areas as well as a good tool to test different ways of pasture management.

AB Current evidence provides promising support for home-based mental health services for older adults whose access to traditional practice-based models of care is limited. Observational, uncontrolled studies report that mental health outreach services may be associated with greater access for mentally ill older people. Morerigorous studies report that home and community-based treatment is associated with a reduction in psychiatric symptoms. However, additional studies are needed using rigorous, standardized approaches to measure mental health outcomes and to characterize the intervention. Well-designed, controlled studies may help identify effective and sustainable approaches to providing evidence-based mental health treatment to frail or homebound older adults.

AB This paper describes a province-wide initiative aimed at building the capacity of community mental health programs to participate in program evaluation and development by transferring knowledge, promoting discussion and developing resources. Active involvement of stakeholders and evaluation of the current capacity of the field informed the ongoing development of the initiative. Recovery served as a guiding framework for formulating and understanding community mental health outcomes. Despite the interest of the field in evaluation activities, programs were constrained by limited resources and accountability structures. Sustainability of the project would be enhanced by direct work with programs to facilitate application of Continuous Improvement.

AB This article addresses the extent to which concepts of 'partnership' and 'ownership' of aid are understood differently by donors and local partners even in a country such as Bolivia where central government underwent a growing commitment to improved governance from the mid-1990s through poverty reduction, decentralisation and citizen participation. The introduction of two basket-funding initiatives is testimony to the growing confidence of the donor community in the emerging national ownership of the overall development process. Yet informational and motivational asymmetries, by creating perverse incentives, militate against the spread of basket funding, undermining the shift to national ownership and sustainability. Similarly, even though relations with the donor community were excellent, sector-level donor coordination is a surprisingly recent phenomenon. Government officials frequently reported the same kind of administrative burdens that are found in many other aid recipient countries. In addition, conditionalities of multilateral agencies embedded in structural adjustment and subsequent HIPC membership imposed a major burden on the government. They often caused delays in disbursements, especially where loans are disbursed in tranches subject to compliance with non-project specific conditions. Finally, the article draws attention to the contested meaning of 'national ownership' itself in a country with marked ethnic and social divisions, a factor that contributed to a marked decline in political stability and other governance indicators in 2003.

AB This paper presents the results of two studies carried out in order to design and test a self-report instrument to measure Self-Management Ability (the SMAS-30) in aging individuals. SMA refers to the core behavioral and cognitive abilities which presumably contribute to sustainable well-being in later life. Robust findings of the studies (n=275 and n=1338) showed that SMA could be measured reliably as a composite concept of abilities systematically linked to dimensions of well-being in adults aged 65 and over, with the different sub-scales revealing a profile of inter-related abilities. A sub-sample of participants in Study 2 (n=86) showed that the SMAS-30 had high reproducibility over a period of 16 weeks. The validity of the SMAS-30 was supported by meaningful associations with other constructs in both studies. As expected, the older and frailer the people, and the poorer their perceived health, the lower their SMA. Moreover, SMA was positively related to several dimensions of subjective well-being and the related concepts of general self-efficacy and mastery.

TI The transition in Dutch water management
SO REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE
LA English
DT Article
DE Water management; Transitions; Transition management; sustainability
AB Over the past decades, the Dutch people have been confronted with severe water-related problems, which are the result of an unsustainable water system, arising from human interventions in the physical infrastructure of the water system and the water management style. The claims of housing, industry, infrastructure and agriculture have resulted in increasing pressure on the water system. The continuous subsidence of soil and climate change has put pressure on the land. Hence, the nature and magnitude of water-related problems have changed. Longitudinal research of relevant national policy documents reveals that the water management regime has changed its water management style over the past 30 years from a technocratic scientific style towards an integral and participatory style. We have investigated if the historical development in Dutch Water management can be characterized as a transition. Based on longitudinal research through an integrated systems analysis, document research and expert interviews, we have reconstructed the historical narrative by using the transition concepts of multi-level and multi-phase. This research indicates that the shift in Dutch Water management can be characterized as a transition. This transition is currently in the take-off stage and near the acceleration stage. This is a crucial stage as long as the considerable gap between the strategic macro-vision and the practical implementation at the micro-level remains. As long as these levels are not compatible ( modulation), the transition will not be completed successfully. Transition management as multi-level governance model should therefore be adopted to facilitate the modulation.

TI Integrating "livelihoods" into integrated water resources management:
   taking the integration paradigm to its logical next step for developing
   countries
SO REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper examines the weaknesses in the current understanding of Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) from the perspective of livelihoods. Empowering poor people, reducing poverty, improving livelihoods, and promoting economic growth ought to be the basic objectives of IWRM. But as currently understood and used, IWRM often tends to focus on second-generation issues such as cost recovery, reallocation of water to "higher value" uses, and environmental conservation. This paper argues that IWRM needs to be placed in the broader context of both modern Integrated Natural Resource Management (INRM) and the livelihoods approach, which together take a holistic and people-centered approach. The paper concludes with an alternative definition of IWRM as involving the promotion of human welfare, especially the reduction of poverty, encouragement of better livelihoods and balanced economic growth through effective democratic development and management of water and other natural resources in an integrated multilevel framework that is as equitable, sustainable, and transparent as possible, and conserves vital ecosystems. Transparent user-friendly information and models for assisting decision making are essential features of livelihood-oriented IWRM.

LA English
DT Article
DE Environmental indicators; Ecosystem condition; Ecosystem goods and
   services; Remote sensing; Geographic information systems
AB Improvements in remote sensing technologies and the use of geographic information system (GIS), are increasingly allowing us to develop indicators that can be used to monitor and assess ecosystem condition and change at multiple scales. This paper presents global- and regional-level indicators developed by the World Resources Institute and collaborating partners using remote sensing and GIS. Presented as regional and global maps, these spatial indicators are ideal communication tools to raise awareness of the condition of the Earth's ecosystems among different audiences. Global and regional spatial indicators not only inform us about the current condition of, and pressures on, ecosystems, but also about the likely capacity of the ecosystem to continue to provide goods and services to future generations. The increasing focus on integrating socio-economic and biological information with remote sensing and GIS technology can only help to further our understanding and capacity to manage ecosystems in a more sustainable manner.

AB Spatial policies for regional sustainable development: a comparison of graphic and textual representations in regional plans in England and Germany, Regional Studies 39, 1167-1182. Cartographic representation in strategic spatial plans can be a powerful tool for the communication of spatial policies to achieve sustainable development. Regional plans in England and Germany were analysed to identify the extent to which sustainable development has been translated into policy principles and cartographic representations. The results demonstrate the problematic nature of visualizing the concept of sustainable development, and they show that there is wide variation between the two countries in the form and style of cartographic representation in regional planning in general.

AB Native orchid cultivation is a compatible alternative for impoverished coffee farmers in southeastern Mexico who are in crisis due to falling prices. Sustainable orchid cultivation is also an urgent necessity as an alternative to nonsustainable extraction from protected reserves, forest fragments and traditional coffee plantations, and to restore and conserve populations within these habitats. Our objective was to test the effects of locally available substrates and fertilizers upon orchids cultivated under typical rural conditions in coffee-producing areas in Soconusco, Chiapas. Seven species of epiphytic orchids native to Soconusco region-Cattleya aurantiaca, Brassavola nodosa, Prosthechea (Encyclia) chacaoensis, Anathallis (Pleurothallis) racemiflora, Cattleya skinneri, Cycnoches ventricosum and Encyclia cordigera-were propagated in vitro, acclimatized and established in rustic orchid galleries in the home gardens and plantations of coffee growers. Locally available waste products were used as substrates: clay tiles, tree bark, bamboo, seed hulls of pataxte (Theobroma bicolor) and wire baskets filled with bark chips. Two cheap and readily available commercial foliar feeds, Algaenzims (an organic product) and Bayfolan (a synthetic product) were tested. First, the substrates alone were tested for a period of 6 months to 1 year, then a combination of substrates and fertilizers were tested for 6 months, for effects upon leaf and root growth and root number. The mortality rates of these nonsymbiotically propagated, epiphytic orchids during the acclimatization phase, prior to these experiments, were high, between 60 and 90%. Once established in rustic galleries, the young orchid plants showed no preference for a particular substrate, survival depended upon technical problems during establishment, relating to difficulties with the attachment of plants to substrates, and the variable quality of care and attention offered by the farmers. Both fertilizers significantly improved one or all the parameters studied, and possibly counteracted the negative effects of the absence of symbiotic fungi, which, under natural conditions, are essential for orchid seed germination and adequate development of the young plant. More than half of the producers did not continue with the orchid cultures for economic and cultural reasons.

AB Current agricultural systems are the result of decoupling crop/livestock enterprises for short-term economic gain at the expense of long-term sustainability. Objectives of our research were to determine the influences of winter grazing dry gestating beef cows on no-till forage and grain production, water-use efficiency, and protein and phosphorus (P) production for an oat/pea-triticale/sweet clover-corn 3-year cropping system. Oat/pea and triticale crops were harvested for grain, with the straw and chaff left in swaths after harvest for winter grazing. Drilled corn for forage was swathed in late September. Cropping system treatments were: (1) straw and corn chopped and left in place (IP); (2) straw and corn baled and removed without livestock (R); and (3) straw and corn swath grazed by livestock (L). The first winter for grazing dry, bred cows was in 1999-2000; therefore, no treatment differences occurred for the 1999 crop. In 2000, oat/pea and triticale grain and straw production for the IP treatment was about half of the production for the R treatment, because of low oat/pea and triticale plant stands on the IP treatment. Averaged over all years, corn was about 1.5 times more efficient in using water for dry matter production when compared to oat/pea or triticale. Generally, protein and P production, on a unit area basis, were highest for corn and lowest for triticale. Averaged over 4 years, about half of the nitrogen used for protein production was derived from sources other than applied commercial fertilizer. Data suggest that more than 4 years of research are needed to understand cropping system and animal interactions on forage and grain production in integrated crop/livestock systems, with trends in year four suggesting that livestock may enhance forage and grain production.

AB Grain and livestock production have gradually been separated, as farmers have tended to specialize in one or the other. Some producers and scientists are beginning to question whether this is the best approach. An integrated crop/livestock project was initiated in 1999 to investigate potentially beneficial synergies to both enterprises. The cattle portion of this project involved wintering dry pregnant cows on swathed crop residue and drilled corn produced in a 3-year crop rotation, with all crops present each year. Swath grazing was initiated in mid-November of 1999, 2000 and 2001, and terminated in mid-February each year. Two replications of ten Hereford cows were rotationally grazed on swathed oat/pea and triticale crop residue and swathed drilled corn (RGSC). Comparison treatments were: cows grazing swathed western wheatgrass (SWWG) and cows fed hay in a drylot. Cows on the RGSC treatment were also fed a 20% crude protein supplement of oat/pea and triticale grain. Drilled corn was swathed in late September and western wheatgrass in early October. Three-year average winter-long weight gains for the RGSC cows were slightly lower (P < 0.10) than those for drylot cows. Body condition scores generally followed the same pattern as weight gain data. Reproductive and calf performance data were not significantly different among wintering treatments. Average daily feed costs per cow over the three winters were US$0.49, 0.65 and 0.73 for RGSC, SWWG and baled hay in a drylot, respectively, providing a potential daily savings of US$0.24 per cow with the RGSC treatment compared to bale feeding in a drylot. Swath grazing did not appear to have any adverse affects on mid-aged beef cow performance and could potentially reduce winter feeding costs and manure handling problems. The main problem with swath grazing is potentially deep snow and icing of the swaths.

AB A quasi-evolutionary model of socio-technical transitions is described in which regimes face selection pressures continuously. Differentiated transition contexts determine the form and direction of regime change in response to these pressures. The articulation of pressures, and the degree to which responses are coordinated and based on resources available within the regime, define the transition context. Four alternative contexts are described: endogenous renewal; re-orientation of trajectories; emergent transformation and purposive transitions. Agency and power in the governance of regime transformation are analysed. Power to affect change depends on regime membership, the distribution of resources for change and expectations.

TI Dilemmas in optimising the environmental benefit from recycling: A case
   study of glass container waste management in the UK
SO RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING

DT Article
DE household waste; cullet; recycling; aggregates
AB A fundamental challenge of sustainable development is to deliver massive improvements in resource efficiency, if projected economic growth rates are not to cause unacceptable levels of environmental degradation. An important element in the UK government's strategy to deliver on this compensation for growth agenda has been the policy commitments to increase levels of material recycling. Unfortunately, a number of technical, political and attitudinal obstacles stand in the way of achieving the targeted improvements in material recycling. For example, in the case of waste glass (or cullet) the imbalance between the colour mix in arisings of household and commercial glass container waste in the UK, and demand from UK glass container manufacturers, presents a significant barrier to closing the loop on this material flow. Efforts to resolve this imbalance have focused on alternative potential end uses for cullet and the resolution of related technical barriers, particularly in the use of cullet as secondary feedstock for aggregate and cement production.
   This paper presents an evaluation of the environmental outcomes of various options for the use of cullet with the aim of optimising the environmental benefits arising from the recycling activity. Taking energy use as a key environmental indicator, a study carried out for EMERGE Recycling in Manchester has shown that, whilst there are environmental gains to be made from substituting glass container feedstock for virgin raw material in the production of base aggregates, these gains are significantly less than those accruing from the substitution of cullet for virgin raw materials in the production of glass containers. Consequently, the paper argues that transporting household and commercial arisings of cullet for use in glass container manufacturing in EU countries, where cullet supply and demand does not suffer from the UK imbalance, provides a significantly more beneficial environmental outcome than its use as secondary feedstock for base aggregate and other building materials within the UK.

AB We present a simple dynamic model to get some key insights about the substitution of renewable for nonrenewable resources and the consequences for sustainability. We highlight the role of the elasticity of substitution (technological component) to determine the adjustment of production as a response to scarcity and growing ability of resources (environmental component). In some cases, the model predicts a smooth substitution of renewable for nonrenewable resources, but this process could work in the opposite direction if renewable resources are temporarily beyond their maximum sustainable yield, so that their marginal natural growth is negative. If substitution possibilities are high enough, it may be optimal to suspend the extraction of a resource to allow the biomass to regenerate. A production process is more likely to be sustainable the more heavily it depends on renewable, rather than nonrenewable resources. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Native plant establishment is limited by harsh environmental conditions in areas affected by tephra deposition following volcanic eruptions. Late-successional species might be lacking even decades after the disturbance. We assessed the effectiveness of pine-bark mulch, a by-product of sustainable timber production in the study area, in promoting the establishment and survival of a late-successional species (Pinus pseudostrobus) and a nitrogen-fixing legume (Lupinus elegans). We established a factorial experiment in areas covered with tephra during the eruption of the Paricutin volcano in the state of Michoacan, Mexico. After 1 year, P. pseudostrobus survival was significantly higher (p < 0.001) in plots with pine-bark mulching (46.5%) than in plots without mulching (21.8%). After 2 years, surviving pines with mulching were significantly taller (p= 0.03) than pines without mulching (45.3 +/- 3.8 cm and 31.2 +/- 3.7 cm, respectively). Lupinus elegans plants survived longer when grown in plots with pine-bark mulching than without mulching. Mulching reduced tephra temperatures during the dry season (when temperatures can reach up to 58 degrees C 4 cm below the surface of bare tephra). Lupinus elegans plants were affected by herbivory by small rodents, run-off, and frost at the end of the growing season. Our results suggest that mulching can ameliorate harsh environmental conditions on sites covered with tephra while incorporating a by-product of sustainable forestry into restoration practice.

AB The Isostichopus fuscus fishery in Mexico was heavily exploited until 1994, when it was closed due to overfishing. However, no information existed on the status of the populations. The fishery was evaluated through an age structured simulation model, and according to our analysis of the stock, the fishery can be feasible and sustainable as long as fishing mortality and age of first catch are optimized. In order to evaluate exploitation strategies, several scenarios were simulated considering different combinations of fishing intensities and ages of first catch. Input data for the model included population parameters, commercial catch and costs and benefits of the fishing operations. Yield production was strongly influenced by the fishing pressure and by the age of first capture. When the first one increased, significant decreases in yield and profits occurred. The best exploitation strategy was these parameters: fishing mortality level F = 0.15, age at first capture t(c) = 4 years, and yielding of similar to 430 tons. However, since the species reproduces for the first time at 5 years, extracting younger specimens would collapse the population. The critical value of fishing mortality was detected at F-c = 0.25. If exceeded, the population tends to exhaustion and the fishery is no longer profitable. In conclusion, L fuscus fishery is highly vulnerable to overfishing and age of catch. It must be taken into account that the management policies should be considered as pilot and used on a regional basis. Continuous monitoring of the stock, control of the number of fishing licenses and extracting only specimens 5 yeasr-old and older (around 20 cm and > 400 g), will allow the populations to recover from fishing activities.

AB In the Rhone plain in the Valais, Switzerland, a dynamic and productive area has been developed over the years in the context of the engineering works to control the river's course. This taming of nature has provided a basis for constructing all identity for the area's fruit and vegetable growers, all endeavour in title With a local vision of mail seeking to control and leave his mark oil the landscape. Consequently, these farmers are attached to their role as producers and to the technical skills chat have been developed since the production of special crops began in the area one hundred years ago. Their relations with nature have oscillated between respect and desire to preserve a work tool that their ancestors strove to construct and a need to control the advance of a hostile and unruly natural environment. Today, the multiple activities chat have recently developed in this restricted area are in conflict over flow the land should be used. However, one of the main measures of the third Rhone correction project will be to widen the river's Course. The proposed works are thus the opportunity for a general reflection oil the future use of the area. The new functions attributed to agriculture do not correspond at all to the vision that most farmers have of their job. But finding compromises and working oil the synergies between agriculcure and Other activities represents a major challenge, given that each activity depends so much on the others to ensure its long-term existence and at the same time the dynamism and health of the region.

DE community-based animal health worker; disease surveillance;
   sustainability; Tanzania
AB An 18 month trial was conducted in three districts of Arusha region, northern Tanzania, to assess the use of community-based animal health workers (CAHWs) in an official disease surveillance system. Disease reports provided by CAHWs were assessed using six indicators for effective disease surveillance, i.e. sensitivity, specificity, timeliness, representativeness, simplicity and acceptability. To assess sustainability issues and determine the incentives required by CAHWs to report disease, three different incentive models were tested in the trial. None of the incentive models involved direct payments to CAHWs. Before involving CAHWs in disease surveillance in the three trial districts, disease case reports as a proportion of cattle population were 0.13%, 0.20% and 0.12%. During the trial, disease case reports as a proportion of cattle population increased to 5.0%, 5.6% and 6.3%. The CAHWs also improved the spatial and temporal coverage of the disease surveillance system and provided timely reports. During the trial, national-level disease reporting in Tanzania increased by 17% owing to the sensitisation and support activities of the Pan African Programme for the Control of Epizootics in Tanzania. In Arusha region, disease reporting increased by 118%, and 49% of this improvement was attributable to increased reporting in the three trial districts. Reporting from these districts far exceeded that from any other district in Tanzania. Veterinarians confirmed the CAHWs' clinical diagnosis in 88% of the 170 clinical cases examined.
   The increase in disease reporting resulting from CAHW activities was sufficient to enable the national epidemiology unitto achieve its target in relation to World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) guidelines. The authors conclude that the use of CAHWs should be promoted in the national strategy for disease reporting. Additionally, CAHWs must be brought under the control of the Tanzanian veterinary authorities, a process that will include appropriate legislative reform.

AB Human population health has always been central in the justification for sustainable development but nearly invisible in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change negotiations. Current scientific evidence indicates that climate change will contribute to the global burden of disease through increases in diarrhoeal disease; vector-borne disease, and malnutrition, and the health impacts of extreme weather and climate events. A few studies have estimated future potential health impacts of climate change but often generate little policy-relevant information. Robust estimates of future health impacts rely on robust projections of future disease patterns. The application of a standardized and established methodology has been developed to quantify the impact of climate change in relation to different greenhouse gas emission scenarios. All health risk assessments are necessarily biased toward conservative best-estimates of health effects that are easily measured. Global, regional, and national risk assessments can take no account of irreversibility, or plausible low-probability events with potentially very high burdens on human health. There is no "safe limit" of climate change with respect to health impacts as health systems in some regions do not adequately cope with the current climate variability. Current scientific methods cannot identify global threshold health effects in order for policymakers to regulate a "tolerable" amount of climate change. We argue for the need for more research to reduce the potential impacts of climate change on human health, including the development of improved methods for quantitative risk assessment. The large uncertainty about the future effects of climate change on human population health should be a reason to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and not a reason for inaction.

AB This article explores the role of broadcast news media decisionmakers in shaping public understanding and debate of climate change risks. It locates the media within a "tangled web" of communication and debate between sources, media, and publics. The article draws on new qualitative research in the British context. The main body of it focuses on media source strategies, on climate change storytelling in news, and the "myth of detachment" sustained by many news decisionmakers. The empirical evidence, gathered between 1997 and 2004, is derived primarily from recordings and notes drawn from a series of seminars that has brought together equal numbers of BBC news and television decisionmakers and environment/development specialists. The seminars have created a rare space for extended dialogue between media and specialist perspectives on the communication of complex climate change science and policy. While the article acknowledges the distinctive nature of the BBC as a public sector broadcaster, the evidence confirms and extends current understanding of the career of climate change within the media more broadly. The working group discussions have explored issues arising out of how stories are sourced and, in the context of competitive and time-pressured newsrooms, shaped and presented in short news pieces. Particularly significant is the disjuncture between ways of talking about uncertainty within science and policy discourse and media constructions of objectivity, truth, and balance. The article concludes with a summary of developments in media culture, technology, and practice that are creating opportunities for enhanced public understanding and debate of climate change risks. It also indicates the need for science and policy communities to be more active critics and sources of news.

AB As policy makers and funders have become more concerned with allocating scarce resources effectively, attention to the sustainability of health intervention programs has increased. However, the empirical knowledge base about factors facilitating or working against sustainability remains at an early stage. The aim of this study was to contribute to improved understanding of the conditions under which community-based injury prevention programs are most likely to attain sustainability. Ten Swedish community-based injury prevention programs were analysed with respect to factors that contribute to or detract from program sustainability. All the programs are integrated within existing municipality structures. Data were collected by means of semi-structured telephone interviews with key informants.
   The results suggested that different factors are interrelated, with no one factor being either primary or by itself sufficient for program sustainability. Financial, human, and relational resources lay the groundwork for the long-term operation of a program. The "integrated" program model appears to facilitate sustainability, but program intensity is vulnerable to changes in the financial status of the municipality and the priority-setting by municipality political decision makers. Sustainability may be compromised if a program becomes too dependent on a few key individuals. In contrast to financial, human, and relational resources, structural resources (e.g., injury surveillance and goals) appeared to have limited influence on sustainability. The programs were sustained with little evidence of effectiveness, resulting in limited feedback about how to improve a program in order to achieve and maintain long-term effectiveness.

AB Commercial forests in many parts of the world are deficient in nitrogen and phosphorus. These nutrient-deficient forests often exist in close proximity to large animal feeding operations, meat processing and other food, textile, or other biomass-processing plants, and municipal waste treatment facilities. Many of these facilities produce large surpluses of nitrogen, phosphorus, and organic matter as gaseous ammonia, urea, uric acid, phosphorus compounds, bacterial sludges, and partially treated municipal wastewaters. These co-existing and substantial nutrient deficiencies and surpluses offer ready-made opportunities for discovery, demonstration, and commercial development of science-based, technology-facilitated, environmentally sound, economically viable, and socially acceptable "win-win alliances" among these major industries based on the principles of industrial ecology and sustainable development. The major challenge is to discover practical means to capture the surplus nutrients and put them to work in forest stands from which value-added products can be produced and sold at a profit.

AB The nitrogen (N) cycle is essentially 'leaky'. The losses of small amounts of nitrate to waters and of ammonia and nitrous oxide to the atmosphere are a part of the global biogeochemical N cycle. However, intensive agricultural production, industry and vehicle use have more than doubled the amount of 'reactive' N in the environment, resulting in eutrophication, ecosystem change and health concerns. Research has identified agricultural practices that cause large losses of N and, in some cases, developed solutions. This paper discusses the problems of maintaining productivity while reducing N losses, compares conventional with low input (integrated) and organic farming systems, and discusses wider options. It also looks at the need to integrate studies on N with other environmental impacts, set in the context of the whole farm system, to provide truly sustainable agricultural systems.

AB Biodiversity is thought to be essential for ecosystem stability, function and long-term sustainability. Since nitrogen is the limiting nutrient for plant growth in many terrestrial ecosystems, reactive nitrogen has the potential to reduce the diversity of terrestrial vegetation and associated biota through favouring species adapted to quickly exploiting available nutrients. Although the potential has long been recognised, only recently has enough evidence come together to show beyond reasonable doubt that these changes are already occurring. Linked together, experimental, regional/empirical, and time-series research provide a powerful argument that enhanced deposition of reactive nitrogen across Great Britain, and potentially the rest of Europe, has resulted in a significant and ongoing decline in grassland species richness and diversity.

AB Soil nitrogen balance assessment (SNBA) serves as an effective tool for estimating the magnitude of nitrogen loss/gain of the agro-eco systems and to appraise their sustainability. SNBA brings forth awareness of soil fertility problems, besides providing information relating to the resultant release of nitrogen into the environment consequent to agricultural practices. Quantitative information relating to nitrogen escape into the environment through such exercises can be gainfully utilized for identification of causative factors, enhancing fertilizer use efficiency and formulating programmes aimed at plugging N leakages. An overview of nitrogen balance approaches and methodologies is presented. A deeper understanding and insight into the agro-eco systems provided by the SNBA exercises can lay the basis for the formulation of effective agronomic interventions and policies aimed at promoting sustainable agriculture and a benign environment.

DE holistic control of reactive N; regional; national and global scales
ID NITROUS-OXIDE EMISSIONS; METHANE FLUXES
AB Reactive N is closely related to the global issues of climate change and regional pollutions. Nitrous oxide (N2O), the fourth important gas among greenhouse gases, is produced as an intermediate in nitrification and denitrification processes. As methane (CH4) is the end product in the anoxic decomposition of organic materials, mitigation options of N2O emission are different from those of CH4 emission. Nitrate is another reactive N bringing about the eutrification of aqueous environments and the hazard of drinking water. Mitigation of NO3 problem also relates closely to the N2O emission. Therefore, holistic approaches are necessary for solving the problems of Earth warming and environmental eutrification by reactive N at the same time. In this paper, the deforestation in the tropics, and the present situations of food supply and sustainable agriculture in Japan are re-evaluated in terms of N2O emission and NO3 discharge from the agricultural sector. The magnitude of N2O emission by deforestation in the tropics may fall within the similar order of magnitude by N fertilization. As more N is imported as foods and fodder than the amount of fertilized N in Japan, more attention should be paid to the phases of their consumption and waste treatment. Sole attention to the production stage is not enough for the total mitigation of various environmental problems by reactive N in relation to agriculture. Parameters holistically evaluating the impact of reactive N on the Earth and respective regions are urgently necessary.

AB With the huge intensification of agriculture and the increasing awareness to human health and natural resources sustainability, there was a shift towards the development of environmental friendly N application approaches that support sustainable use of land and sustain food production.
   The effectiveness of such approaches depends on their ability to synchronize plant nitrogen demand with its supply and the ability to apply favored compositions and dosages of N-species. They are also influenced by farming scale and its sophistication, and include the following key concepts: (i) Improved application modes such as split or localized ("depot") application; (ii) use of bio-amendments like nitrification and urease inhibitors and combinations of (i) and (ii); (iii) use of controlled and slow release fertilizers; (iv) Fertigation-fertilization via irrigation systems including fully automated and controlled systems; and (v) precision fertilization in large scale farming systems. The paper describes the approaches and their action mechanisms and examines their agronomic and environmental significance. The relevance of the approaches for different farming scales, levels of agronomic intensification and agro-technical sophistication is examined as well.

AB This paper brings the debate on sustainable transport policy into direct confrontation with the embodied Practice of cycling in a highly urbanized environment. Using the example of a regular journey to work the author undertook in Birmingham, UK during the summer of 2003, Lees' notion of a more performative approach to understanding architecture is extended to a performance of the wider city. Tracing in detail the practice of this journey, the paper uses the notion of affect to highlight the sheer physicality of the bike ride and bow the city is thus remade through the cyclist's experiences. This Performative understanding is contrasted with more traditional understandings of the city, illustrating bow the two reinforce each other. Ultimately the question is posed of whether the thrills and chills of urban cycling in the UK will leave it as a marginalized transport mode for the foreseeable future, despite noises from policy makers about using cycling to solve problems of urban congestion and sustainability.

DE rubber; Hevea; smallholdings; Malaysia; Orang Asli
AB This study assesses an array of physiochemical soil properties from a sample of rubber smallholdings managed by a group of Orang Ash (original people) in northwest Pahang, Peninsular Malaysia. Malaysian smallholders in general face significantly lower productivity levels than the large rubber estates and plantations (Malaysian Rubber Board, 2002). Among smallholders, Orang Asli households generate the lowest rubber yields, earn the lowest non-rubber income, and are most threatened by land scarcity (RISDA, 2003). Furthermore, little is known about the soils of these smallholdings since most rubber-related soil surveys focus on estates and experiment stations (Pushparajah & Amin, 1977). An understanding of the morphological and physiochemical soil properties of Orang Ash rubber fields is a crucial step toward the efficient allocation of government resources that aim to enhance productivity, promote sustainable agriculture, and improve household welfare. The objectives of this project were to (1) determine the predominant physiochemical characteristics of these soils, (2) evaluate them with an established rubber suitability classification system, (3) group soils according to region, geomorphic position, and estimated soil series in order to make generalizations about soil limitations for certain soil types, and (4) offer methods by which to mitigate the effects of these limitations. We find that there is a great deal of heterogeneity within our sample with regard to both soil type and limitation. The most common physical limitations were related to flooding, uprooting, soil texture, and slope. Almost all soils were severely depleted in organic nutrients and base cations. Overall, these limitations were correctable via drainage, terracing, or establishment of a cover crop. It is recommended that any application of chemical fertilizer take soil type into account.

TI Assessing risks to groundwater from contaminated soils
SO SOIL USE AND MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE risk assessment; groundwater; contaminated soils
AB The regulatory regime for contaminated soils and groundwater in the UK is risk based. Indeed, the definition of contaminated land in UK law requires the presence, or likelihood, of significant pollution or harm before affected land meets the statutory test of being contaminated land. In dealing with contamination, a risk management approach is used that also requires the consideration of wider land-use planning priorities, the costs and benefits of remedial action, and the goal of achieving sustainable development. A parallel risk-based framework is adopted for polluted groundwater. The risk assessment process adopted for contaminated groundwater in the UK follows a tiered structure. A simple conceptual model is developed from desk study and site reconnaissance. This model is then used as the basis for designing a site investigation programme, the sampling being undertaken to test assumptions within the model as well as to develop it further. The Environment Agency (England & Wales) has developed a package of tools to aid this tiered approach. This paper describes the integrated risk assessment and risk management processes for contaminated groundwater in the UK, with emphasis on the tools and methods developed. It explains the importance of a conceptual understanding (or model) to all tiers of risk assessment and subsequent risk management.

TI Characterisation of the forming behaviour of patchwork blanks

DT Article
DE forming behaviour; patchwork blanks; Martens hardness; tensile tests;
   finite element analysis; experimental validation
AB In order to satisfy the increasing demand for environmental sustainability and passengers' safety, automotive manufacturers are more and more obliged to develop improved body concepts for lighter but also safer vehicles. At the same time, production costs have to be minimised in order to cope with the international market. Besides the application of new materials and innovative production processes mainly the use of tailor-made semi-finished products such as tailored welded blanks, tailored rolled blanks or tailored tubes can contribute substantially to this objective. Furthermore, for the production of sheet metal components with a load adapted material distribution, the patchwork blank technique represents a potential alternative to the widely-used concept of tailored blanks. But even if patchwork blanks offer some additional advantages, this innovative technique has hardly found its way into series production due to a number of unsolved challenges regarding their formability and numerical modelling of corresponding forming processes.
   In this contribution the forming behaviour of welded patchwork blanks is investigated by means of experimental trials and finite element analyses. In order to simulate the forming processes of patchwork blanks accurately, knowledge about the characteristics of the weld metal, including the weld bead and the heat affected zone, is essential. For this purpose, Martens hardness measurements, which allow the analysis of the weld seam and the determination of the lateral extension of the heat affected zone, have been carried out. Subsequently, uniaxial tensile tests with longitudinally welded samples have been applied to characterise the constitutive behaviour of the weld metal. The results obtained from these experimental investigations have been implemented to different finite element models for patchwork blank forming processes. A comparison of the numerical results with experimental data obtained from a series of Nakajima tests allows a validation of the presented modelling techniques. It can be stated that the accuracy of the finite element analysis may be improved if the modified material properties along the weld seam are considered in the numerical model.

TI Tending the infrastructure commons: ensuring the sustainability of our
   vital public systems
SO STRUCTURE AND INFRASTRUCTURE ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
DE sustainable infrastructure; supply chains; infrastructure commons
AB It is by now well recognized that civil infrastructure systems are essential in providing the range of services generally considered necessary to support a nation's economic wellbeing and quality of life. Consequently, it is of the utmost importance to government, business, and the general populace that these services are sustained over the long term by periodic replenishment of the physical systems that deliver them. This has proven challenging for several reasons. First, civil infrastructures do not all lie within the public domain. Second, infrastructures are complex systems that are vulnerable to failures or service degradations in other systems because of their interconnected and interdependent natures. Third, despite the obvious importance of reliable and resilient systems to our collective social, economic, and political well-being, it has been difficult to fund the necessary maintenance and capital improvements. Deciding what levels of reliability should be provided and who should pay for it are not simple questions to be addressed solely by service providers, customers, or government regulators. This paper will present the concept of an infrastructure commons and recommend some initial actions that the federal government could take to ensure that the national 'public good' aspect of civil is preserved and enhanced. These actions include the beginning of an informed and serious dialogue between the public and private sectors, building coalitions for action among stakeholders in the governance process, and exploring alternative mechanisms for ensuring dependable and sustainable resource streams.

TI Improvement of feeding independence in end-stage cancer patients under

SO SUPPORTIVE CARE IN CANCER
LA English
DT Article
DE feeding; cancer; palliative care; occupational therapy
AB Purpose: Feeding independence is important to improve the quality of life (QOL) of patients receiving palliative care. Studies on feeding independence among cancer patients under palliative care are unavailable. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of occupational therapy in promoting feeding independence in end-stage cancer patients in palliative care. Patients and methods: Thirty-six end-stage cancer inpatients with feeding difficulties attributable to improper positioning (58.3%), one-handedness (22.2%), and upper limb impairment (11.1%) were enrolled from two hospitals in Hong Kong. The feeding independence level (level 1 >= 25% assistance; level 2 < 25% assistance) of patients was assessed weekly for 3 weeks. Major treatment modalities included positioning (58%), feeding aid support (25%), and upper limb support (11%). Multilevel models were used for comparing feeding independence levels at baseline and weekly intervals. Results: There was a significant improvement in feeding independence from baseline to week 1 (P < 0.0001). Multilevel models showed that there were no significant differences in the level of feeding independence between weeks 1 and 2 (P=0.246) and between weeks 1 and 3 (P=0.165) among the subjects after controlling for age and sex, indicating that the improved feeding independence in week 1 was sustainable through weeks 2 and 3. Conclusion: The prospective study showed for the first time that the provision of appropriate feeding supports could markedly enhance feeding independence in end-stage cancer patients receiving palliative care, which might improve activities of daily living and QOL, and minimize excessive disability. Furthermore, it merits cooperation among occupational therapists, caregivers, and ward staff to promote feeding independence in this group of patients.

AB Agenda 21 (UNCED, 1992) highlighted the role unions and workers might play in fostering the principles of sustainable development. It targeted the movement's traditional focus on human rights, equity, democracy and fair, decent and sustainable employment. The international union discourse on sustainable development that preceded the WSSID (2002) indicated that unions see themselves as part of a social movement towards deliberative democracy focused on sustainable development.
   The paper draws upon an evolving research relationship between academics and the union movement in New Zealand. The inquiry examines conceptions of sustainable development held by union members; how the concept relates to the workplace in New Zealand; what function it may play in 'union renewal' and the potential role of unions in promoting sustainable development in the workplace and broader community. In this initial paper, an account is provided of conceptions of sustainable development held by senior union officials in New Zealand. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

DE welfare economics; sustainability; social choice; Thailand
AB This paper presents a new measure of sustainability within a welfare economics framework. Gross domestic product (GDP) can be used as an indicator of sustainability if the GDP estimates are undertaken within a cost-benefit analysis framework based on social choice perspectives. Sustainability is dependent on a healthy and functioning socio-economic and environmental (SEE) system. Economic development can damage the SEE system through resource degradation, over-harvesting and pollution. This paper addresses the tensions between economic development and sustainability by undertaking a number of SEE-based adjustments to GDP based on social choice perspectives in order to measure sustainability. These adjustments include the environmental and social costs caused by economic development such as water pollution, the depletion of non-renewable resources, and deforestation. Thailand is used as a case study for a 25 year period (1975-1999). The results show a divergence in terms of GDP per capita and the SEE-adjusted GDP per capita figure. The paper concludes that, with increasing environmental and social costs of economic development, pursuing such extreme high growth objectives without due environmental and social considerations can threaten present social welfare and future sustainability.

AB This paper explores the ways that local people in different parts of the globe are working at the local level toward sustainable development, whether knowingly or unknowingly. Community forest management at the local level in Nepal is a successful model of sustainability. It exemplifies the ideals of strong sustainability, which enhances natural, economic and social capitals concurrently. The objective of such groups is to try to avoid 'the tragedy of the commons', and to conserve forests and obtain forest products by sustainably managing local forests. In addition, people realize indirect benefits of forest protection such as further control of landslides, and improvement of local watershed and microclimate. Further, users' groups are not only taking the forest products, but also increasing the forest stock, which is an act of natural capital enhancement. In addition, local communities are not only satisfying their demand for natural resources, but are also determined to increase their socioecological resource potential for the future.

AB The condition of modern, Western society is examined in two parts. In Part 1 the root causes of our society's unsustainable condition are considered through a new approach, becoming ecosynchronous, to discuss the unfolding of self (becoming) and being aware of events that are meaningfully related (synchronicity). The problems that confront us are first noted, including where those trends are heading, followed by a review of initiatives underway to address these problems. The limitations of a shallow ecology approach are discussed and juxtaposed with philosophical and psychological root causes of systemic failure. This includes reviews of the long-term cycles of civilizations, the decline of a sacred relationship with nature, the Western view of reality, ecopsychology, ecofeminism, sense of place and consumerism/busyness. A shift to an ecocentric position is advocated, as is an emphasis on personal development, with direction offered toward becoming more sustainable (discussed further in Part 2).

AB Many scholars have advocated that the cornerstone of sound environmental management is an effective control of stability of the human life-support system. A common theme running through these suggestions is that we should maximize the inherent stability of the life-support system. This essay proposes a new scheme or technique of classifying the stability of systems. Then the essay describes how the stabilizing mechanisms may be considered as a force that holds the human lifesupport system intact. Stabilizing energy is the energy available to do work, without compromising the integrity of the configuration. The anthropogenic processes of harvesting or using the system as a sink for pollutants are the counterforce that tends to destabilize the system. The basic conclusion is that if society is using a system, then the maximum energy of the anthropogenic processes cannot exceed the stabilizing energy. If this occurs, the system reaches its metastate. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

ID PUBLIC DEBT
AB Using a small theoretical model it is first shown that it is reasonable to limit public deficit and debt in relation to GDP in the long-run. Then we describe fiscal institutions called 'debt brakes' which are designed to prevent public deficit and debt from going off course. We present some models which have been applied in some Swiss cantons, especially in the canton of St. Gallen, and the respective institution recently introduced at the federal level. Altogether, the models in the different cantons are quite successful. At the federal level we still have to wait before we can evaluate the results. Finally, we describe how the problem of a possible bail out of cantons and local communities is solved in Switzerland. Taking all results together, we come to the conclusion that by choosing appropriate institutions federal countries are rather more able to perform a sustainable fiscal policy than unitary states. In this process, budgetary restrictions and/or fiscal referenda play prominent roles at all levels. On the other hand, a special stability pact between the different governmental levels does not seem to be necessary.

AB Driven by growing international demand for shrimp and stagnating catches of wild shrimp, the shrimp aquaculture industry has grown remarkably over the past two decades. Initial hopes that farmed shrimp could provide an environmentally benign alternative to over-exploited wild stocks have, however, proven disappointing. Although global growth has been steady, the industry has experienced dramatic production crashes at national and sub-national scales associated with severe environmental damage. From a systems perspective, the industry is prone to exceed and consume its environmental carrying capacity, resulting in boom and bust patterns of development. In this paper we describe a dynamic commodity system model built to examine boom and bust in the shrimp aquaculture industry. Experiments with the model suggest that a policy that taxes the industry and rebates proceeds to licensed producers may help shift the system toward sustainability.

AB This article investigates transitions at the level of societal functions ( e. g. transport, communication, housing). Societal functions are fulfilled by socio-technical systems, which consist of a cluster of aligned elements, e. g. artefacts, knowledge, user practices and markets, regulation, cultural meaning, infrastructure, maintenance networks and supply networks. To understand how transitions from one socio-technical system to another come about, the article describes a conceptual multi-level perspective. The perspective is illustrated with a historical case study: the transition from horse-drawn carriages to automobiles in the USA ( 1860 - 1930). The case study shows that technological substitution approaches to this transition are too simple, because they neglect the electric tram and bicycle, which acted as important stepping stones. The case study also corrects another mistake, namely that the gasoline car won by chance from steam and electric automobiles. It will be shown that particular niches played a crucial role in this competition, as well as the wider socio-technical context. The case study deviates on three points from the multi-level perspective. These deviations are used to conceptualize a particular transition pathway, called `de-alignment and re-alignment'.

AB The effect of today's turbulent environment means that organisations need to improve their competitive advantage and swiftly respond to changing technology and markets. An organisation's ability to continuously innovate its products and business systems is essential to its future success. However, this ability to stimulate innovation is highly dependent upon the stock of potential ideas and problem solutions, which is available to feed the innovation process. These 'seedlings of innovation' are the product of the creative processes of an organisation. Whilst continuous, sustainable innovation is an essential competitive capability for future organisational success, to date the creative process has been allowed to operate in an 'ad hoc' and serendipitous fashion. Continuous innovation means that organisations need to be able to effectively manage their creative processes to ensure their innovation process has a plentiful supply of good ideas and solutions. To this end, a framework for enhancing networked creativity is presented as a means towards the effective management of the creative process within organisations. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB For many years, researchers have tried to shed light into the black box of economic agents to investigate the mechanisms that guide their actions. Evolutionary economists have used the concept of 'routines' to explain why some firms are more innovative than others. The case study on French and Moroccan oil refineries presented in this paper suggests that this concept can also be used to explore differences in the way these firms manage health, safety, and environmental (HSE) issues. An improved understanding of firms' HSE behaviour allows policy-makers to design policies that can foster the emergence of strong HSE routines and substantially improve firms' HSE performance. Results show that, in spite of low HSE regulatory pressures in Morocco, Samir oil refineries operating in the Kingdom have developed an HSE management routine. A tabled presentation of the HSE management routine of Samir and of the French group Total allows us to compare the HSE behaviour of these firms, and to suggest how new routines could trigger a lock-out from the low HSE performance of Samir.

AB Stainless steels are corrosion resistant alloys which are widely used in consumer goods and industrial equipments. Stainless steels contain scarce and energy intensive elements such as Ni, Cr, Mo, etc. So, closed loop recycling is preferable for sustainable production of stainless steel. However, some parts of stainless steel are not separate from ordinal steel scraps in recycling processes and not recycled as "stainless steel". The objective of this study is to analyze the dynamic material flow of stainless steels in Japan and assess CO2 emissions reduction potentials by promotion of closed loop recycling of stainless steels in the future. First, the authors analyzed material balance of input elements, i.e. Fe, Ni and Cr, in the production of stainless steels in 2002 to figure out the material flow of stainless steel which can not be obtained from statistics. The amount of post-consumer stainless steel that would come into society in the future was estimated by PBM (Population Balance Model). It was found that only 2% of post-consumer stainless steel of Fc-Cr alloys was collected as stainless steel scraps and the rest was collected as ordinal steel scrap. On the other hand, approximately 95% of post-consumer stainless steel of Fe-Ni-Cr alloys was collected as stainless steel scraps. CO2 emissions reduction potential by the increase of 1% in closed loop recycling of stainless steel scraps of Fe-Cr alloys was estimated at 75000 t/year by using LCA.

AB Tolerance to low nitrogen conditions is a highly desired characteristic for sustainable crop production. In this study, we analyzed the genetic components associated with low N tolerance in rice at seedling stage, including main effects, epistatic effects of the quantitative trait locus (QTLs), and QTL by environment interactions (QEs), using a population of 239 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) from a cross between Zhenshan 97 and Minghui 63, the parents of an elite hybrid. A genetic linkage map with 253 DNA maker loci was constructed. Seedlings of RILs were cultivated in low N and normal N solutions. Root, shoot and plant weight in the two N treatments were measured and the relative weight of the two treatments for each trait was considered as measurements for low N tolerance. Four to eight QTLs with main effects were detected for each of the nine traits. Very few QTLs were detected in both low and normal N conditions, and most QTLs for the relative measurements were different from those for traits under the two N treatments, indicating very little commonality in the genetic basis of the traits and their relative performance under low and normal N conditions. A total of 103 digenic interactions were detected for the nine traits. While the epistatic effects collectively accounted for large proportions of the variation for several traits, the effects of QEs appeared to be trivial. It was concluded that low N tolerance of rice seedling had complex genetic basis that requires extensive studies for full characterization.

TI Ecotourism and indigenous micro-enterprise formation in northern
   Australia opportunities and constraints
SO TOURISM MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID LESSONS
AB Indigenous Australians suffer considerable social and economic disadvantage. The challenge for Indigenous communities and policy makers is to discover or create opportunities that will provide sustainable development. Tourism is seen as one sector that could possibly provide such opportunities. Indigenous tourism enterprises are in most situations likely to be micro businesses. Micro businesses, Indigenous and non-Indigenous, have relatively high failure rates so it is important to undertake substantial planning to avoid failure. This paper presents the results of a planning process undertaken by an Indigenous clan planning to operate their own ecotourism micro-enterprise within Ngukurr, an Indigenous community in northern Australia. The study highlights the fact tourism does provide potential for economic development because Indigenous enterprises often have some competitive advantages. In addition, the study highlights the fact that communities often do not have the capacity to undertake all the tasks necessary to establish and operate a commercially successful ecotourism enterprise. Partnerships with other stakeholders within the region can help overcome this constraint. Finally, it is noted that the CDEP scheme has the potential to satisfy the need for funds that cannot be satisfied through normal channels. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI City centre regeneration through residential development: Contributing
   to sustainability
SO URBAN STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
ID URBAN REGENERATION; COMPACT CITY; GENTRIFICATION; LONDON; POLICY
AB Following a discussion of recent policies for the city centre in Britain, the paper explores the contribution of residential development to aspects of sustainability, drawing on a range of survey evidence in Bristol and Swansea. The residents are frequent shoppers, helping to sustain the local daytime economy. Sustainability goals are also supported because large proportions of residents walk to city centre attractions, and many also to their places of work, showing reduced reliance on the private car. Support for the expanding nighttime economy reflects the age, gender and social class composition of the resident population, with different attractions receiving different levels of support from different social groups, but with younger adults as the mainstay. Sustainability in the city centre context appears best served by a majority of young adult residents, ameliorated by a sizeable proportion of older adults, and an absence of households with children. Grandiose government sustainability aims of creating the truly balanced community which includes many children, should be modified in this local context.

TI Incineration - Is there a case?
SO WATER AND ENVIRONMENT JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
DE dewatered sludge; incineration; No-x; dioxins; pathogens
AB Incineration has suffered from a sustained campaign of misinformation. Consequently it has been regarded as the least sustainable option for the treatment of wastes, including sewage sludge, By looking carefully at the issues surrounding the incineration of sewage sludge, as an example, it can be seen that reality does not support the commonly held view Modem plants are an effective means of recovering the energy value of sludge and at the some time offer a continuous operation, which is independent of weather or land constraints.
   Of course incineration needs to be regulated and EU Directives and National Regulations set the emission standards. The technology is such that these standards can be met, and more than this, the systems are capable of upgrading as more stringent standards are imposed.
   Concerns over NOx dioxins, metals and pathogens are highlighted. In addition the permitting process is discussed. None of these should present a barrier to the implementation of incineration projects. Indeed the paper goes further and demonstrates that there is likely to be on increasing role for incineration as landfill, recycling to agricultural land and other options become more restrictive.

TI A brief historical analysis of water rights in South Africa
SO WATER INTERNATIONAL
LA English
DT Article
DE water rights; dominus fluminis; sustainability; efficiency; riparian
AB This article reviews the historical development path of water rights in South Africa during the last 300 years or so. The basic finding is that water rights have come full circle. As early as 1652, the Dutch Company rulers declared water as public commodity and dominus fluminis status of the state, and they imposed the Roman-Dutch law in the country. The British, in contrast, privatized water and linked it with land tenure, thus establishing the supremacy of the riparian principle, and the apartheid government tried to swing the balance again to the Roman-Dutch law. However the modern law under the democratic regime has appointed the central government as trustee of water resources with the major objective of promoting the efficient, sustainable, and beneficial use of water in the public interest and providing equitable access to water to all. However it has brought much more responsibility than that envisaged by the law-makers.

ID SUSTAINABLE WATER; MANAGEMENT
AB Water quality is an urgent problem in Harare main water supply source, Lake Chivero, while water scarcity will be a problem soon. This study focuses on sustainable ways of urban water and nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus) management in Harare, part of the Lake Chivero catchment. The Dublin Principles on water conservation, environmental protection, reuse, and economic utilization of water were used as a basis for formulating innovative and responsive solutions. External and internal drivers for future evolution of wastewater approaches are identified. Water conservation, treatment, and reuse strategies are developed including water-saving devices, regulation, leak detection and repair and including wastewater treatment and reuse. The three levels where wastewater can be handled onsite decentralized, and centralized-are discussed and solutions formulated. Based on this, a strategic framework, the so-called "3-Step Strategic Approach," is then developed aimed at the sustainable use of water nutrients, and other resources in the urban environment. This 3-Step Strategic Approach consists of pollution prevention and minimization (Step 1), reuse after treatment (Step 2), and discharge into the environment with stimulation of self-purfication capacity of the receiving environment (Step 3). The 3-Step Strategic Approach was subsequently applied to the Lake Chivero catchment, which demonstrated that these strategies could substantially reduce current water pollution and future water scarcity problems in Harare.

AB Groundwater plays a critical role in and West China where water is the limiting factor for development. This paper first describes groundwater characteristics in a region of four and inland river watersheds and the problems associated with groundwater consumption. This region exhibits a unique alternating pattern of high mountains and depressions, which results in extensive interactions of surface water and groundwater Then the authors propose six strategies to support adequate exploitation and use of groundwater in the region. These strategies are: 1) setting up a groundwater monitoring system; 2) forming a unified watershed authority; 3) protecting mountain ecology; 4) increasing the efficiency of groundwater usage; 5) protecting groundwater; and 6) supporting advanced research. The implementation of these strategies should be built upon the promotion of sustainable economic development and broad public support.

DE community care for elders; social services for minority ethnic elders;

AB In Germany, the topic 'Ethnicity and Age' is a central concomitant of demographic and social change and has become a big challenge for existing structures of community care for elders. In this context, the Kreis Unna implemented a model project, which aimed at informing minority ethnic elders about the German care and welfare system. The project also tried to promote their usage of services and offers for elders in a sustainable way. Within the frame of the project, two information series were held. The first addressed minority ethnic elders and informed them about the German care and welfare system. The second qualified staff in the field of care and work for elders for the special needs of minority ethnic elders. The project was supported and evaluated by the Institute for Gerontology at the University of Dortmund.
   By viewing the results of the evaluation, it becomes evident that the two information and qualification series proved successful for both groups and, in general, are transferable to other municipalities. However, it also became clear that reducing barriers of access to the German care and welfare system is a very difficult for both sides. A better usage of institutions and services of community care for elders by minority ethnic elders can only be accomplished by constant measures.

AB This survey highlights some recent advances on modeling the economic state of some nations of the world which are linked up in solidarity and competition or which are isolated. The problem of controllability, convergence, and permanence are explored. Some practical recent policy implications are deduced.
   Earth revolves around the sun in approximately circular orbit with radius r = a, completing a revolution in the time T = 2 pi(a(3)/GM)(1/2) which is one earth year; here M is the mass of the sun and G is the universal gravitational constant. The gravitational force of the sun on the earth is given by GM(m/r2) where m is the mass of the earth. Therefore, if the earth "stood still" losing its orbital velocity, it will fall straight on a line into the sun in accordance with Newton's second law.
   Md(2)r/dt(2) = -GM(M)/r(2)
   If this calamity occurred what fraction of the normal year T will it take for the earth to splash into the sun?" (Nagle, Saff, Snider)
   "Why did the earth stand still?" (Ndu Udo)
   "The symbol of Love and the earth's lover is the moon. With joy it dances around the earth in a circular orbit. When the inhabitants of the earth prefer hate and revenge to love, the moon stops to love, and stands still, losing its orbital velocity. It falls straight on a line into the earth in accordance with Newton's second law. The crash makes the earth stand still precipitating the Armageddon." (Wisdom Goodness) (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The surface of LiNi0.8Co0.2O2 cathode particles was coated with various wt.% of La2O3 through a polymeric process, followed by calcination at 973 K for 5 h in air. The coated layer prevents the surface of the cathode materials from direct contact with the electrolyte and has demonstrated sustainable extended cycle stability. XRD patterns of the coated materials indicated no effect on the crystal structure (alpha-NaFeO2) of the cathode material compared to the pristine material. The O 1s XPS data revealed that the presence of two different oxygen ions corresponds to the surface coated La2O3 and core material. ESCA depth profiles of the constituent elements in the coated particles showed their levels. A compact coating layer on the surface of the core material was observed from TEM image and had an average thickness of similar to 20 nm. Galvanostatic cycling studies suggest that 1.0 wt.% coated La2O3 on LiNi0.8Co0.2O2 quadrupled cycle stability over the pristine material. Impedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry demonstrated that the improved performance is attributed to a suppression of the impedance growth and cycle-limiting phase transitions.

AB Dynamic interactions between and within the biogeophysical and human environments lead to the production, processing, distribution, preparation and consumption of food, resulting in food systems that underpin food security. Food systems encompass food availability (production, distribution and exchange), food access (affordability, allocation and preference) and food utilization (nutritional and societal values and safety), so that food security is, therefore, diminished when food systems are stressed. Such stresses may be induced by a range of factors in addition to climate change and/or other agents of environmental change (e.g. conflict, HIV/AIDS) and may be particularly severe when these factors act in combination. Urbanization and globalization are causing rapid changes to food systems.
   Climate change may affect food systems in several ways ranging from direct effects on crop production (e.g. changes in rainfall leading to drought or flooding, or warmer or cooler temperatures leading to changes in the length of growing season), to changes in markets, food prices and supply chain infrastructure. The relative importance of climate change for food security differs between regions. For example, in southern Africa, climate is among the most frequently cited drivers of food insecurity because it acts both as an underlying, ongoing issue and as a short-lived shock. The low ability to cope with shocks and to mitigate long-term stresses means that coping strategies that might be available in other regions are unavailable or inappropriate. In other regions, though, such as parts of the Indo-Gangetic Plain of India, other drivers, such as labour issues and the availability and quality of ground water for irrigation, rank higher than the direct effects of climate change as factors influencing food security.
   Because of the multiple socio-economic and bio-physical factors affecting food systems and hence food security, the capacity to adapt food systems to reduce their vulnerability to climate change is not uniform. Improved systems of food production, food distribution and economic access may all contribute to food systems adapted to cope with climate change, but in adopting such changes it will be important to ensure that they contribute to sustainability. Agriculture is a major contributor of the greenhouse gases methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O), so that regionally derived policies promoting adapted food systems need to mitigate further climate change.

AB Although considerable achievements in the global reduction of hunger and poverty have been made, progress in Africa so far has been very limited. At present, a third of the African population faces widespread hunger and chronic malnutrition and is exposed to a constant threat of acute food crisis and famine. The most affected are rural households whose livelihood is heavily dependent on traditional rainfed agriculture. Rainfall plays a major role in determining agricultural production and hence the economic and social well being of rural communities. The rainfall pattern in sub-Saharan Africa is influenced by large-scale intra-seasonal and inter-annual climate variability including occasional El Nino events in the tropical Pacific resulting in frequent extreme weather event such as droughts and floods that reduce agricultural outputs resulting in severe food shortages. Households and communities facing acute food shortages are forced to adopt coping strategies to meet the immediate food requirements of their families. These extreme responses may have adverse long-term impacts on households' ability to have sustainable access to food as well as the environment. The HIV/AIDS crisis has also had adverse impacts on food production activities on the continent.
   In the absence of safety nets and appropriate financial support mechanisms, humanitarian aid is required to enable households effectively cope with emergencies and manage their limited resources more efficiently. Timely and appropriate humanitarian aid will provide households with opportunities to engage in productive and sustainable livelihood strategies. Investments in poverty reduction efforts would have better impact if complemented with timely and predictable response mechanisms that would ensure the protection of livelihoods during crisis periods whether weather or conflict-related. With an improved understanding of climate variability including El Nino, the implications of weather patterns for the food security and vulnerability of rural communities have become more predictable and can be monitored effectively. The purpose of this paper is to investigate how current advances in the understanding of climate variability, weather patterns and food security could contribute to improved humanitarian decision-making. The paper will propose new approaches for triggering humanitarian responses to weather-induced food crises.

AB Seasonal climate outlooks provide one tool to help decision-makers allocate resources in anticipation of poor, fair or good seasons. The aim of the 'Climate Outlooks and Agent-Based Simulation of Adaptation in South Africa' project has been to investigate whether individuals, who adapt gradually to annual climate variability, are better equipped to respond to longer-term climate variability and change in a sustainable manner. Seasonal climate outlooks provide information on expected annual rainfall and thus can be used to adjust seasonal agricultural strategies to respond to expected climate conditions. A case study of smallholder farmers in a village in Vhembe district, Limpopo Province, South Africa has been used to examine how such climate outlooks might influence agricultural strategies and how this climate information can be improved to be more useful to farmers. Empirical field data has been collected using surveys, participatory approaches and computer-based knowledge elicitation tools to investigate the drivers of decision-making with a focus on the role of climate, market and livelihood needs. This data is used in an agent-based social simulation which incorporates household agents with varying adaptation options which result in differing impacts on crop yields and thus food security, as a result of using or ignoring the seasonal outlook. Key variables are the skill of the forecast, the social communication of the forecast and the range of available household and community-based risk coping strategies. This research provides a novel approach for exploring adaptation within the context of climate change.

TI An economic way of reducing health, environmental, and other pressures
   of urban traffic: a decision analysis on trip aggregation
SO BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
AB Background: Traffic congestion is rapidly becoming the most important obstacle to urban development. In addition, traffic creates major health, environmental, and economical problems. Nonetheless, automobiles are crucial for the functions of the modern society. Most proposals for sustainable traffic solutions face major political opposition, economical consequences, or technical problems.
   Methods: We performed a decision analysis in a poorly studied area, trip aggregation, and studied decisions from the perspective of two different stakeholders, the passenger and society. We modelled the impact and potential of composite traffic, a hypothetical large-scale demand-responsive public transport system for the Helsinki metropolitan area, where a centralised system would collect the information on all trip demands online, would merge the trips with the same origin and destination into public vehicles with eight or four seats, and then would transmit the trip instructions to the passengers' mobile phones.
   Results: We show here that in an urban area with one million inhabitants, trip aggregation could reduce the health, environmental, and other detrimental impacts of car traffic typically by 50-70%, and if implemented could attract about half of the car passengers, and within a broad operational range would require no public subsidies.
   Conclusion: Composite traffic provides new degrees of freedom in urban decision-making in identifying novel solutions to the problems of urban traffic.

AB Pterocarpus angolensis is a hardwood species subject to heavy exploitation throughout miombo woodlands of south-central Africa. Rates of natural recruitment measured in western Tanzania were found to be low, with only a third of parent trees generating any seedlings despite considerable seed production. Although heavily protected areas supported large parent trees, these adults had very few seedlings of > 5 cm DBH nearby, possibly suggesting mortality caused by high densities of browsing ungulates. Outside these well protected areas, cutting has removed most large trees and remaining adults are small producing relatively few seeds. Factors affecting recruitment include location and elevation perhaps indicative of higher precipitation, whereas short grass and reduced parent canopy cover are associated with more seedlings suggesting competition for light. Given these recruitment rates, the prognosis for sustainable exploitation of P. angolensis looks bleak. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The interaction between a wetland (the Rochefort agricultural marsh) and its underlying aquifers was studied using both geochemical and isotopic approaches. Water from the various components of the hydrosystem (water from ditches, shallow 'Bri' groundwater (silty clay deposits), deep 'Bri' groundwater and groundwater in the Kimmeridgian aquifer (confined and unconfined) was sampled and analysed for major and trace elements (Sr, Br), stable water isotopes (O-18 and H-2) and Sr isotopes.
   The salinity of groundwater in the marsh (Cl up to 15.5 g/l) can be attributed to seawater trapped in the clay sediments during the Flandrian (12,000-6400 BP). The groundwater has since undergone more or less major chemical evolution due to water-rock interactions and mixing with fresh water (rainwater, ditch water and Kimmeridgian groundwater from the edge of the marsh). The chemical characteristics of the groundwater in the confined Kimmeridgian underlying the Bri formation exclude the possibility of a salt wedge. The combined use of delta O-18, delta H-2, Cl, Br and Sr contents and Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios enabled exchanges between surface water in marsh canals and ditches and groundwater in the shallow Bri aquifer ( < 2 m), and between groundwater in the deep Bri (> 7 m) and in the confined Kimmeridgian (> 18 m) aquifers, to be defined and quantified. During the summer, the ditches recharge the shallow Bri aquifer by sub-irrigation (gravity flow) by up to 26%. The presence of a very compact layer of clay, 1-2-m deep, prevents the rapid recharge of the deep Bri aquifer by rainfall and direct hydraulic connections between the ditches and the deep Bri aquifer. On the scale of the marsh, the confined Kimmeridgian groundwater recharges the Bri aquifer by upward flow (maximum contribution estimated to be 76 +/- 13%), this flow being relatively limited and preferentially on the edge of the marsh. The deep Bri groundwater contributes very locally to recharging the confined Kimmeridgian aquifer (maximum contribution estimated to be 61 +/- 36%). This study demonstrates the interest in combining hydrological and geochemical tools in order to identify and quantify the hydraulic interconnections between a wetland and its groundwater components. A prior understanding of how wetlands function is crucial for the sustainable management of such ecosystems. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB An experiment was completed to determine if copper oxide wire particles (COWP) had any effect on the activity of the nematode-trapping fungus Duddingtonia flagrans in growing lambs. COWP has been used recently as a dewormer in small ruminants because of nematode resistance to anthelmintics. D. flagrans has been used to control free-living stages of parasitic nematodes in livestock. Katahdin and Dorper lambs, 4 months of age, were administered no or 4 a COWP (it = 24/dose) in early October 2003. Haemonchus contortus was the predominant gastrointestinal parasite during the trial, which was acquired naturally from pasture. Half the lambs from each COWP group were supplemented with corn/soybean meal with or without D. flagrans for 35 days. Fecal egg counts (FEC) and packed cell volume (PCV) were determined weekly between days 0 (day of COWP administration) and 35. Feces from lambs in each treatment group were pooled and three replicates per group were cultured for 14 days at room temperature. Larvae (L3) were identified and counted per gram of feces cultured. Treatment with COWP was effective in decreasing FEC, which remained low compared with FEC from lambs not treated with COWP. This led to an increase in PCV in these lambs (COWP x day, P < 0.001). Number of larvae was decreased in feces from lambs treated with COWP and D. flagrans between days 14 and 35 compared to the other groups of lambs (COWP x D. flagrans x day, P < 0.003). Percentage of larvae identified as H. contortus decreased in feces collected from lambs treated with COWP and D. flagrans between days 14 and 28 compared with other treatments (COWP x D. flagrans x day, P < 0.05). Other trichostrongyles were present and remained less than 7% in feces collected from control lambs. There was no adverse effect of COWP on the ability of D. flagrans to trap residual larvae after COWP treatment. With fewer eggs being excreted due to the effect of copper on H. contortus, and the additional larval reducing effect exerted by the nematode destroying fungus D. flagrans, the expected result would be a much lower larval challenge on pasture when these two tools are used together in a sustainable control strategy.

TI Sustaining an Aboriginal mental health service partnership

ID SUSTAINABILITY
AB The Regional Aboriginal Integrated Social and Emotional (RAISE) Wellbeing program commenced in February 2003 as an Aboriginal mental health service partnership between one Aboriginal Health Service and three mainstream services: a community mental health team, a hospital mental health liaison, and an "outback" community counselling service.
   A case study method was used to describe the drivers (incentives for program development), linkage processes (structures and activities through which the partnership operated), and sustainability of the program.
   Program drivers were longstanding problems with Aboriginal peoples' access to mental health care, policy direction favouring shared service responsibility, and a relatively small amount of new funding for mental health that allowed the program to commence.
   Linkage processes were the important personal relationships between key individuals. Developing the program as a part of routine practice within and across the partner organisations is now needed through formal agreements, common care-management tools, and training.
   The program's sustainability will depend on this development occurring, as well as better collection and use of data to communicate the value of the program and support calls for adequate recurrent funds. The development of care-management tools, training and data systems will require a longer period of start-up funding as well as some external expertise.

TI Implementation of a SNAP intervention in two divisions of general
   practice: a feasibility study
SO MEDICAL JOURNAL OF AUSTRALIA
LA English
DT Article
ID ADVICE; ADULTS; TRIAL
AB "SNAP" is a model for the general practice management of four common behavioural risk factors: smoking, nutrition, alcohol and physical activity. The SNAP program was developed for the Australian Government in 2002.
   In 2003 and 2004, a feasibility study was conducted in one urban and one rural division of general practice (DGP) in NSW, in partnership with their local area health services.
   Information technology support and referral directories were developed, based on an initial needs assessment, SNAP guidelines, a clinical summary chart, patient education materials, and general practitioner and staff training.
   GPs reported that the SNAP approach fitted general practice consultations well. After its implementation, they were more confident in using motivational interviewing and SNAP interventions and referred more frequently.
   The impact and sustainability of the SNAP program were limited by a lack of effective practice teamwork, poor linkages with referral services, and the lack of a business model to support SNAP in the practices.
   DGPs could play an important role in providing practice visits and resources to improve communication, education and collaboration to support SNAP programs.

   projects: implications for sustainability
SO MEDICAL JOURNAL OF AUSTRALIA
LA English

ID COGNITIVE-BEHAVIOR THERAPY; COST-EFFECTIVENESS; GENERAL-PRACTICE;
   DEPRESSION; INTERVENTIONS
AB We evaluated an Internet-based psychological intervention supported by either general practitioners or psychologists (Panic Online), and a Primary-care Evidence-based Psychological-interventions (PEP) strategy which involves training GPs to deliver specific psychological interventions.
   Economic modelling suggests that Panic Online is cost-effective when supported by either GPs or psychologists.
   Threshold analysis of the psychological training of GPs suggests that a modest effect size for clinical benefit would be sufficient to provide an acceptable cost-effectiveness ratio.
   The sustainability of these approaches depends on a range of factors, including funding, workforce availability, and acceptability to consumers and health care providers.

TI Caring for a marginalised community: the costs of engaging with culture
   and complexity
SO MEDICAL JOURNAL OF AUSTRALIA
LA English
DT Article
ID AUSTRALIA
AB The Care and Prevention Programme (CPP) began in 1998. It is based on the philosophy of primary health care, and has improved health among homosexually active men, including about a third of HIV-positive South Australians.
   The CPP was assessed using financial analysis and qualitative methods. Participants wanted to access care where they could feel comfortable and safe to talk about issues of sexuality and lifestyle.
   The CPP model is "economically" sustainable, but not "financially" sustainable within the Medicare Benefits Schedule. It is vulnerable to changes in political environment.
   The financing model for the CPP has been adapted by including state funding. General practitioners have adapted by lowering their personal incomes (but not quality of care). These adaptations have achieved fragile financial viability.
   Facilitators of sustainability for the CPP included:
   It is part of the community that it serves;,
   The creation of deeply integrated networks of diversity-competent service providers; and
   "Virtuous non-adaptability" of service providers in refusing to compromise care standards despite financial pressure to do so.
   Threats to sustainability included:
   Difficulty maintaining a diversity-competent workforce skilled in HIV medicine;
   Marginal financial viability; and
   Political vulnerability.

ID ORGANIZATIONS
AB A synthesis of the findings of the five studies of sustainability of primary health care innovation across six domains (political, institutional, financial, economic, client and workforce) yielded three main themes. These were:
   the importance of social relationships, networks and champions;
   the effect of political, financial and societal forces; and,
   the motivation and capacity of agents within the system.
   The need for routine assessment of the sustainability of primary health care innovations is discussed.
   Given the dearth of literature on the sustainability of primary health care innovation, there is potential to develop a program of research directed towards a future synthesis of evidence.

TI Sustainable chronic disease management in remote Australia

DT Article
ID SELF-MANAGEMENT; CARE
AB The Sharing Health Care Initiative (SHCI) demonstration project, which aimed to improve management of chronic diseases, was implemented in four small remote communities in the Katherine region which are serviced by the Katherine West Health Board, a remote Aboriginal-community-controlled health organisation in the Northern Territory.
   We reviewed the project proposal, final report, evaluation reports and transitional funding proposal, and supplemented these with in-depth interviews with key individuals. We determined factors critical to the sustainability of the SHCI project in relation to context, community engagement, systems flexibility and adaptability, the availability and effect of information systems, and the human nature of health care and policy.
   The project had a significant impact on community awareness of chronic disease and an improvement in clinic processes.
   We found that a number of interrelated factors promoted sustainability, including:
   An implementation strategy sufficiently flexible to take account of local conditions;
   A high level of community engagement;
   Appropriate timeframes, timing and congruence between national policy and local readiness to implement a chronic disease project;
   Effective communication between participating organisations; Project champions (key individuals) in participating organisations; Effective use of monitoring and evaluation data; and
   Adequate and ongoing funding.
   The absence of a number of these factors, such as poor communication, inhibited sustainability. Other factors could both promote and inhibit. For example, the impact of key individuals was important, but could be idiosyncratic and have negative effects.

AB Up-to-date information on the distribution and changes associated with wetlands is essential for their effective conservation and management. Satellite remote sensing is arguably the,,only practical way for mapping and monitoring wetlands in a timely manner over. a large area, and therefore has been chosen by the Canadian Wetland Inventory (CWI) initiative to map Canada's wetlands and by the Environment and Sustainable Development Indicators (ESDI) initiative to monitor the extent of wetland indicators. As a contribution to these initiatives, this paper presents. a, rule based wetland mapping method using Landsat-7/ETM+, two-season Radarsat-1/SAR images and DEM data. Three study sites in eastern Canada were selected to test this new method. The test results indicate that the classification accuracy of the new method ranges from 71% to 92%, for open bog, open fen; treed bog, marsh and swamp at the three sites. In comparison, two traditional methods based on Landsat-7/ETM+ alone or both Landsat-7/ETM+ and Radarsat-1/SAR have accuracies of 24-89% and 78-85%,, respectively.

TI Chronic diseases 4 - Preventing chronic diseases in China
SO LANCET
LA English
DT Article
AB Chronic diseases now account for an estimated 80% of deaths and 70% of disability-adjusted life-years lost in China. Cardiovascular diseases and cancer are the leading causes of both death and the burden of disease, and exposure to risk factors is high: more than 300 million men smoke cigarettes and 160 million adults are hypertensive, most of whom are not being treated. An obesity epidemic is imminent, with more than 20% of children aged 7-17 years in big cities now overweight or obese. The government of the People's Republic of China must confront these major challenges. The national cancer prevention and control plan (2004-10) is being implemented, and a national chronic disease prevention and control plan is due to be completed this year. Encouraging progress has been made in some areas, with current smoking prevalence in men declining at about 1% per year for a decade, and even better results in large demonstration programmes. Much remains to be done, and resources and sustainability are major issues. However, the surveillance and intervention mechanisms needed to ameliorate the increasing burden of chronic diseases are developing rapidly, taking account of the lessons learned over the past two decades.

TI Maximum elastic deformations of compact stars with exotic equations of
   state
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
LA English
DT Article
ID NEUTRON-STARS; PULSAR; SGR-1806-20; STARQUAKES; MATTER; FLARE
AB I make the first estimates of maximum elastic quadrupole deformations sustainable by alternatives to conventional neutron stars. Solid strange quark stars might sustain maximum ellipticities (dimensionless quadrupoles) up to a few times 10(-4) rather than a few times 10(-7) for conventional neutron stars, and hybrid quark-baryon or meson-condensate stars might sustain up to 10(-5). Most of the difference is due to the shear modulus, which can be up to 10(33) erg/cm(3) rather than 10(30) erg/cm(3) in the inner crust of a conventional neutron star. Maximum solid strange star ellipticities are comparable to upper limits obtained for several known pulsars in a recent gravitational-wave search by LIGO. Maximum ellipticities of the more robust hybrid model will be detectable by LIGO at initial design sensitivity. A large shear modulus also strengthens the case for starquakes as an explanation for frequent pulsar glitches.

TI Global pattern of trends in streamflow and water availability in a
   changing climate
SO NATURE
LA English
DT Article
AB Water availability on the continents is important for human health(1,2), economic activity(3), ecosystem function(4) and geophysical processes(5). Because the saturation vapour pressure of water in air is highly sensitive to temperature, perturbations in the global water cycle are expected to accompany climate warming(6). Regional patterns of warming-induced changes in surface hydroclimate are complex and less certain than those in temperature, however, with both regional increases and decreases expected in precipitation and runoff. Here we show that an ensemble of 12 climate models exhibits qualitative and statistically significant skill in simulating observed regional patterns of twentieth-century multidecadal changes in streamflow. These models project 10-40% increases in runoff in eastern equatorial Africa, the La Plata basin and high-latitude North America and Eurasia, and 10-30% decreases in runoff in southern Africa, southern Europe, the Middle East and mid-latitude western North America by the year 2050. Such changes in sustainable water availability would have considerable regional-scale consequences for economies as well as ecosystems.

AB More and more frequently policy-makers are urged to assess the impact of their strategies and policies in terms of sustainable development. This necessitates the use of applied scientific models as tools for identifying and evaluating the likely environmental, economic and social impacts of alternative policies. The objective of this paper is to provide a framework to help decision-makers choose the most appropriate-or the most appropriate mix-of models, by assessing their relative strengths and weaknesses. The paper also allows potential improvements in modeling techniques to be identified. Six modeling paradigms are assessed, both on a general basis and with respect to two specific policy contexts (energy policy, and land use and transport planning). (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB Little is known about nutrient fluxes as a criterion to assess the sustainability of traditional irrigation agriculture in eastern Arabia. In this study GIS-based field research on terraced cropland and groves of date palm (Phoenix dactylifera L.) was conducted over 2 years in two mountain oases of northern Oman to determine their role as hypothesized sinks for nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K). At Balad Seet 55% of the 385 fields received annual inputs of 100-500 kg N ha(-1) and 26% received 500-1400 kg N ha(-1). No N was applied to 19% of the fields which were under fallow. Phosphorus was applied annually at 1-90 kg ha(-1) on 46% of the fields, whereas 27% received 90-210 kg ha(-1). No K was applied to 27% of the fields, 32% received 1-300 kg K ha(-1), and the remaining fields received up to 1400 kg ha(-1). At Maqta N-inputs were 61-277 kg ha(-1) in palm groves and 112-225 kg ha(-1) in wheat (Triticum spp.) fields, respective P inputs were 9-40 and 14-29 kg ha(-1), and K inputs were 98-421 and 113-227 kg ha(-1). For cropland, partial oasis balances (comprising inputs of manure, mineral fertilizers, N-2-fixation and irrigation water, and outputs of harvested products) were similar for both oases, with per hectare surpluses of 131 kg N, 37 kg P, and 84 kg K at Balad Sect and of 136 kg N, 16 kg P and 66 kg K at Maqta. This was despite the fact that N2-fixation by alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), estimated at up to 480 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) with an average total dry matter of 22 t ha(-1), contributed to the cropland N-balance only at the former site. Respective palm grove surpluses, in contrast were with 303 kg N, 38 kg P, and 173 kg K ha(-1) much higher at Balad Sect than with 84 kg N, 14 kg P, and 91 kg K ha(-1) at Maqta. The data show that both oases presently are large sinks for nutrients. Potential gaseous and leaching losses could at least partly be controlled by a decrease in nutrient input intensity and careful incorporation of manure. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All fights reserved.

   mesocosm
SO AQUACULTURE

ID MEDITERRANEAN SEA; GROWTH
AB Species diversification is considered a major approach for the sustainable development of aquaculture. The greater amberjack (Seriola dumerili) has particular characteristics-advantages making it an appropriate candidate: high growth rate, large size, and established worldwide market. In the present study, the mesocosm method for larval rearing was applied, since it has been shown to be effective in the larval rearing of several species so far. This method is a semi-intensive technology, based on daily exogenous food addition, but also having the capacity of some endogenous productivity. Greater amberjack eggs were obtained from wild-caught fish matured in captivity in 6 years, after induced spawning with implants containing gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa). A total of 9800 eggs survived after embryo appearance and were incubated in a 40-m(3) tank with natural seawater of 40 psu. Rearing lasted 40 days. After mouth opening on day 2 post hatching, exogenous feeding with rotifers, Artemia nauplii and inert feed was initiated, while endogenous produced copepods contributed as food for the larvae from day 7 post hatching onwards. During rearing, larvae grew with an exponential rate of 0.073 day(-1) in terms of total length (TL), and reached 39.9 +/- 5.4 min and 0.5 +/- 0.1 g body weight at the end of the trial. All larvae inflated their swim bladder and completed metamorphosis at about 5 turn and 8 nun TL, respectively. Schooling behavior was first observed when larvae reached 9-10 mm TL, while aggression against the smallest individuals was first noticed the same period. The final population of about 350 individuals (3.5% survival) was transferred at the end of the trial for subsequent on-growing. The results obtained indicate the reliability of the technology for the larval rearing of the greater amberjack, and also its appropriateness for diversification with difficult marine species.

AB This paper is a review of the methodology of palaeoflood hydrology. In particular, we focus on recent developments and the credibility of the palaeoflood data produced. The use of slackwater flood deposits as a physical record of water surface elevations reached by past floods enables the calculation of robust palaeodischarge estimates for floods that occurred during recent centuries or millennia. Over these time intervals the chronological precision from numerical age dating, such as radiocarbon, is sufficient for the structuring of the palaeoflood discharge data into different threshold levels that are exceeded by floodwaters over specific periods of time, the input data necessary for new methodologies of flood frequency analysis. The value of palaeoflood hydrology to hydrological sciences is discussed through its application in varying multidisciplinary research themes. We demonstrate the use of palaeoflood hydrology in: (1) flood risk estimation; (2) determination of the maximum limit of flood magnitude and non-exceedances as a check of the probable maximum flood (PMF) and its application in producing regional, long-term envelope curves; (3) Holocene climatic variability and (4) assessing sustainability of water resources in dryland environments where floods are an important source of water to alluvial aquifers.

AB Within the Research Network on Agro-ecosystems Munich (Forschungsverbund Agrarokosysteme Munchen, FAM) strategies to approach optimal land use have been investigated since 1990 in terms of minimization of environmental impacts and maximization of profit from agricultural lands. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the interactions of the economic and ecological demands on agricultural land use with model calculations for the integrated farm section of the research station of the Research Network, Klostergut Scheyern in Bavaria, Germany, with a whole farm modeling approach.
   For this purpose the model system MODAM was used. MODAM simulates agricultural land use at farm level, calculates the economic returns and environmental impacts and runs farm optimizations with a linear programming tool. The integration of agri-environmental indicators in the model framework enables a multi-criteria optimization and the calculation of trade-offs. Optimization runs for the experimental farm show the complex interactions which occur when the farm considers environmental concerns in the objective function. Trade offs and abatement cost curves illustrate the relationship between agri-environmental indicators and economic returns of the farm. Here, soil erosion, nitrogen balance, global warming potential and gross energy input were implemented as agri-environmental indicators in MODAM. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Family composition and its changes over time are believed to have a major impact on the welfare and sustainability of small-scale, limited resource farm households. In order to understand and test the effects of household composition on overall farm household well-being, a simulation model was developed based on information from 60 small farms from the Coastal Canete Valley, Peru. The model accounts dynamically for the birth, age and death of household members and for crop, livestock, and economic activities. A representative farm with ten scenarios representing the range of household composition was simulated. Results in 10, 20 and 40-year runs showed that family composition has a large influence on economic stress. Families with fewer members were economically better off after 10, 20, and even 40 years. With more young or very old members, the expenses and consumption requirements exceeded the benefits from the additional labor, and debt was greater and of longer duration. Changing prices and yields across their observed ranged of variability influenced simulated financial position, but not the ranking of results among household composition scenarios.

ID SUSTAINABILITY; SYSTEMS
AB The processes of nutrient depletion and soil degradation that limit productivity of smallholder African farms are spatially heterogeneous. Causes of variability in soil fertility management at different scales of analysis are both biophysical and socioeconomic. Such heterogeneity is categorised in this study, which quantifies its impact on nutrient flows and soil fertility status at region and farm scales, as a first step in identifying spatial and temporal niches for targeting of soil fertility management strategies and technologies. Transects for soil profile observation, participatory rural appraisal techniques and classical soil sampling and chemical analysis were sampled across 60 farms in three sub-locations (Emuhaia, Shinyalu, Aludeka), which together represent much of the variability found in the highlands of western Kenya. Five representative farm types were identified using socio-economic information and considering production activities, household objectives and the main constraints faced by farmers. Soil fertility management and nutrient resource flows were studied for each farm type and related to differences in soil fertility status at farm scale. Farm types 1 and 2 were the wealthiest; the former relied on off-farm income and farmed small pieces of land (0.6-1.1 ha) while the latter farmed relatively large land areas (1.6-3.8 ha) mainly with cash crops. The poorest farm type 5 also farmed small pieces of land (0.4-1.0 ha) but relied on low wages derived from working for wealthier farmers. Both farm types 1 and 5 relied on off-farm earnings and sold the least amounts of farm produce to the market, though the magnitude of their cash, labour and nutrient flows was contrasting. Farms of types 3 and 4 were intermediate in size and wealth, and represented different crop production strategies for self-consumption and the market. Average grain yields fluctuated around 1 t ha(-1) year(-1) for all farm types and sub-locations. Grain production by farms of types 4 and 5 was much below annual family requirements, estimated at 170 kg person(-1) year(-1). Household wealth and production orientation affected the pattern of resource flow at farm scale. In the land-constrained farms of type 1, mineral fertilisers were often used more intensively (ca. 50 kg ha(-1)), though with varying application rates (14-92 kg ha(-1)). The use of animal manure in such small farms (e.g. 2.2 t year(-1)) represented intensities of use of up to 8 t ha(-1), and a net accumulation of C and macronutrients brought into the farm by livestock. In farms of type 5, intensities of use of mineral and organic fertilisers ranged between 0-12 kg ha(-1) and 0-0.5 t ha(-1), respectively. A consistent trend of decreasing input use from farm types 1-5 was generally observed, but nutrient resources and land management practices (e.g. fallow) differed enormously between sub-locations. Inputs of nutrients were almost nil in Aludeka farms. Both inherent soil properties and management explained the variability found in soil fertility status. Texture explained the variation observed in soil C and related total N between sub-locations, whereas P availability varied mainly between farm types as affected by input use. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

TI Mainstreaming HIV/AIDS in development sectors: Have we learnt the
   lessons from gender mainstreaming?
SO AIDS CARE-PSYCHOLOGICAL AND SOCIO-MEDICAL ASPECTS OF AIDS/HIV
LA English
DT Article
AB Drawing on an international literature review, two international workshops and primary qualitative research in Uganda this paper reviews experiences of mainstreaming HIV/ AIDS in development sectors ( such as education, health and agriculture) in developing countries. The extent to which HIV/ AIDS mainstreaming strategies and associated challenges are similar to or different from those of mainstreaming gender in the health sector is also explored. The paper details the rationale for HIV/ AIDS mainstreaming through illustrating the wide reaching effects of the pandemic. Despite the increasing interest in mainstreaming HIV/ AIDS there is little clarity on what it actually means in theory or practice. This paper presents a working definition of HIV/ AIDS mainstreaming. It is argued that all too often processes of ` mainstreaming' emerge as too narrow and reductionist to be effective. The paper then considers four key challenges for mainstreaming HIV/ AIDS and explores how and to what extent they have also been faced in gender mainstreaming and what can be learnt from these experiences. These are: ( 1) the limited evidence base upon which to build mainstreaming strategies in different country contexts; ( 2) the role of donors in mainstreaming and implications for sustainability; ( 3) who should take responsibility for mainstreaming; and ( 4) how to develop capacity for mainstreaming. The conclusion argues for more joined up thinking and sustainable approaches to mainstreaming both HIV/ AIDS and gender.

TI The Water Framework Directive: Stakeholder preferences and catchment
   management strategies - Are they reconcilable?
SO AMBIO
LA English
DT Article
AB The key objective of the European Water Framework Directive (WFD) is to promote sustainable water use by protecting water resources. Here, we investigate how the economic consequences of a set of water management regulations is received by a group of stakeholders in the Ronnea catchment. We explore three themes from an economic point of view: i) perceived causes of eutrophication, ii) preferences regarding water use, and iii) the extent to which the polluter-pays principle should be applied. There is a common understanding about the intentions in the WFD to enhance cost-effective water use. All stakeholder groups largely share a similar picture of the causes of water quality deterioration. However, there is not one cost-effective and fair solution. Several mixes of remedial measures within the same catchment are possible, depending on the scale of action. Despite potential economic gains from cooperation between sectors, the participants regard the individual polluter-pays principle as the most feasible mode of funding for remedial programs, supported by subsidies. There is little demand for more market institutions (emission fees, tradable emission permits). The stakeholders have a conservative view of water management, i.e. they accept the present combination of regulations and economic incentives, and they are fully aware of the complexity of the issue. In general, the WFD recommendations for the calculation of cost-effective abatement strategies seem to imply an underestimation of the value of external effects in the decision-making process.

AB A two-year experiment was conducted at the Beltsville Agricultural Research Center (BARC), MD, and Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University Kentland Agricultural Research Farm (KARF), VA, to evaluate potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) production of 32- to 57-mm-size-range tubers (referred to hereafter as creamers) in a conservation-tillage, cover-cropping strategy. The experiments used a split-plot design in which the main-plots were cover crop treatments and the sub-plots were different potato selections. Main plot treatments included rye (Secale cereale L.), crimson clover (Trifolium incarnatum L.), Austrian winter pea (Pisum sativum L.), rape (Brassica napus L.), oat (Avena sativa L.), rye/crimson clover mixture, rape/crimson clover mixture, bare soil/raised beds, and bare soil/flat beds (control). Potato selections tested were B1145-2, B1491-5, and B1492-12 in 2000 and B1145-2, B1102-3, and B0811-4 in 2001. Yields in the conservation-tillage treatments were equal to or better than those in the bare soil/flat bed control with few exceptions. Large-sized tubers (< 57 mm) in almost all cases remained below 6% of total marketable yield even when the tubers were harvested late. Delayed harvest did not reduce creamer-sized yields nor did it increase yield of large-sized tubers. Economic analysis shows that net returns from some conservation-tillage treatments are equal to or higher than the conventional-tillage strategy and confirms the viability of the conservation-tillage, cover-cropping strategy. Furthermore, the conservation-tillage strategy in many cases allows timely planting using machinery in the wet soils of Maryland and Virginia during the narrow window of spring potato planting time, whereas the conventional tillage strategy does not offer this advantage.

AB A plan for sustainable management is urgently required for cork oak forests. This objective is only attainable through growth models that allow us to predict the medium and long term consequences of different silvicultural treatments. In this study, we have developed height and diameter growth models for dominant cork oak trees using stem analysis data from two of the main cork producing areas in Spain. Difference forms of the Lundqvist- Korf, McDill- Amateis and Richards growth functions were tested and fitted using the generalized least squares regression method. The parameters of the equations were linked to stand characteristics in order to improve the models. The difference form of the McDill- Amateis equation was selected for height growth, while the difference form of the Richards equation with n as the free parameter was selected for diameter growth. These models increase our knowledge of the growth of this species and therefore will enable us to improve management planning in cork oak forests.

AB OBJECTIVE: To describe Australia's community pharmacy network in the context of the health system and outline the provision of services.
   DATA SYNTHESIS: The 5000 community pharmacies form a key component of the healthcare system for Australians, for whom health expenditures represent 9% of the Gross Domestic Product. A typical community pharmacy dispenses 880 prescriptions per week. Pharmacists are key partners in the Government's National Medicines Policy and contribute to its objectives through the provision of cognitive pharmaceutical services (CPS). The Third Community Pharmacy Agreement included funding for CPS including medication review and the provision of written drug information. Funding is also provided for a quality assurance platform with which the majority of pharmacies are accredited. Fifteen million dollars (Australian) have been allocated to research in community pharmacy, which has focused on achieving quality use of medicines (QUM), as well as developing new CPS and facilitating change. Elements of the Agreements have taken into account QUM principles and are now significant drivers of practice change. Although accounting for 10% of remuneration for community pharmacy, the provision of CPS represents a significant shift in focus to view pharmacy as a service provider. Delivery of CPS through the community pharmacy network provides sustainability for primary health care due to improvement in quality presumably associated with a reduction in healthcare costs.
   CONCLUSIONS: Australian pharmacy practice is moving strongly in the direction of CPS provision; however, change does not occur easily. The development of a change management strategy is underway to improve the uptake of professional and business opportunities in community pharmacy.

AB Objective: To assess methods to calculate achieving and sustaining remission in a double blind randomised trial in patients with RA who received etanercept, methotrexate, or an etanercept/methotrexate combination.
   Methods: Remission was defined as DAS < 1.6, DAS28 < 2.6, and ACR70 response. Sustaining remission was analysed in three ways: (a) analysis of sustained DAS remission, DAS28 remission, or ACR70 response continuously for 6 months; (b) analysis of sustained remission appraised through a continuity rewarded scoring system, which is the weighted sum of all intervals in the study in which patients are in DAS or DAS28 remission; or (c) longitudinal modelling of remission odds using generalised estimating equations.
   Results: Significantly more patients treated with the etanercept/methotrexate combination reached DAS remission (37%) than those treated with either methotrexate (14%) or etanercept (18%) alone (p < 0.01). Results for DAS28 and for the ACR70 response were similar. Agreement between DAS remission and DAS28 remission was good, but agreement between either of these and the ACR70 response was less. Patients in DAS or DAS28 remission had a lower level of disease activity (fewer active joints, lower ESR) than those achieving ACR70 response; the converse was seen using pain VAS. The three methods were comparable for sustainability of remission and showed significant advantage for combination therapy, which increased the number and durability of remission periods.
   Conclusions: DAS and DAS28 remission results were similar for assessing achieving and sustaining remission in RA, frequently differing from patients classified as ACR70 responders. The three methods of examining duration of remission produced comparable results.

AB In this paper, contemporary bleaching is discussed in an environmental context. Both Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) and Elemental Chlorine Free (ECF) bleaching concepts are covered, and the literature on the toxicity of various concepts is reviewed. Special attention is paid to ozone, considering how to use it in both an efficient and a selective way. It is concluded that ozone could be used in both ECF and TCF sequences, but that the most attractive implementation of ozone bleaching is in a TCF sequence for hardwood kraft pulp. Moreover, laboratory trials seem to indicate a better selectivity of medium consistency over high consistency ozone bleaching, probably because water acts as a protective layer around the pulp fibres. In comparison with hot chlorine dioxide bleaching technology, ozone seems not to be the first choice for the bleaching of hardwood kraft pulp as long as TCF bleaching is not considered an end in itself.

AB Rhizobia, the root-nodule endosymbionts of leguminous plants, also form natural endophytic associations with roots of important cereal plants. Despite its widespread occurrence, much remains unknown about colonization of cereals by rhizobia. We examined the infection, dissemination, and colonization of healthy rice plant tissues by four species of gfp-tagged rhizobia and their influence on the growth physiology of rice. The results indicated a dynamic infection process beginning with surface colonization of the rhizoplane (especially at lateral root emergence), followed by endophytic colonization within roots, and then ascending endophytic migration into the stem base, leaf sheath, and leaves where they developed high populations. In situ CMEIAS image analysis indicated local endophytic population densities reaching as high as 9 X 10(10) rhizobia per cm(3) of infected host tissues, whereas plating experiments indicated rapid, transient or persistent growth depending on the rhizobial strain and rice tissue examined. Rice plants inoculated with certain test strains of gfp-tagged rhizobia produced significantly higher root and shoot biomass; increased their photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, transpiration velocity, water utilization efficiency, and flag leaf area (considered to possess the highest photosynthetic activity); and accumulated higher levels of indoleacetic acid and gibberellin growth-regulating phytohormones. Considered collectively, the results indicate that this endophytic plant-bacterium association is far more inclusive, invasive, and dynamic than previously thought, including dissemination in both below-ground and above-ground tissues and enhancement of growth physiology by several rhizobial species, therefore heightening its interest and potential value as a biofertilizer strategy for sustainable agriculture to produce the world's most important cereal crops.

AB The fibrillation of pulp fiber was attempted by two methods, a high-pressure homogenizer treatment and a grinder treatment. The grinder treatment resulted in the successful fibrillation of wood pulp fibers into nanofibers. The nanofibers demonstrate promising characteristics as reinforcement material for optically transparent composites. Due to the size effect, the nanofiber-reinforced composite retains the transparency of the matrix resin even at high fiber content such as 70 wt %. Since the nanofiber is an aggregate of semi-crystalline extended cellulose chains, its addition also contributes to a significant improvement in the thermal expansion properties of plastics while maintaining its ease of bending. Cellulose nanofibers have tremendous potential as a future resource since they are produced in a sustainable manner by plants, one of the most abundant organic resources on earth.

TI Energy mix and employment effects
SO ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER
LA German
DT Article
AB '' Energy Mix and Employment Effects '' is a subject not to be reduced to the so-called '' job argument ''. It also involves the question whether it will be possible to achieve consensus again about the composition of a balanced sustainable energy mix. This term must not be interpreted in a static sense; after all, the framework conditions of energy policy are changing. However, this must not render energy policy unsteady. This requirement should be imposed on economic policy in general, i.e. political interventions, if they are really unavoidable, must be predictable on a long term.
   This contribution also examines the meaning of the term '' energy mix.'' Aspects of the debate about the climate, especially potential factors influencing the climate, are discussed against the backdrop of scientific validity.
   Other key points covered are the description and analysis of the energy policy framework. One major aspect under study are all kinds of '' subsidies '' of, energy resources and the consequences to the whole economy arising from these financial support mechanisms. The findings are projected onto the employment effects.
   Finally, the question is raised how to design an energy mix sustainable for the future, and how to achieve it politically and in society.

TI Fuel development influenced by sustainability
SO ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER
LA German
DT Article
AB Sustainability is an issue gaining in importance in more and more areas. The term '' sustainable development '' was defined in 1987 by the Brundtland Commission of the UN in its report '' Our common Juture '' as '' the capacity to meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs ''. In concrete terms this also means, for example, minimizing the consumption of primary energy resources. This is a point that is gaining in importance against the backdrop of finite reserves and increasing prices for raw materials.
   The consumption of resources can be limited in different ways. In the case of the uranium fuel used in nuclear power plants this is achieved through enhanced fuel utilization, which is quantified as fuel burnup, namely is the energy derived from a specific amount of fuel.
   In cooperation with customers and licensing authorities Framatome ANP, in which the leading French nuclear engineering company AREVA has a 66 percent stake and Siemens 34 percent, achieves significantly extended burnups for pressurized and boiling water reactor fuel: In the course of the last 25 years the burnup of the leading reload fuel batch supplied by Framatome ANP was extended by more than 60 percent.
   These extended burnups were made possible by advanced fuel designs, dimensionally stable fuels and material alloys for cladding tubes and structural parts with excellent mechanical properties and high corrosion resistance. Examples include the ATRIUM (TM) design and LTP (low-temperature process) cladding material for boiling water reactors, and the M5 (TM) cladding material for pressurized water reactors.

The 2005 Energy Forum debated the topic of '' Nuclear Power - Competing for a Sustainable Energy; Supply in Europe?'' In this way, not only the members of the Forum were offered all opportunity to discuss this topical subject. Ambitious goals of carbon dioxide reduction, rising prices of raw materials and energy, and the construction of a new nuclear power plant in Finland have caused many countries to reconsider the role of nuclear power in meeting future problems.
   Four keynote papers dealt with this topic from different perspectives.
   A panel discussion provided a possibility of in-depth discussion with other partners.

TI Sustainable housing development in urban Australia: exploring obstacles

SO AUSTRALIAN GEOGRAPHER
LA English
DT Article
DE sustainability; affordability; housing; ecocity; cohousing; community
   development
AB Basic aspects of sustainable housing design such as increasing density, mixed use and proximity to public transport are being adopted increasingly in Australian cities. Sustainable building codes such as NSW's BASIX and Victoria's Green Star rating systems are also being implemented and advanced. More substantial improvements and endeavours such as onsite food production, energy generation and waste treatment, are being seen increasingly as necessary for urban sustainability, yet little is being done to institutionalise or normalise these through Australia's housing system. Similarly, concerns about the social sustainability of housing identify the need for mixed, flexible tenure and dwelling types, with again little uptake despite evidence of demand. Given that we seem to know what needs doing to move towards sustainability, this paper investigates two ecologically and socially sound community-based housing developments in Australia, with a view to finding what helped or hindered these efforts and what may further the uptake of sustainable design. Assessment of the uptake of sustainable planning initiatives reveals the prevalence of a decidedly neoliberal agenda which shies away from the more substantial challenges ecocity design and community-based enterprise may represent. Such community-based initiatives must, however, be supported at a broader scale, to avoid possible outsourcing of governmental responsibility or the relegation of sustainable design to the sole realm of the wealthy.

DE Murray-Darling Basin; natural resource management; engagement;
   participation; environmental education; community
AB Emerging approaches to environmental governance require a greater level of community participation than did previous approaches in which these responsibilities largely rested with government agencies. There is consequently a need for increased engagement with NRM among a broad community sector. This paper examines initiatives by two prominent government agencies, the Murray - Darling Basin Commission (MDBC) and the National Museum of Australia (NMA), to engage school children from regional communities using education programs that focus on place and environmental health. We focus on the MDBC's International Riverhealth Conference held in Mildura in 2003 and the associated Murray - Darling Basin TalkBack Classroom sponsored by the NMA and the Parliamentary Education Office (PEO). We explore how key themes of local scale, place-based identities, youth voice and critical engagement are developed in these programs and consider how they relate to the environmental agency of children. We then reflect on the potential for the kinds of environmental agency promoted through these programs to help build the capacity of local communities to progress larger goals of environmental restoration and sustainability in the Murray - Darling Basin. The evaluation research reported here forms part of the Committing to Place research project, an Australian Research Council Linkage grant involving the University of Tasmania, the National Museum of Australia and the Murray - Darling Basin Commission.

AB The exploitation of South American river turtles as a food source has long been considered the main factor contributing to the decline of populations. Along a stretch of the Aguarico River (Ecuador), we investigated the spatial and temporal distribution of terecay (Podocnemis unifilis) nests, factors affecting nest outcome, and the effect of offering a reward for each hatchling captured on the pattern of egg consumption by the local human community. Flooding influence oil egg mortality appears to be particularly important in this Amazonian region, destroying 63.1%, of all nests. This amount of nests resulted more than sufficient to satisfy the local community's consumption needs (28.2%). The proposed reward for cacti hatchling ensured the voluntary participation of the Cofan people in the terecay conservation project, leading to: (i) nests being harvested only from sites where there were likely no hatching possibilities, (ii) efficient management and protection of nesting beaches with abolition of poaching of nests and adult females, and (iii) transplantation of nests from sites that would be flooded (and whose yield exceeds human consumption). Therefore, we argue that in this area of Aguarico River there are both biologically and socially favourable conditions for the establishment of a sustainable harvest of terecay eggs. Possible factors determining high nest mortality due to flooding ill this area, as well as opportunities to make the project evolve toward economic self-sustainability, will also be discussed.

AB Understanding the factors driving demand for wild meat and its substitutes is crucial for predicting the effects of changing socioeconomic conditions on consumption, and managing supplies sustainably. However urban demand for wild meat remains relatively understudied, particularly in West/Central Africa. We use interviews with consumers in households, markets and restaurants and a market survey to examine patterns of consumption of bushmeat, domestic meat and fish in Bata, Equatorial Guinea, a country currently undergoing a period of strong economic and population growth. Consumers, make a much clearer distinction between fresh and frozen foods than between bushmeat, domestic meat and fish. Fresh foods are greatly preferred over frozen but are more expensive and less consumed. Consumption of all fresh foods increases with income. Controlling for income, native Equatoguineans consume more bushmeat than other nationalities, while of the two dominant Equatoguinean tribes, the continental Fang consume more bushmeat than the coastal Ndowe. Our findings indicate that increasing wealth of a growing urban population will greatly increase future demand for all fresh foods, including bushmeat. There is no evidence of a luxury bushmeat market based on rare species, thus controlled demand for bushmeat could be met from common, highly productive species that are relatively robust to exploitation. Improving the supply of under-developed commodities, particularly domestic livestock, could also offset demand for bushmeat. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this article, we offer a research-based theoretical framework for sustainability, describing the proven qualities of a project and the innovations that support its sustained existence over time. We then describe how a US Department of Education Technology Innovation Challenge grantee, working to promote technology integration in a socio-economically disadvantaged region of the state of Texas, succeeded in creating a sustainable set of activities around its work to support educators' uses of technology. We examine the factors that served to nurture and facilitate sustainability of the practices associated with technology integration to promote student achievement. We take the fact that it is not the project but rather the change in practice that is important.

AB This paper deals with improvement on environmental significant activities related to the life supporting function "building and housing", using life cycle assessment. In the calculation, back-casting technique is utilised and implies to a future scenario, based on known technology. Besides heating, wastewater treatment is a significant issue, according to the definition of building and housing function practised. The main conclusions from the assessment are that rebuilding is an environmentally better choice than the construction of a new building, if the same essential environmentally related functional performance is achieved. Furthermore, the case study and the national estimates performed prove that the potential environmental impact can be reduced by about 70% for the heating service and 75% for the wastewater system, if the suggested measures are performed.

AB I argue that free-market capitalist economies are biased against inventing/using green technology and against supplying the basic needs of the poor. With no mechanism for setting globally optimal prices for non-renewables, entrepreneurs choose labour-saving resource-intensive production methods. Further pressure on labour costs comes from finite individual lifetimes combined with rising access to goods. R&D creates technologies/products geared to saving worker and consumer time, instead of conserving non-renewable resources. Demand for positional luxury goods by the rich crowds out the basic needs of the poor. Technology caters for the demands of the rich, accentuating inequality, as prices fall/quality rises with innovation. I conclude with policies to redress imbalances.

AB The Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) examined the demand for cardiovascular care, the supply of specialist physicians to provide that care and physician survey data on human resource issues, including workload, wait times, satisfaction and future intentions. The CCS used data from the National Physician Survey 2004, the CCS Cardiovascular Specialist Physician Workforce Survey 2001, the Canadian Medical Association's Physician Resource Evaluation Template and procedural volumes from the Canadian Institute for Health Information to analyze key human resource planning issues for cardiologists and cardiac surgeons. There are indications in the 2004 survey data that the average workload continues to be very heavy, with an average workweek of between 55 h (cardiologists) and 64 h (cardiac surgeons), and an additional on-call responsibility of between 106 h (cardiologists) and 196 h (cardiac surgeons) per month, of which 38 h (cardiologists) to 45 h (cardiac surgeons) are spent with patients. As a result, many patients are waiting too long for nonurgent referrals. In addition to the toll that this heavy workload exacts from the current workforce and the long wait times for nonurgent referrals, the workload may also compromise the profession's ability to attract physicians into cardiovascular care. Medical graduates, particularly female graduates, tend to consider workload flexibility and predictability when choosing a specialty area. Supply projections already show a decline in the number of cardiovascular specialists per 100,000 elderly population over the next 15 years. If cardiology and cardiac surgery are perceived by female medical graduates (which now make up over 50% of all graduates) as unattractive areas of specialization, the profession may have difficulty attracting needed new entrants in the future. The CCS Workforce Project Team endorses and supports the 2003 Canadian Medical Association's recommendation for the federal government to establish an independent institute for health human resources to foster and conduct research on the supply, mix, distribution and sustainability of Canada's health workforce. The CCS should also renew its commitment to invest in related activities to improve access to cardiovascular care. The CCS Workforce Project Team also believes that the profession's ability to recruit and retain new medical graduates will depend on how well it addresses the identified quality of work life issues.

AB Sustainable forest management that employs the emulation of natural disturbance paradigm develops plans based on disturbance-driven forest succession. However, most research on forest succession has focused primarily on postdisturbance species change, often ignoring predisturbance legacies. We used the FORECAST ecosystem management model and a newly created natural regeneration submodel to examine the interaction of fire severity, fire frequency, and natural regeneration to produce multicycle dynamics of white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss), lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud.), and trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) in a western Canadian boreal forest. We simulated 19 different scenarios in a factorial disturbance experiment of three severities and six frequencies and a no-disturbance scenario. Our simulations resulted in a wide diversity of boreal forest community types, including trembling aspen dominated mixedwoods with high-frequency (75 year), high-severity (100% mortality) fires, and nearly pure lodgepole pine stands at midfrequency (100-125 year) and high-severity fires. With the unvarying disturbance regimes we used, a variety of different but recurring temporal patterns emerged. We show that the loss of seed source legacies reinforces the disturbance-driven species dominance, demonstrating community inertia. This study provides a long-term perspective to boreal forest management that demonstrates the role of disturbance and legacies in long-term dynamics.

SO CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH-REVUE CANADIENNE DE SANTE PUBLIQUE
LA English
DT Article
AB Virtually all health care operations, including public health, are undertaken only at a local or regional level. Large-scale infectious disease emergencies, such as SARS or pandemic influenza, will be recognized and managed at a local level. the creation of the Publisc Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) was an important step in strengthening public health capacity. However, we need adequate operational capacity in local public health departments to have a strong public health system.
   Local public health takes an integral role in the preparation for and management of infectious disease emergencies. Local public health departments and regional public health infrastructures must be positioned to both maintain core functions and to lead and support health sector response to emergencies. The local establishment of a flexible and sustainable emergency management system must address the need to: integrate health care and first responders; provide all-hazards tools for managing a crisis at the frontline; rank service priorities and provide surge resources; and provide accurate information on a timely basis.
   Only the leaders within the local or regional health care facilities and organizations can develop workable plans to deliver health care. PHAC must ensure and support the local public health infrastructure and local emergency preparedness. Without this support, there will be consequences for local response to major public health emergencies.

AB The response of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. var. latifolia Engelman.) seedlings to three levels of soil compaction and water content was evaluated in raised beds filled with a sandy clay loam soil. In compacted soils, seedling survival, height, root collar diameter and root growth were reduced. Soil water regime was adjusted with irrigation to levels associated with plant moisture stress (near wilting point) and limiting soil aeration (near 0.10 m(3) m(-3) air-filled porosity). Soil water regime affected seedling performance, with higher survival, root collar diameter and root growth observed on treatments with higher water content. Compaction had detrimental effects on growth at all levels of soil water availability. Compaction and water content had strong effects on soil mechanical resistance. Limitations to seedling growth and survival were at least partly explained through their relationships with soil water content and soil mechanical resistance, and combinations of these factors as described by the least limiting water range concept.

AB Background: Positive control materials for clinical diagnostic molecular genetic testing are in critically short supply. High-quality DNA that closely resembles DNA isolated from patient specimens can be obtained from Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed peripheral blood lymphocyte cell lines. Here we report the development of a process to (a) recover residual blood samples with clinically important mutations detected during routine medical care, (b) select samples likely to provide viable lymphocytes for EBV transformation, (c) establish stable cell lines and confirm the reported mutation(s), and (d) validate the cell lines for. use as positive controls in clinical molecular genetic testing applications.
   Methods: A network of 32 genetic testing laboratories was established to obtain anonymous, residual clinical samples for transformation and to validate resulting cell lines for use as positive controls. Three panel meetings with experts in molecular genetic testing were held to evaluate results and formulate a process that could function in the context of current common practices in molecular diagnostic testing.
   Results: Thirteen laboratories submitted a total of 113 residual clinical blood samples with mutations for 14 genetic disorders. Forty-one EBV-transformed cell lines were established. Thirty-five individual point and deletion mutations were shown to be stable after 20 population doublings in culture. Thirty-three cell lines were characterized for specific mutations and validated for use as positive controls in clinical diagnostic applications.
   Conclusions: A process for producing and validating positive control cell lines from residual clinical blood samples has been developed. Sustainable implementation of the process could help alleviate the current shortage of positive control materials. (c) 2005 American Association for Clinical Chemistry.

TI Emergency education: a critical review of the field
SO COMPARATIVE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
AB Emergency education, (that is, education in emergency situations) came to the fore in the 1990s. Defining this new field is not free from contestation. This article describes the trajectory and characteristics of the field and issues arising, focusing on different international discourses as well as contents of teaching and learning, and pedagogy. A key issue addressed is the underpinning concept of development in discussions of emergency education. This article is critical of the narrow focus on economic development and suggests that emergency education needs to address comprehensive development towards quality of life for all. It also suggests that participation is key to sustainable initiatives.

AB This paper describes the computer implementation of the Dynamic North Florida Dairy farm model (DyNoFlo Dairy). The DyNoFlo Dairy is a decision support system that integrates nutrient budgeting, crop, and optimization models created to assess nitrogen (N) leaching from North Florida dairy farm systems and the economic impacts resulting from reducing it under different climatic conditions. The decision support system, based on Excel (R) and Visual Basic (R) software, responds to dairy-specific environmental (climate and soils) and managerial characteristics (livestock management, waste management, crop systems management) and can be used to study the economic and ecologic sustainability of these systems. The DyNoFlo Dairy model is a dynamic adaptation of the framework "balance" of nutrients in dairy farms, commonly used in Florida. The DyNoFlo Dairy model incorporates Markov-chain probabilistic simulation of cow-flows and crop simulation for historical climatic years El Nino southern oscillation (ENSO), automated optimization of managerial options, participatory modeling, and user friendliness. This paper discusses the model components and its computer implementation in a user-friendly application. The model was parameterized for conditions found in North Florida dairy farm systems. It is intended to be a tool for producers, regulatory agencies, and extension services, and because of that, participatory and interdisciplinary work was pursued during model creation, calibration, and validation. A case study for a synthesized North Florida dairy farm using the DyNoFlo Dairy model found substantial differences in the N leaching for different ENSO phases and other managerial factors; and the possibility of decreasing N leaching up to 25% while still maintaining profitability levels.

AB The sources of particles, as well as the geochemical structure and interfacial exchange were studied for the summer benthic nepheloid layer of the shallow (50 m) Gulf of Riga. The material was sampled at nine stations during three cruises of August 2001-2003 with a main focus on the deep waters. Suspended particulate matter (SPM) and its major (N, Si, P, Al, Fe, Mn, Ca) elements were determined as the principal parameters. The results indicate the summer benthic nepheloid layer as an important component of the environmental regime of the Gulf of Riga. The nepheloid layer develops as a result of the near-bottom hydrodynamics and a corresponding saline structure below the thermocline. Benthic resuspension and retention of the settling surface particles in the salinity gradient strongly enhance water turbidity in the depths. The magnitude and sustainability of the nepheloid layer might be also promoted via flocculation of colloidal clay and Mn. Clay-associated Al, Fe and Si are the leading elements of SPM. Manganese is the next major contributor and is governed by its depositional input from the upper layer and cycling in the depths. A regression model indicates adsorption of dissolved silicate onto suspended solids in the silicate-rich nepheloid layer. Particulate organic matter and associated CaCO3 are the dominating biogenic components, which are principally supplied by algae in the trophogenic zone. High sorbed phosphate proportions in the total suspended P agree with the P equivalents of apparent oxygen utilization in the nepheloid layer below the Redfield ratio, indicating phosphate scavenging and deposition with solid particles. These processes control the deep-water P concentration and thus the amounts of P entering the trophogenic layer. The processes operating in the nepheloid layer form a complex mechanism affecting the benthic exchange and hence biogeochemical. cycling in the Gulf. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Grassland agriculture is an important industry for livestock production and land management throughout the world. We review the principles of nutrient cycling in grassland agriculture, discuss examples of grassland farming systems research, and demonstrate the usefulness of whole-farm simulation for integrating economic and environmental components. Comprehensive studies conducted at the Karkendamm experimental farm in northern Germany and the De Marke experimental farm in the Netherlands have quantified nutrient flows and developed innovative strategies to reduce nutrient losses in grassland farming systems. This research has focused on improving the utilization of manure nutrients on the farm by including grain crops in cropping systems with grassland and by incorporating manure handling techniques that reduce nitrogen losses. Although the information generated in experimental farms is not always directly applicable to other climates and soils, it is being transferred to other regions through computer simulation. A whole-farm model calibrated and verified with the experimental farm data is being used to evaluate and refine these strategies for commercial farms in other areas. Simulation of farms in northern Europe illustrate that on the sandy soils of this region, maize (Zea mays L.) silage can be used along with grasslands to increase farm profitability while maintaining or reducing nutrient loss to the environment. Use of cover crops, low emission barns, covered manure storages, and direct injection of manure into soil greatly reduces N losses from these farms, but their use creates a net cost to the producer. By integrating experimental farm data with whole-farm simulation, more sustainable grassland production systems can be cost-effectively evaluated, refined, and transferred to commercial production.

AB Conservation tillage systems can be an important part of a sustainable agricultural system providing benefits for the farmers in terms of labor and fuel consumption; however, yield variability may discourage and slow adoption. Field experiments were conducted for four consecutive growing seasons in northern Greece to investigate the effect of three tillage systems (no-tillage, reduced tillage, and conventional tillage) on corn (Zea mays L.) establishment and silage yield and to compare human labor and fuel consumption required for corn production under these tillage systems in double cropping with winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). The effect of tillage system on wheat grain yield was also evaluated. No significant differences in the emergence of corn plants were found between no-tillage and conventional tillage in two out of the 4 yr of the experimentation; however, in 2 yr, the number of the emerged corn plants was lower by 26 and 16% with no-tillage than with conventional tillage apparently because of dry soil conditions at sowing. In all years, the number of emerged corn plants in reduced tillage did not differ significantly from the other two tillage systems. No significant differences in corn silage yield were found among tillage systems, with the exception of 1 yr where a reduction in corn biomass by 13% was recorded with no-tillage compared with conventional tillage. There were on average 35.9 and 5.6% total time saving and 36.0 and 7.2% total fuel saving with no-tillage and reduced tillage, respectively. Despite significant differences among years, wheat yield was not affected by tillage practices. No-tillage or reduced tillage corn following winter wheat could be successfully implemented under favorable soil conditions at sowing with the advantage of reducing labor and fuel consumption compared with conventional tillage.

   energy efficient; energy efficiency; low energy consumption; sustainable
   solution for drinking water production
AB The ENERCON Desalination Department has developed a new energy recovery system for RO desalination plants, optimized for the combination with wind energy converters.
   The main problem for the combination of desalination processes and wind energy is the fluctuation of power supply generated through renewable energies. Conventional desalination plants (and the belonging energy recovery systems) work at a fixed operation point or in a very small range.
   ENERCON developed a system that can adjust the operation in a range of 12,5-100% energy availability in a very energy efficient way!
   The energy recovery system consists of a low pressure pump (20bar) and three combined pistons (there is no need for a second/booster pump). This "piston type accumulator" is able to transfer the pressure up to 70 bar, needed for the desalination process.
   As a side effect we can also avoid the use of chemicals for the antiscaling and antifouling problem. We managed to avoid additives by a low recovery rate. In the combination with the very efficient energy recovery system we experienced an energy consumption within the RO unit between 2-2,8 kWh/m(3) for sea water and between 0,8-1.3 for brackish water with our prototype plants in the Mediterranean sea.
   The ENERCON design enables a reduction of operation costs through low energy consumption and the avoidance of chemicals. Furthermore it is also a benefit for the environment.
   Our goal: A reliable, sustainable drinking water production of finest water quality!.

ID REMOTE ARID AREAS
AB The effluent streams from MSF and MED plants retain substantial thermal and mechanical energy which is usually wasted as the streams are rejected into the environment. Recent environmental studies pose the question of environmental sustainability of desalination due to the large amount of heat and brine dissipated into the sea. Moreover the use of renewable energy so far have been confined to experimental studies or to the use in remote areas and no studies have been carried out on the coupling of a solar still plant with an existing thermal desalination installation in order to take advantage of the heat streams generated by the thermal plants. The combination of a solar desalination system utilizing the heat reject or the brine from MED or MSF as feed water to the solar plant could mitigate the environmental impact and dramatically increase the efficiency and cost effectiveness of solar plant. This paper presents a number of theoretical solutions to couple a thermal plant and a solar distiller. The possibility of further increasing the 'economical' efficiency of the process by a batch/continuous crystalliser for producing different sea-salts has also been considered.

AB Humidification dehumidification desalination process is viewed as a promising technique for small capacity production plants. The process has several attractive features, which includes operation at low temperature, ability to combine with sustainable energy sources, i.e., solar, geothermal, and requirements of low level of technical features. This paper evaluates the characteristics for several layouts for the humidification dehumidification desalination process. The common feature among these processes is the air humidification tower, where the humidity of the ambient air is increased to saturation at the desired design temperature. The main difference among various layouts is the dehumidification process. The most common scheme is to use a condenser to reduce the humidified air temperature and to condense the fresh water product. Other possible layouts includes vapor compression, desiccant air drying, and membrane air drying. The design equations are developed for the humidification/condenser and the humidification/desiccant systems. Discussion and performance evaluation of various layout shows the need to fully optimize these configurations. This is necessary to obtain the best design and operating conditions that give the minimum product cost.

AB The Viet/American Cervical Cancer Prevention Project embraces a dual mission. We seek to develop sustainable, cost-effective cervical cancer prevention services for women in Vietnam. Because the problem of cervical cancer in Vietnam is in part a legacy of the Second Indochinese War, we also seek to examine obstacles to reconciliation by presenting what most acknowledge to be a remedy in advance of what some will perceive to be an accusation. Certain research and commercial interests have produced obstacles to our dual mission in Vietnam. The Alliance for Cervical Cancer Prevention, supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, has failed to endorse Pap screening for developing countries and is conducting clinical trials which may further disaffect medically underserved groups. Visual screening techniques combined with immediate ablative treatment methods are incompatible with the requirements of "first do no harm." Because the Pap smear will probably be a component of any future human papillomavirus (HPV)-based or visual-based screening programs, it serves the interests of those promoting noncytologic screening methods to also support the development of Pap screening services. Research on HPV screening in developing countries raises concerns of commercial exploitation. Because Pap screening is feasible wherever cervical screening is appropriate, it is inappropriate to delay the development of Pap screening services pending research into HPV vaccines or alternative screening technologies. Quality management is the point at which public health and diagnostic pathology intersect and will remain an indispensable element of cervical screening programs irrespective of the screening test(s) eventually used. Pap screening in developing countries is an ethical imperative without a substantial political constituency and will benefit from the engagement of organized cytology.

AB The diatom assemblages within phototrophic biofilms in secondary treatment tanks of the Fiumicino Airport (Rome, Italy) wastewater treatment plant were investigated. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons were made between assemblages in sedimentation and chlorination tanks, on the tank walls and artificial substrata, on four sampling occasions. The assemblages were characterised by a rather stable species composition, low species diversity and dominance of raphid taxa. Correspondence analysis of diatom relative abundance data with regard to seasonal, site and substratum variation revealed both temporal and spatial differences in species assemblages. Rather than species composition changing over time between different sampling sites and surfaces, the proportional contributions of individual species to the assemblages varied with season. Biovolume data indicated that this outdoor system supported extensive diatom growth (high diatom biomass productivity). The potential use of autochthonous, diatom biofilms in tertiary wastewater treatment (removal of residual nutrients and pollutants) as opposed to conventional physico-chemical technologies is discussed with respect to the protection of receiving water bodies and the development of sustainable waste treatment.

AB This paper presents a brief outline of the theoretical and conceptual fundamentals for the derivation of an ecosystem oriented indicator system to demonstrate the state of ecological entities on a holistic basis. There are two branches of argumentation: on a normative level, the sustainability principle is interpreted from an anthropocentric point-of-view; sustainability in this context means to provide ecosystem services on a broad scale and a long-term basis, including the attempt to avoid unspecific ecological risks. A second line-of-argumentation bases on the principles of ecosystem analysis and the theory of ecological orientation. Consequently, the aspired indicandum is the self-organising capacity of ecosystems, and the indicator sets represents an aggregate of structural and functional ecosystem features in a developing environment. The indicator set is demonstrated by one case study from the Bornhoeved Lakes ecosystem research project. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The population of the endangered plant species Nymphoides peltata in Lake Kasumigaura, Japan, has been declining drastically recently, and seedlings that emerge from the remaining soil seed bank have entirely failed to establish. The decline has followed artificial control of the water level in the lake. To examine the environmental requirements at the seedling establishment stage, we investigated the survival and growth of emerged seedlings at various microsites on the lakeshore by manipulating environmental conditions such as exposure to waves, inundation, and light availability so as to include the conditions of the presumed safe sites. Seedling survival at the early stage was affected most by environmental variables relating to the susceptibility to inundation. Survival until seedling establishment was profoundly affected by light availability as well as by susceptibility to inundation. In all, 136 genets were established in quadrats less prone to inundation and with sufficient light availability, which is consistent with the presumed safe-site characteristics of the original water regime: bare ground exposed during the spring water-level drawdown. Recovering the original water regime with seasonal drawdown will be indispensable for recovering a self-sustainable population. However, as first-aid measures, active restoration efforts through adaptive management using the remnant soil seed bank are urgently needed before the soil seed bank becomes exhausted.

TI Tax exemption for biofuels in Germany: Is bio-ethanol really an option
   for climate policy?
SO ENERGY

CT International Energy Workshop
CY JUN 24-26, 2003
CL Laxenburg, AUSTRIA
AB In 2002 the German Parliament decided to exempt biofuels from the gasoline tax to increase their competitiveness compared to conventional gasoline. The policy to promote biofuels is being justified by their allegedly positive effects on climate, energy, and agricultural policy goals. An increased use of biofuels would contribute to sustainable development by reducing greenhouse-gas emissions and the use of non-renewable resources. The paper takes a closer look at bio-ethanol as a substitute for gasoline. It analyzes the underlying basic German, European, and worldwide conditions that provide the setting for the production and promotion of biofuels. It is shown that the production of bio-ethanol in Germany is not competitive and that imports are likely to increase. Using energy and greenhouse-gas balances we then demonstrate that the promotion and a possible increased use of bio-ethanol to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions are economically inefficient and that there are preferred alternative strategies. In addition, scenarios of the future development of the bio-ethanol market are derived from a model that allows for variations in all decisive variables and reflects the entire production and trade chain of bio-ethanol, from the agricultural production of wheat and sugar beet to the consumption of bio-ethanol in the fuel sector.

AB Hydrogen is becoming the reference fuel for future transportation. However, hydrogen production either directly or indirectly needs to satisfy three criteria: no associated emissions, including CO2; wide availability; and affordability. Water electrolysis is the only available technology today able to meet the first and second criteria. The third criterion includes costs of electrolysis and electricity. The primary requirements for affordable electrolysis are low capital cost and high utilization. Consequently, the electricity supply must enable high utilization as well as being itself low-cost and emissions-free. The only proven, large-scale source of electricity is evolved nuclear technologies, producing electricity at rates competitive with today's CO2-emitting, fossil-fueled technologies. As an example, we show sustainable deployment using cogeneration in a typical competitive power market. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in the building sector to a sustainable level will require tremendous efforts to increase both energy efficiency and the share of renewable energies. Apart from the lowering of energy demand through better insulation and fenestration, small combined heat and power (micro-cogeneration) systems may help improve the situation on the supply side by cutting both the nonrenewable energy demand for residential buildings and peak loads in the electric grid. Though still on the brink of market entry, fuel cells are the focus of interest as the prime technology for such systems. In this study, a methodology for assessing the performance of such systems in terms of primary energy demand and the CO, emissions by transient computer simulations is established, and demonstrated for a natural gas driven solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) and, to a lesser extend, a polymer electrolyte fuel cell (PEFC) home fuel cell cogeneration system. The systems were evaluated for different grid electricity generation mix types and compared to traditional gas boiler systems. The interaction with hot water storage and solar thermal collectors, and the impact of storage size and predictive control was analyzed. Typical heat and electricity demand load profiles for different types of residential buildings and occupancy were considered, and the sizing of the fuel cell system in relation to the heat demand of the building was analyzed. Primary energy savings decline for cases with lower heat demand and for cases with solar thermal systems, and peak for fuel cell systems sized in accordance with the heat demand of the building. Future assessments of fuel cell systems will need a refined methodology, and depend on realistic performance characteristics and models that accurately consider dynamic conditions.

   sustainable construction; environmental impact
AB Sustainability has been enshrined as a goal of society to ensure that the satisfaction of present needs does not compromise the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. It is thus a social objective, achievable only where all areas of society co-operate in fulfilling the associated demands. Ecological sustainability is, in turn, a basic prerequisite for sustainable economic and social development. The first step in formulating an effective response to this challenge, focused solely on the environmental issues, entails a quantification of the contribution required from the various areas of human activity for the achievement of sustainable development. Without binding sub-targets for the different sectors, it will be all but impossible to move systematically towards a sustainable society. These benchmarks for sustainable construction therefore set out to define the requirements to be met by buildings and structures in contributing to the achievement of a sustainable society. The permissible impact of buildings, in terms of energy demand and pollutant loads, during construction, maintenance and operation is determined. The analysis focuses on identifying the permissible levels of loads based on the specific energy consumption per in 2 and year for heating, hot water, electricity and construction. A conscious attempt is made to combine existing methods with the general political consensus by taking account of:
   the ecological scarcity method [G. Brand, A. Scheidegger, O. Schwank, A. Braunschweig, Bewertung in Okobilanzen mit der Methode der okologischen Knappheit (Life cycle analysis using ecological scarcity method), Environmental Publication no. 297, Swiss Agency for the Environment, Forests and Landscape (SAEFL), 1997] used to define critical pollutant loads:
   the limitation of greenhouse gas emissions specified by the intergovernmental panel on climate change (IPCC) [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Climate Change 2001, IPCC Third Assessment Report, www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/]:
   the demands of the 2000 W society [Leichter leben - Ein Verstandnis fur unsere Ressourcen als Schlussel zu einer nachhaltigen Entwicklung - die 2000-Watt-Gesellschaft (Easier living - understanding our resources as the key to sustainable development - they resources. 2000 Watt society), novatlanis, sia, energieschweiz, January 2005] for the conservation of energy
   The study shows that buildings designed to the Passive House standard just about comply with the requirements for sustainable construction, provided electricity generation is based largely on renewable or low-CO2 resources (Swiss power supply mix). The targets are substantially harder to meet where mainly fossil-fuel-generated electricity (European supply mix UCTE) is used. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.v. All rights reserved.

   residential buildings in Switzerland
SO ENERGY AND BUILDINGS

DT Article
DE 2000 W society; energy-saving potential; residential buildings; primary
   energy use; energy perspectives; energy scenarios
AB The 2000 W society, achievable through cuts in resource consumption and per capita CO, emissions, is closely related to the goals of sustainable development. This study identifies the specific targets that need to be met both globally and by Switzerland to realize the vision. As a major energy consumer, the buildings sector will have to make a substantial contribution to meeting these targets. The report starts by examining the energy-saving potential of individual residential buildings through different combinations of building standard and building services system. Various building concepts already available today offer considerable potential and, as individual solutions, often achieve the targets of the 2000 W society. Yet, as the impact of such individual solutions on the building stock is dampened by a range of factors (e.g. long refurbishment cycles, low energy prices, scepticism of investors towards new technology), the effective gains fall far short of the theoretical potential. As the considered implementation scenarios and building stock projections show, the average buildings-sector targets required for the 2000 W society are nonetheless attainable. However, in order to tap the potential in the residential buildings sector, there is an urgent need for immediate action at various levels (e.g. through financial incentive systems, consumer information campaigns).

AB The bulk of rural populations in sub-Saharan Africa have no access to electricity and are under-served by any other form of modern infrastructure. The cost of infrastructure to mainly scattered communities has been perennially cited as largely to blame. This is an undeniable truth, but only part of it. There are in addition, myriads of social, economic and political obstacles that play an unquantified and frequently unrecognized negative role. At the route of the problem lies a subdued role of the would-be recipients who in fact, unlike anybody else, are conversant with their problems. Consequently, a number of products may come as impositions or misplaced priorities. Consumer participation for sustainable development has been articulated at international forums and in publications as being advantageous. In practice however, the concept appears to be generally shunned and even when, occasionally, tried the needs of the consumers are presumed and their roles prescribed. This paper discusses a range of social, economic and political issues that constitute major obstacles to the realisation of sustainable rural development. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

SO ENERGY POLICY

DE Mexico; renewable energy; green power
ID REDUCTION; GASES
AB This paper reviews the prospects for renewable energy as a source of electricity in Mexico. It shows that, in spite of the abundance of renewable energy resources, applications to green power generation are minimal. Opportunities to use renewables as part of the Mexican energy mix are many, and could bring a number of benefits, social, economic, political, environmental and otherwise. Barriers to do so are also many and are analysed here. A pragmatic approach based on six strategic elements is proposed for barrier removal, namely: enabling policy and regulatory frameworks; adequate and effective institutional and technical settings; ad hoc financing mechanisms', concerted action plans among government sectors; mechanisms to facilitate participation of private and social sectors; and effective coordination among national and international stakeholders. It is concluded that Mexico is at crossroads with respect to renewable energy, and that a swift, strong and sustained effort has to be made to alter the present situation. Otherwise, the opportunity ahead will be lost and Mexico will remain a net importer of the new energy technology. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

DT Article
DE innovation systems; renewable energy; innovation policy
AB A better understanding of the systemic processes by which innovation occurs is useful, both conceptually and to inform policy-making in support of innovation in more sustainable technologies. This paper analyses current innovation systems in the UK for a range of new and renewable energy technologies, and generates policy recommendations for improving the effectiveness of these innovation systems. Although incentives are in place in the UK to encourage innovation in these technologies, system failures-or,gaps'-are identified in moving technologies along the innovation chain, preventing their successful commercialisation. Sustained investment will be needed for these technologies to achieve their potential. It is argued that a stable and consistent policy framework is required to help create the conditions for this. In particular, such a framework should be aimed at improving risk/reward ratios for demonstration and pre-commercial stage technologies. This would enhance positive expectations, stimulate learning effects leading to cost reductions, and increase the likelihood of successful commercialisation. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

ID HYDROGEN ECONOMY
AB The dominance of a single-energy system inevitably leads to excessive burden on, and eventually weakening, a particular aspect of the environment, and can cause environmental fatigue and failure (permanent damage) or even catastrophe if dominated for too long; thus it inevitably poses the health and environmental risk. This is the case for our currently fossil-fuel-based energy systems. In fact, each energy system, including renewables and alternative fuels, has its own unique adverse impact on the environment, as dictated by the second law of thermodynamics. A truly sustainable development may be achieved with the diversification and localization of energy sources and systems if the adverse impact of each energy system is sufficiently small and well within the tolerance limit of the environment. Energy diversification and localization would also provide a security for the energy supply and distribution as well for the energy consumers-a specifically important issue in the wake of blackout (electric power failure) in the Northeastern states to the Midwest of the United States and part of Canada on August 14, 2003. The idea of diversified energy systems for the good of humanity and environment is similar to many analogies in other fields, such as bio-diversity is the best means to prevent the spread and damage of diseases and pests, and diversified investment is the best strategy to guarantee the overall best investment return. It is concluded that the diversification and localization of energy systems is the best future energy systems that would be environmentally compatible, and allow for sustainable development as well as energy security for both supply and distribution to the energy consumers.

AB The aim of this work is to study the influence of gas and toxic metal emissions from biomass energy applications such as biomass firing and co-firing on the environmental impact. The main advantage of energy from biomass is the carbon dioxide neutrality of this energy production process provided that sustainable forestry is given. However, biomass combustion produces solid by-products (bottom and fly ashes) that have to be considered. There is a desire to recycle the nutrients from the biomass ash. A major problem of recycling the biomass ash is the high concentration of heavy metals in the ash. Co-firing biomass with coal in traditional coal-fired boilers is becoming increasingly popular as it capitalizes on the large investment and infrastructure associated with the existing fossil-fuel-based power systems while traditional pollutants and net greenhouse gas emissions are decreased. Achieving solution to environmental problems requires long-term policies for sustainable development. In this aspect, renewable energy resources appear to be the one of the most efficient and effective solutions.

AB Although neotraditional architecture largely focuses on promoting sense of community (SOC), it has the potential to influence environmentalism in residents as well. In October 2002, the authors conducted a mail survey of 1,611 middle-class homeowners in Gainesville, Florida, to determine if there were differences in SOC and environmental behaviors, attitudes, and knowledge among homeowners from three development types (traditional, post-World War II, and neotraditional). The neotraditional community reported the strongest SOC among the development types. In terms of environmental behaviors, attitudes, and knowledge, however, the neotraditional community was not more environmentally friendly than were the post-World War II communities and it was considerably less so than was the traditional community. The results suggest that neotraditional design could play a role in influencing homeowners' SOC but that it may not go far enough in terms of promoting the environmental behaviors and awareness needed to form sustainable communities.

AB Because of their specific role in the fate of natural resources of landscapes, riparian lands are considered as landscape management units. Yet, they are part of many farms: In what way does this influence their land use and sustainability? In this article, farm riparian land was defined as the set of riparian fields of a given farm. Our aim was to evaluate farm riparian lands as farm management units and the balance between technical and ecological functions associated with farm riparian land-use types. Technical functions designated the role of land use in elaborating farm production and maintaining farm territory. Ecological functions corresponded to farm riparian land-use intensity and ratio of permanent vegetation. The analysis was carried on 102 farms from 5 study sites representative of dairy agriculture and landscapes in a region straddling Brittany and Normandy (France). Farm riparian land-use types were identified using statistical clustering. Technical and ecological functions associated with land-use types were expressed in the light of agronomy and landscape ecology expertise. Descriptors of farm holdings and farm riparian land were tested as explanatory factors of farm riparian land-use types. The use of farm riparian lands was diverse but well defined; they proved to be farm management units. Compatibilities or antagonisms between technical and ecological functions were underscored according to farm riparian land-use type. We argued that decision support could gain in combining perspectives on riparian lands as landscape management units and farm management units.

ID CONSERVATION
AB The East Usambara Mountains, recognized as one of the 25 most important biodiversity hot spots in the world, have a high degree of species diversity and endemism that is threatened by increasing human pressure on resources. Traditional slash and burn cultivation in the area is no longer sustainable. However, it is possible to maintain land productivity, decrease land degradation, and improve rural people's livelihood by ameliorating cultivation methods. Improved agroforestry seems to be a very convincing and suitable method for buffer zones of conservation areas. Farmers could receive a reasonable net income from their farm with little investment in terms of time, capital, and labor. By increasing the diversity and production of already existing cultivations, the pressure on natural forests can be diminished. The present study shows a significant gap between traditional cultivation methods and improved agroforestry systems in socio-economic terms. Improved agroforestry systems provide approximately double income per capita in comparison to traditional methods. More intensified cash crop cultivation in the highlands of the East Usambara also results in double income compared to that in the lowlands. However, people are sensitive to risks of changing farming practices. Encouraging farmers to apply better land management and practice sustainable cultivation of cash crops in combination with multipurpose trees would be relevant in improving their economic situation in the relatively short term. The markets of most cash crops are already available. Improved agroforestry methods could ameliorate the living conditions of the local population and protect the natural reserves from human disturbance.

AB Land use/cover in Northeast China went through extensive changes during the 1990s. This report explores the interaction between these changes and the environment, and the implication of these changes for rational allocation of water resources. Two reaps of land use/cover produced from 1990 and 2000 Landsat TM satellite images were overlaid in Arclnfo to reveal changes in land cover. Results indicate that farmland and grassland decreased by 386,195 and 140,075. ha, respectively, while water, built-up areas, and woodland increased by 238,596, 194,231, and 192,682 ha, respectively. These changes bore a mutual relationship with the environmental change. On the one hand, climate warming made some of these changes (e.g., conversion of woodland and grassland to farmland) possible. On the other hand, the changed surface cover modified the local climate. These changes, in turn, caused severe environmental degradation and increased flooding. The change between dry field and rice paddy, in particular, raised severe implications for the proper allocation of limited water resources in the Northeast. Efforts are needed to coordinate their rational allocation to reap maximum and sustainable return over the entire area, not just in some localities. Results obtained in this study should be of interest to the international audience of Environmental Management in that they highlight the interactive nature of human activities and the environment and the off-site impact of these activities on the environment.

AB Investigation into local peoples' perceptions can produce useful information that could be incorporated into the decision-making process to help resolve environmental problems. Within the arena of land degradation, a number of studies have also been conducted to explore local peoples' views of the problem. However, the perceptions of land-degrading practices of the general public have so far not been actively solicited. This study aimed to contribute to this area of research by adopting the psychometric scaling technique to empirically explore the lay public's ecological risk perceptions of land-degrading activities in Minqin County in Gansu Province, northern China. The primary data were collected via a questionnaire survey (n = 1,138) administered between 14 and 31 December 2002. The major findings of the survey were: (1) Respondents perceived the ecological risks posed by different land-degrading activities to be different. (2) There was a considerable incongruence in the way in which mining of groundwater was conceived by experts and laymen, respectively. (3) Respondents were pretty unsure of expert knowledge. (4) Respondents' ecological risk perceptions were significantly affected by their personal attributes. As far as the policy implications of these findings are concerned, this study accentuates that we must be aware of, and involved in, the environmental perceptions of the lay public in order to succeed in guiding any human-environment tensions along more sustainable trajectories and navigating the transition to sustainability.

AB One of the primary challenges facing ecotourism management is to establish a profitable and ecologically sustainable industry, while simultaneously achieving a satisfying experience for visitors and raising standards of living in the host community. This paper analyses the management practices and challenges faced by two ecotourism attractions on the Gold Coast and Brisbane in Queensland, Australia, namely Couran Cove Island Resort and Boondall Wetlands Reserve. As an ecotourism-based resort on one of the world's few naturally-occurring sand islands, Couran Cove is active in implementing a range of initiatives for sustainable environmental management. This is particularly important as Couran Cove is home to a wide variety of plant communities and one of the largest remnants of the rare Livistona rainforest on the Gold Coast. The Boondall Wetlands Reserve is internationally recognized as an important feeding and resting habitat for migratory wading birds from Alaska, China, Japan, Mongolia and Siberia.

AB Increased dependence of resource-poor rural communities on soils of low inherent fertility are the major problem of desert agroecosystem. Agrisilviculture practices may help to conserve the soil biota for maintaining essential soil properties and processes in harsh climate. Therefore, the impacts of different land use systems on faunal density, nutrient dynamics and biochemical properties of soil were studied in agrisilviculture system of Indian desert. The selected fields had trees (Zizyphus mauritiana, Prosopis cineraria, Acacia nilotica) and crops (Cuminum cyminum, Brassica nigra, Triticum aestivum) in different combinations. Populations of Acari, Myriapoda, Coleoptera, Collembola, other soil arthropods and total soil fauna showed significant changes with respect to different land use practices and tree species, indicating a strong relation between above and below ground biodiversity. The Coleoptera exhibited greatest association with all agrisilviculture fields. The Z. mauritiana system indicated highest facilitative effects (RTE value) on all groups of soil fauna. Soil temperature, moisture, organic carbon, nitrate- and ammonical-nitrogen, available phosphorus, soil respiration and dehydrogenase activity were greater under tree than that of tree plus cropping system. It showed accumulation of nitrate-nitrogen in tree field and more utilization by crops in cultivated lands. Positive and significant correlation among organic carbon, nitrate- and ammonical-nitrogen, phosphorus, soil respiration and dehydrogenase activity clearly reflects increase in soil nutrients with the increase in microbial and other biotic activity. P. cineraria field was the best pedoecosystem, while C. cyminum was the best winter crop for cultivation in desert agroforestry system for soil biological health and soil sustainability. The increase in organic carbon, soil nutrients and microbial activity is associated with the increase in soil faunal population which reflect role of soil fauna in fertility building. This suggests that strategies may be developed for nurturing fertility-building soil fauna and managing degraded pedoecosystem in desert just by adopting suitable agricultural practices.

DE watershed; sustainable development; environmental management;

AB Long run success in watershed management requires understanding of how economic stratification and social values affect water quality protection. Feedback effects on water quality are produced by three aspects of economic well-being: income levels, quality of life and inequality, including the effects of gender based inequality. In the US emphasis on individualistic values leads to reliance on local and private policy solutions to social problems. Analysis of the context of New York City's internationally famous watershed agreement with communities 120 miles distant provides a case study of these relationships. The nature of economic stratification in these upstate communities and the insufficient response of social policies were an impediment to achieving New York City's water quality goals. As a consequence the City's watershed agreement contains direct economic aid to Watershed communities. The Agreement does not address all stratification issues. Some call for solutions beyond the local level and an approach that benefits from the European emphasis on community. It is in the interest of watershed managers to broaden the scope of their concerns to understand and support state and national programs which address problems created by economic stratification. The expansion of the European Union increases the relevance of these lessons for Europe.

TI A sustainable spending rate without simulation
SO FINANCIAL ANALYSTS JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
ID PROBABILITY; RISK
AB Financial commentators have called for more research on sustainable spending rates for individuals and endowments holding diversified portfolios. We present a forward-looking framework for analyzing spending rates and introduce a simple measure, stochastic present value, that parsimoniously meshes investment risk and return, mortality estimates, and spending rates without resorting to opaque Monte Carlo simulations. Applying it with reasonable estimates of future returns, we find payout ratios should be lower than those many advisors recommend. The proposed method helps analysts advise their clients how much they can consume from their savings, whether they can retire early, and how to allocate their assets.

TI Long-term trends in subsistence fishing patterns and coral reef
   fisheries yield from a remote Fijian island
SO FISHERIES RESEARCH

ID RESOURCES MANAGEMENT; COASTAL FISHERIES; PACIFIC ISLANDS
AB Household and seafood consumption surveys were conducted on the Fijian island of Ono-i-Lau to examine changes in subsistence fishing patterns and the quantity and composition of yield from the fishery, over a 20-year period from 1982 to 2002. It was found that the transition from traditional outrigger canoes to outboard-powered vessels has caused a dramatic increase in catch rate. This has resulted in a reduction in fishing effort, rather than an increase fisheries yield, as the fishery remains governed by subsistence needs and population size. The introduction of fishing technology has had more of a social impact, rendering the traditional shore-based fishing conducted by women less important. This study indicates that the reefs of Ono-i-Lau have sustained a yield of between 2.9 and 3.7 tonnes km(-2) year(-1) of reef-associated fish over the 20-year period. This provides a useful reference point from which to compare other reef fisheries in the region. The findings of this study also support the argument that non-selective harvesting of finfish can minimize the probability of ecosystem shifts. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Are the fisheries in the Tagus estuary sustainable?
SO FISHERIES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
DE fisheries; sustainability; RAPFISH; Tagus estuary
AB The comparative sustainability of seven Tagus estuary fisheries-beam trawl, boat dredge, nets for glass eel, gill nets, eel basket, squid jig and octopus traps - is analysed using RAPFISH. This technique relies upon ordination of scored attributes, grouped in fields that cover ecological, economic, social, technological and ethical sustainability, performed using multi-dimensional scaling. Fisheries were analysed within each discipline and using all the attributes for an interdisciplinary approach. Leverage analysis is used to determine how much each attribute influences the ordination. Concerning the cross-discipline ordination, the studied fisheries lay around the mid-range of sustainability. The most sustainable fishery is octopus traps (57%) followed by squid jig (56%) that has the same results except for technological dimension. Eel basket and gill nets show the next best sustainability scores (55% and 53%, respectively). Glass eel fishery presents a poor sustainability (46%), lying close to the boat dredge and beam trawl, the fisheries with lowest sustainability (44% and 43%, respectively). The low leverage values show that ordinations are truly multivariate and that the results are not dominated by any one attribute. More studies should be conducted on the Tagus estuary fisheries in order to get more information about resources, fishers and their activity, which will contribute to improve sustainability.

TI The food industry from subsistence to sustainability - why Triple Bottom
   Line reporting will become a requirement
SO FOOD AUSTRALIA
LA English
DT Article
AB The management reporting systems employed in the food manufacturing industry provide a window into the Australian food industry's evolution as it responds to community expectations and government requirements. The dominant societal expectations of the 20th century can be viewed as forming resultant eras. The expectations of each era continue to contribute cumulatively to each subsequent era, resulting in increasing complexity and sophistication of society's demands.
   The food industry's management reporting systems have evolved owing to the imposition of society's changing values. This evolution is depicted by a conceptual framework, which portrays the inter-relationship between society, government and industry within each of the proposed eras. These eras are examined and used to explain why the current trend for accountability will continue to strengthen and why triple bottom line reporting will become the norm.

AB A long range of studies are found on forest and forest sector policies although nearly all of them deal with the policy instruments in a descriptive way. Policy instruments are just one necessary element in the framework for efficient policy setting in the forest sector. Very few studies deal with this framework. This study attempts to define a generic framework for policy reform towards sustainable development of the forest sector based on analyses and experiences of policy work in different countries. However, it should be stressed that there is no clear-cut generic framework that exists which is applicable for every country. Any generic framework developed leads to generalizations and invites justifiable criticism. However, analysis of generic frameworks in countries with economies in transition and in developing countries shows that elements of the policy framework are missing and that different elements of the policy frameworks are disconnected, incoherent, and thereby the policies implemented do not lead to the desired outcome.

TI Certification of sustainable forest management practices: a global
   perspective on why countries certify
SO FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS
LA English
DT Article
DE sustainable forestry and certification; institutions; social capital;
   gender
AB In this paper, we examine national conditions that encourage the growth of a private regulatory environmental system to govern forests. Economic, institutional and social capital variables for 117 countries are used to examine factors determining forest certification under the Forest Stewardship Council and domestic competitor schemes. Although economic factors, such as forest exports and GDP, are important in explaining the likelihood that a country's forest management practices are certified, the regression results support the idea that economic institutions and the social context under which firms and forest landowners seek certification matters. The ability of citizens to influence the political process is also significant; in particular, the likelihood that firms and forest owners will seek to certify their forest practices is significantly reduced if women have little or no effective voice in civil society.

ID HABITAT PROTECTION; GOALS
AB In this paper, circumstances where various human activities and interests clash with the conservation of forest biodiversity are examined, with particular focus on the drivers behind the conflicts. After identifying past and current human-related threats potentially leading to conflicts in forests, the paper will focus on conflict management and monitoring, with an emphasis on inclusionary stakeholder networks and a range of approaches towards sustainable land use. Three dimensions of conflicts are examined: substance ('how things are'), procedure ('how things are done'), and relationships ('how people behave'). These relations will relate to three conflict management approaches: (1) technical, which may contribute to reduce or solve the conflict acting on the 'substance' dimension, (2) political, which may influence the 'procedure' dimension of the conflict establishing principles or rules, and (3) cultural, which may affect the 'relationship' dimension of the conflict. Finally, a general model of adaptive conflict management emphasising communication among the parties and a participatory approach that involves monitoring of the conflict resolution outcomes is proposed. The recognition that strong perceptions among stakeholders have the potential to aggravate conflicts is central to the concept of a inclusionary conflict management framework, improved communication between all stakeholders, and better awareness of the context of the conflicts is emphasised.

AB Some analysts expect a complete shift of the global energy system in the 21st century, away from fossil fuels to either renewable sources or new nuclear technologies [L. Schrattenholzer, A roadmap to a sustainable global energy system, in: Proceedings of the International Energy Workshop, Paris, June, 2004]. Fusion might become a corner stone of the future energy system. The construction and successful operation of ITER is a necessary condition to reach this goal. Within the Socio Economic Research on Fusion (SERF) programme guided by EFDA, a consortium between CIEMAT, TU Graz (TUG), ENEA and IPP open to other European energy and fusion research laboratories has been formed to analyse the possible role of fusion in the future energy system. Using TIMES, a single region global model has been constructed including fusion as an energy option. Background of the model is a detailed bottom-up description of the complete energy system starting from mining process up to the various demand sectors. The model dynamics is determined by an optimisation process, in which total surplus is maximized. The paper will present the first attempts to set-up a single region global model and the first results. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DE energy; fusion
AB World energy use is predicted to double in the next 40 years. Currently 80% is provided by burning fossil fuels, but this is not sustainable indefinitely because (i) it is driving climate change, and (ii) fossil fuels will eventually be exhausted (starting with oil). The resulting potential energy crisis requires increased investment in energy research and development (which is currently very small on the scale of the $3 trillion p.a. energy market, and falling). The wide portfolio of energy work that should be supported must include fusion, which is one of the very few options that are capable in principle of supplying a large fraction of need. The case for fusion has been strengthened by recent advances in plasma physics and fusion technology that are reflected in the forthcoming European Fusion Power Plant Conceptual Study, which addresses safety and cost issues. The big questions are How can we deliver fusion power as fast as possible? How long is it likely to take? I argue for a fast track programme, and describe a fast-track model developed at Culham, which is intended to stimulate debate on the way ahead and the resources that are needed.

AB We report on an attempt to distinguish cropped from fallowed land and young from old fallow by the rate of decomposition of a standard material, to contribute towards the development of simple, yet reliable indicators of soil quality and agricultural sustainability on tropical soils. In three southern Cameroonian villages, Senna spectabilis leaves and wood were incubated in undisturbed bush fallow of about 4 years, young secondary regrowth of about 12 years and secondary forest of at least 25 years and in the same fallow age class after clearing and cropping. The decomposition of S. spectabilis leaves distinguished fallowed from cropped land throughout a period of 14 to 280 days after incubation, independent of the fallow type that was cleared and the location. Fallow types were distinguished over the same period, with higher leaf mass loss in secondary forest systems than young regrowth and bush fallow. In all cases mass loss followed significant logarithmic functions. Soil chemical properties were not correlated to leaf mass loss. Mass loss from S. spectabilis wood was not suitable to distinguish either undisturbed from cropped or one fallow age class from another. Significant differences between land uses occurred only at the end of the incubation period. Fallow types could not be distinguished from each other. S. spectabilis leaf decomposition may be developed into one component of a soil quality or soil function indicator if decomposition can be linked to crop yields in cleared sites and biomass accumulation in undisturbed sites and other soil properties.

ID SUBSIDY; POLICY
AB Although farm-worker housing has been neglected in South Africa historically, new policy, tabled in 2004, specifically targets the constraints that have been hampering delivery in rural areas. While either on- or off-faun farm-worker housing is envisioned, constraints with. regard to on farm housing and service provision, such as the prerequisite of security of tenure, prevent generalised delivery to the rural population, despite the fact that ESTA provides for security of tenure under certain conditions. There is a need to upgrade the living conditions of people on farms where they are currently residing, in order to ensure the right to adequate shelter as envisioned by the Constitution. However, under current legislation tenure rights moist first be secured before such action can be taken. Research on an off-farm housing project in Bothaville was conducted in order to determine the sustainability of this approach, while simultaneously assessing the broader housing policy context, with a view to making policy recommendations.

AB The Venice Lagoon (VL) is a complex ecosystem in which public participation and area-based management has often been neglected by administrative bodies involved in the planning of coastal projects and public works. In this area, the analysis of the local situation highlighted a substantial absence of coordination among the various administrative bodies in charge of planning and management at various governmental levels and in different regulated economic sectors. This paper analyses public participation and collaboration with reference to the Integrated Coastal Management context (ICM). The paper examines specific requirements, constraints, and opportunities for the complex case of the VL where participatory management and institutional coordination need enhancement.

AB Water temperature plays a very important role in fish production. The assessment of the impact of water-temperature changes on fish catches in world fishery is essential for the sustainable management of world fishery resources. Fish catch includes different species, but using information analysis, it is shown that total fish catch can be used without significant loss of information about the dynamic properties of the system. A new method for the forecasting of the fish catch of the major fishing areas in the world's oceans under global climate change (temperature) has been developed. This method predicts the tendency (increase or decrease) for fish catch, with quantitative predictor's power, if the temperature is known. This method has been applied to the Indian Ocean to assess the climate-change impact on fish catch. Based on the temperatures predicted using the CLIMate-BiospheRE model for the years 2000-2100, a decrease of fish catch in the Indian Ocean, with the confidence of the predictor's power at >= 90%, has been predicted.

AB Desiccation-tolerance in vegetative tissues of angiosperms has a polyphyletic origin and could be due to 1) appropriation of the seed-specific program of gene expression that protects orthodox seeds against desiccation, and/or 2) a sustainable version of the abiotic stress response. We tested these hypotheses by comparing molecular and physiological data from the development of orthodox seeds, the response of desiccation-sensitive plants to abiotic stress, and the response of desiccation-tolerant plants to extreme water loss. Analysis of publicly-available gene expression data of 35 LEA proteins and 68 anti-oxidant enzymes in the desiccation-sensitive Arabidopsis thaliana identified 13 LEAs and 4 anti-oxidants exclusively expressed in seeds. Two (a LEA6 and 1-cys-peroxiredoxin) are not expressed in vegetative tissues in A. thaliana, but have orthologues that are specifically activated in desiccating leaves of Xerophyta humilis. A comparison of antioxidant enzyme activity in two desiccation-sensitive species of Eragrostis with the desiccation-tolerant E. nindensis showed equivalent responses upon initial dehydration, but activity was retained at low water content in E. nindensis only. We propose that these antioxidants are housekeeping enzymes and that they are protected from damage in the desiccation-tolerant species. Sucrose is considered an important protectant against desiccation in orthodox seeds, and we show that sucrose accumulates in drying leaves of E. nindensis, but not in the desiccation-sensitive Eragrostis species. The activation of "seed-specific" desiccation protection mechanisms (sucrose accumulation and expression of LEA6 and 1-cys-peroxiredoxin genes) in the vegetative tissues of desiccation-tolerant plants points towards acquisition of desiccation tolerance from seeds.

AB This paper explores how an aid-funded Ph.D.-programme in mathematics education instituted in some Southern African Development Community countries measures up to issues related to research capacity development projects. The research capacity development programme is described and reflected against mutual benefit, relevance, sustainability and prioritization of the location of project funding expenditure-some of the constructs in the discourse on research capacity development initiatives. It is found that the benefits of the programme are indeed mutual; the outcomes regarding relevance and sustainability are more uncertain and the location of expenditure of the funding is not overtly in favour of the donor country.

AB The resource-based view and the knowledge-based view are important developments in strategic management theory, and 'knowledge management' has exploded in the Popular management literature. There is, however, little empirical literature that explores the connections between firms' attempts at knowledge management and their HR strategies. In this paper, we focus particularly on links between knowledge management and staffing practices. High-technology manufacturing was selected as the site of our research, its high-technology firms rely oil highly skilled employees to innovate and develop new products and are therefore an ideal environment for exploring the strategies employed for both managing knowledge, and recruiting and retaining employees. Drawing particularly on the work of Hansen et al. (1999), this paper identifies and explores two tits between knowledge management and HR strategy or what we call KM-HR configurations: 'personalization-retention' and 'codification-recruitment'. We argue that there is no one way to manage knowledge and its links to HRM and build a simple framework of potential KM-HR configurations with propositions for future research.

ID LIFE-CYCLE FRAMEWORK; REMEDIATION OPTIONS
AB Goal and Scope. Primary and secondary environmental impacts associated with bioremediation of diesel-contaminated sites were assessed using a retrospective life cycle assessment (LCA) as a function of the duration of treatment and the achievement of regulatory criteria. The case study consisted of the remediation of diesel-contaminated soil using biopiles of 8,000 m(3) of subsurface soil impacted with an average of 6,145 mg of diesel fuel/kg soil over a two-year period.
   Methods. Two scenarios were compared; the construction of a single-use treatment facility oil site or the use of a permanent treatment center that can accept 25,000 m(3) soil/year. Moreover, since bioremediation is never 100% efficient, different efficiency scenarios, including the transportation of partially treated soil to landfill were analyzed. The primary impact of residual soil contamination was determined by developing a specific characterization factor (ecotoxicity and human toxicity categories in the EDIP method) based on the toxic components of diesel. Secondary impacts were assessed with an LCA software.
   Results and Discussion. One major observation was the fact that the soil itself is responsible for an important fraction of the system's total impact, suggesting that it is beneficial to reach the highest level of remediation. The reutilizition of the treatment facility is also an important issue in the overall environmental performance of the system. In the case of a single-use treatment center, the analysis showed that site preparation and site closure were the major contributing stages to the overall impact, mainly due to the asphalt paving and landfilling processes. Results indicated that off-site transport and the biotreatment process did not contribute notably to the level of environmental impact. The use of a permanent treatment center is preferred since it allows a significant decrease of the secondary impact. However, when soil had to be transported for a distance greater than 200 km from the site, global impacts increased significantly.
   Conclusion. Results from this study allowed identifying several process optimizations in order to improve the environmental performance of the biopile technology including: the achievement of low level of residual contaminants, the minimization of asphalt or the use of a permanent treatment center.
   Recommendation and Outlook. LCA was found to be an efficient tool to manage contaminated soil in a sustainable way. However, because of the major contribution of residual soil contamination, additional spatial and temporal data should be collected and integrated in the substance characterization models.

AB This study provides an empirical analysis of the macroeconomic factors that can potentially affect investment decisions in Argentina in a short, medium and long run perspective. Both the theory and the empirical literature are reviewed in order to identify a private investment function for the last three decades (1970-2000). The results suggest that investment decisions seem to be determined, in the short run, by shocks in returns (exchange rate, trade liberalization) and in aggregate demand. Besides, there is evidence of a "crowding-out" effect of public investment. In the long run, the capital accumulation path seems to be closely dependent on both well-developed financial and credit markets and on perspectives of fiscal sustainability.

AB We study the mergers of US publicly traded bank holding companies during 1987-2000 and find that the acquiring firm's sustainable growth rate is an important determinant of the cross-sectional variation in the merged entity's long-term operating and stock performance. The most economically significant determinants of the merged bank's abnormal stock return performance are the acquiring bank's estimated sustainable growth rate prior to the acquisition, as well as post-acquisition changes in this growth rate, and the bank's dividend payout ratio. Our findings are robust even after controlling for several potentially confounding factors.

ID IDENTITY
AB Inspired by the impact of an increase in tourism in the Old Center of Naples, Fondazione Laboratorio Mediterraneo, a nonprofit organization that promotes sustainable town development and encourages participation, has undertaken the participatory action research described in this article. The inhabitants' sense Of community (McMillan & Chavis, 1986) with regard to the distinctiveness of the area (Puddifoot, 1995) and its representation are also explored. The collection of socioenvironmental data (Arcidiacono, 1999), 15 semistructured interviews with key people, and photodialogue (Legewie, 2003) are followed by relational activities carried out together with local inhabitants and group associations in the area. The inductive analysis of the established categories and networks has been carried out with the aid of Atlas.ti. Our findings emphasize that the distinctiveness of the Center and the pride of belonging felt by its inhabitants are expressed ambivalently and negatively, evidence of the inhabitants' lack of a sense of community.

SO JOURNAL OF COMMUNITY PSYCHOLOGY

ID PREVENTION; PROMOTION
AB Increasingly, public health practice is turning to the application of community collaborative models to improve population health status. Despite the growth of these activities, however, evaluations of the national demonstrations have indicated that community health partnerships fail to achieve measurable results and struggle to maintain integrity required for sustaining efforts. Whereas community partnerships are difficult to evaluate, traditional evaluation methods may not be addressing outcomes most relevant to ways partnerships work and may fail to provide information needed by different Partners to make decisions about their continued involvement. This article presents the results of a qualitative case study designed to identify indicators of success for a specific community partnership and to test the feasibility of an evaluation tool more suitable for collaborative efforts. Using Principles of social capital, the research demonstrates that through the discovery and communication of what is valued by participating collaborative members, evaluations can both address internal information needs for sustainability and produce assessments of effects on health outcomes. The "value" indicators generated by the evaluation tool are value presented, as is a description of the process by which they were negotiated. Feedback from the pilot-test participants on the feasibility and value of the process is also presented. By discovering outcome measures that suit both participants and policy makers, community partnerships may move toward greater accountability and hence sustainability. (c) 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Community involvement is an important factor for sustainable highway construction. Information and communication technologies provide a new and more effective approach to facilitate community involvement. However, there are too many parameters with conflicting and subjective definitions related to sustainability and too many stakeholders with varying degrees of interest and sophistication. There is a need for an effective tool to communicate project impacts on sustainability to local communities. This paper presents an ontology for stakeholder management and sustainability in highway construction. An ontology is a conceptual semantic model that attempts to capture human knowledge (both explicit and tacit) in a consistent manner. Ontologies include three main elements: a taxonomy (common vocabulary presented in concept trees), set of relationships (linking concepts across trees), and axioms (limitation/constraints on the behavior of concepts). The ontology was used to develop a portal for broadcasting highway design features to local communities.

ID JUSTICE ANALYSIS; DISCOURSE
AB Sustainable development requires that the goals of economic development, environmental protection and social justice are considered collectively when formulating development strategies. In the context of planning sustainable transport systems, trade-offs between the economy and the environment, and between the economy and social justice have received considerable attention. In contrast, much less attention has been paid to environmental equity, the trade-off between environmental and social justice goals, a significant omission given the growing attention to environmental justice by policy makers in the EU and elsewhere. In many countries, considerable effort has been made to develop clean transport systems by using, for example, technical. economic and planning instruments. However, little effort has been made to understand the distributive and environmental justice implications of these measures. This paper investigates the relationship between urban air quality (as NO2) and social deprivation for the city of Leeds, UK. Through application of a series of linked dynamic models of traffic simulation and assignment, vehicle emission, and pollutant dispersion, the environmental equity implications of a series of urban transport strategies, including road user cordon and distance-based charging, road network development, and emission control are assessed. Results indicate a significant degree of environmental inequity exists in Leeds. Analysis of the transport strategies indicates that this inequity will be reduced through natural fleet renewal, and, perhaps contrary to expectations, road user charging is also capable of promoting environmental equity. The environmental equity response is, however, sensitive to road pricing scheme design. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Antibiotic uptake by plants from soil fertilized with animal manure
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY

ID RESISTANCE; OXYTETRACYCLINE; BACTERIA; RESIDUES; TYLOSIN; CATTLE; CALVES
AB Antibiotics are commonly added to animal feed as supplements to promote growth of food animals. However, absorption of antibiotics in the animal gut is not complete and as a result substantial amounts of antibiotics are excreted in urine and feces that end up in manure. Manure is used worldwide not only as a source of plant nutrients but also as a source of organic matter to improve soil quality especially in organic and sustainable agriculture. Greenhouse studies were conducted to determine whether or not plants grown in manure-applied soil absorb antibiotics present in manure. The test crops were corn (Zea mays L.), green onion (Allium cepa L.), and cabbage (Brassica oleracea L. Capitata group). All three crops absorbed chlortetracycline but not tylosin. The concentrations of chlortetracycline in plant tissues were small (2-17 ng g(-1) fresh weight), but these concentrations increased with increasing amount of antibiotics present in the manure. This study points out the potential human health risks associated with consumption of fresh vegetables grown in soil amended with antibiotic laden manures. The risks may be higher for people who are allergic to antibiotics and there is also the possibility of enhanced antimicrobial resistance as a result of human consumption of these vegetables.

AB Research has shown that alum [Al-2(SO4)(3)center dot 14H(2)O] applications to poultry litter can greatly reduce phosphorus (P) runoff, as well as decrease ammonia (NH3) volatilization. However, the long-term effects of fertilizing with alum-treated litter are unknown. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the long-term effects of normal poultry litter, alum-treated litter, and ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3) On aluminum, (Al) availability in soils, Al uptake by tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.), and tall fescue yields. A long-term study was initiated in April of 1995. There were 13 treatments (unfertilized control, four rates of normal litter, four rates of alum-treated litter, and four rates of NH4NO3) in a randomized block design. All fertilizers were broadcast applied to 52 small plots (3.05 x 1.52 m) cropped to tall fescue annually in the spring. Litter application rates were 2.24, 4.49, 6.73, and 8.98 Mg ha(-1) (1, 2, 3, and 4 tons acre(-1)); NH4NO3 rates were 65, 130, 195, and 260 kg N ha-1 and were based on the amount of N applied with alum-treated litter. Soil pH, exchangeable Al (extracted with potassium chloride), Al uptake by fescue, and fescue yields were monitored periodically over time. Ammonium nitrate applications resulted in reductions in soil pH beginning in Year 3, causing exchangeable Al values to increase from less than 1 mg Al kg(-1) soil in Year 2 to over 100 mg Al kg(-1) soil in Year 7 for many of the NH4NO3 plots. In contrast, normal and alum-treated litter resulted in an increase in soil pH, which decreased exchangeable Al when compared to unfertilized controls. Severe yield reductions were observed with NH4NO3 beginning in Year 6, which were due to high levels of acidity and exchangeable Al. Aluminum uptake by forage and Al runoff from the plots were not affected by treatment. Fescue yields were highest with alumtreated litter (annual average = 7.36 Mg ha(-1)), followed by normal litter (6.93 Mg ha(-1)), NH4NO3 (6.16 Mg ha(-1)), and the control (2.89 Mg ha-1). These data indicate that poultry litter, particularly alum-treated litter, may be a more sustainable fertilizer than NH4NO3.

AB Variation in water resources is a main factor influencing ecohydrological processes and sustainable development in arid regions. Lake level changes are a useful indicator of the variability in water resources. However, observational records of changes in lake levels are usually too short to give an understanding of the long-term variability. In the present study, we investigated the tree rings of shrubs growing on the lakeshore of Lake West-Juyan, the terminus of the Heihe River in western China, and found that Lake West-Juyan had undergone degradation three times over the past 200 years. The lake level decreased from 904.3 to 896.8 m above sea level (a.s.l.) during the period 1800-1900, to 892.0 m a.s.l. from around 1900 to the late 1950s, and the lake dried out in 1963. The trend for changes in lake levels, which was represented by the composite chronology of three beach bars, showed that the phases of increasing lake levels over the past 150 years were during the periods 1852-1871, 1932-1952, 1973-1982, and 1995-1999. Comparison with the history of regional economic development showed that human activity has played an important role in regulating the water resources of the lower reaches of the Heihe watershed over the past 200 years.

ID LAND
AB The Alto Rio Lerma Irrigation District, located in the state of Guanajuato in Mexico, is in agricultural area whose sustainability depends partially upon groundwater withdrawal for crop irrigation. Because of high pumping demands and current land-management practices, groundwater levels have declined severely, resulting in aquifer overdraft. In order to analyze economic, environmental, and water use problems in this region, 12 potential cropping patterns were generated for different groundwater withdrawals using linear programming. Then, simulation of the agricultural system was performed using GLEAMS to estimate the amounts of water, nitrate, and pesticides in both runoff and percolation for each cropping pattern. Pumping costs and an aquifer exploitation coefficient account for the economic and environmental impacts of aquifer overdraft. Finally. the Range of Value Method (multicriteria method) was applied to rank and identify the best cropping pattern. The results show the best alternative for effectively balancing environmental with economic considerations was the farming practice. consisting of land leveling. growing vegetables such as red tomato, and controlled groundwater withdrawals to preserve aquifer sustainability.

   Exchange; first section
AB Recently, corporate social responsibility (CSR) is becoming widely recognized as an issue for Japanese companies. Corporate responsibility for employees is considered important by various stakeholders, and occupational safety and health is regarded as one of these responsibilities. The present authors examined this issue from the viewpoint of corporate management by analysis of statements found in CSR-related reports. For companies listed on the First Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE), we searched for CSR-related reports, and titles and contents, based on two established guidelines: the GRI Sustainability Reporting Guidelines 2002 as the international reference and the Environmental Reporting Guidelines of the Ministry of the Environment, Government of Japan, as the domestic reference. Corporations that published CSR reports were 26.3% (416/1,581) of the total, and large differences were recognized by type of industry. Comparing the numbers of pages for various contents, more concern was shown about the environment than about social activity, indicating the environment to be the main issue of CSR in Japan. In the items included in the guidelines, many matters about occupational accidents were mentioned, but it was found that statements regarding HIV/AIDS, which is not of such strong social concern in Japan, and statements regarding the costs of safety that are difficult to calculate were few. However, statements regarding mental health, which is of high interest socially, were many, even though this issue is not included in the two guidelines used. In revising the guidelines, these matters should be reviewed. In the future, continuance of analysis of CSR-related reports with regard to changes and comparisons with overseas reports will help improve occupational safety and health.

AB While a great deal of scholastic effort has gone into discovering the multifaceted relationships between applied research initiatives and subsequent performance, relatively little empirical research addresses the performance impact from firm investments in basic research initiatives. Even less addresses the interactive roles of both types of research. The authors conceptualize and empirically evaluate the interactive relationship between applied and basic research initiatives and firm performance. Applied and basic research projects are knowledge creation activities in a product development domain, and both initiatives enhance the stored knowledge of a firm. Stored knowledge is the fuel that drives the product development engine. Applied research initiatives assimilate and exploit stored knowledge to develop new products. Basic research initiatives contribute to and enhance the stock of knowledge from which the applied initiatives are drawn. This expanded base of stored knowledge has positive rami. cations for subsequent applied research initiatives. Results indicate that firms that engage in moderate or higher levels of applied research will see enhanced performance returns from additional investments in basic research. Conversely,firms that engage in relatively lower levels of applied research see no performance enhancement at any level of investment in basic research. Firms that rely on a flow of product innovations to provide a continued income stream must certainly invest in applied research initiatives. However, additional investment in directed basic research initiatives will augment future applied projects and could become the source of sustainable competitive advantage.

TI Train-the-trainer as an educational model in public health preparedness

LA English
DT Article
DE preparedness education; public health preparedness; Train-the-trainer
ID PROGRAM; IMPLEMENTATION
AB Train-the-trainer (70 is a widely acknowledged educational model across a number of disciplines, including public health preparedness. However, many questions arise about its proper use, its efficacy, and its optimal role in preparedness education, After careful consideration of the literature and past anecdotal experiences with this educational model, TTT was selected as the preferred and sustainable method for public health preparedness in Maine. Upon completion of Year 1 of the Maine TTT program, our evaluation results revealed that TTT was successful and well received by participants. It is evident that TFT is potentially a valuable tool in public health preparedness, but it should be noted that there is no clear prescription for implementing TFF. Institutions and communities adopting TTT as an educational model must be flexible and willing to revise the training plan as challenges are encountered. Future research is required to help clarify optimal ways of using TTF to promote public health preparedness in the 21st century.

TI Mossbauer and XRD investigation of electrodeposited Fe, Co and Fe-Co
   alloys using a gluconate plating process
SO JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY
LA English
DT Article
AB A fundamental requirement for electrodeposition systems of the 21st century is that the processes involved should be environmentally safe, as well as they should be suited to replace hazardous conventional processes thereby supporting global sustainability. Conventional plating baths contain hazardous components and facilitate the generation of non-desirable compounds. The subject of the present article is the electrodeposition of Fe, Co, and Fe-Co alloys from an electrolyte based on gluconate. Preliminary studies showed that good quality iron-cobalt alloy coatings could be obtained on copper substrates from an environmentally acceptable gluconate plating system. The gluconate bath is inexpensive, non-toxic and easily disposed of. We report the successful deposition of Fe, Co and Fe-Co alloys from a modified gluconate based electrolyte which has not been used previously to deposit these materials. The effect of process parameters, such as current density, pH and deposition time were investigated using the gluconate electrolyte at a temperature of 60 degrees C and a pH of 7. The phase composition, crystal structure and magnetic anisotropy of the obtained alloy deposits are correlated with the applied process parameters. The structural analysis of the deposits is mainly based on (57)Fe CEMS and XRD measurements. alpha-Fe and Co-Fe were identified as dominant phases in Fe and Co/Fe deposits, respectively. The magnetic anisotropy of the Fe-containing deposits was found to correlate with the current density applied during deposition. The time of electrodeposition, at the same time, had little if any effect on the magnetic anisotropy of the obtained deposits. The mechanism and formation of the electrodeposits are discussed on the basis of the obtained results.

AB With depleting oil resources and negative environmental impacts associated with the use of petro fuels, there is a renewed interest in biomass based fuels, which can still form the base for sustainable development in terms of technoeconomics, environmental as well as socio-cultural considerations. As it is a locally available resource, energy equity can also be achieved at global levels and developing countries would stand to gain. However, to exploit the potential of biomass, more work is needed for converting it efficiently into modern energy carriers at competitive prices, supported by relevant policies. Currently, bioethanol and biodiesel have already reached commercial markets, especially as blends with petro fuels. This paper gives an overview on liquid biofuels covering the current and futuristic trends with respect to production and utilization of alcohols, vegetable oil based biodiesel and biocrude, emphasizing on the benefits to rural economy.

AB Cellulosic biomass from agricultural and forestry residues, waste paper and industrial wastes Could be used as an ideal and inexpensive source of sugar for sustainable fermentation into transportation fuel. As such, ethanol-producing microorganisms, mainly Zymomonas mobilis and Saccharomyces cerevisiae are potential candidates for ethanol production. However, the substrates are not cost effective, as the organisms are not able to hydrolyze complex sugars such as lignocellulose. Since last two decades, several microorganisms are manipulated for production of ethanol. Gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca. Z. mobilis, Gram-positive bacteria such as Clostridium cellulolyticum, Lactobacillus casei and several yeast strains have been engineered for bioethanol production from cellulosic substrates. These engineered organisms are able to produce ethanol from a wide spectrum of sugars. This review is focused on the strategies and development of processes for ethanol production by such organisms from lignocellulosic substrates.

AB Non-edible oils like Jatropha, Pongamia, Argemone, Mahua, Castor, Sal etc., can be used for the production of biodiesel. Jatropha curcus has enormous potential for biodiesel production in India. J. curcus is a multipurpose plant with many attributes and considerable potential. It is a tropical plant that can be grown in low to high rainfall areas and can he used to reclaim land, as a hedge and/or as a commercial crop. Thus, growing it could provide employment, improve the environment and enhance the quality of rural life.

AB Landscape processes may impact the amount of carbon (C) required to maintain soil organic C levels. The objective of this study determined the influence of elevation zones on soil organic C maintenance and C-budgets. Research conducted between 1995 and 2003 in a 16o ac (65 ha) east-central South Dakota field measured spatial and temporal biomass [corn (Zea mays) and soybean (Glycine max)] production and changes in soil organic C and C-13 isotopic discrimination (A). Results from this study showed that: 1) data collected through precision farming practices (yield and grid soil samples analyzed for soil organic Q can be used to determine soil organic C maintenance requirements; 2) the corn - soybean rotation may not return enough biomass-C to maintain soil organic C levels at all landscape positions; 3) calculated maintenance rates were dependent on the approach used to estimate below ground biomass; 4) footslope areas had higher maintenance rates than summit/shoulder areas; and 5) 1.84 percent and 1.21 percent soil organic C measure in 1995 (SOC95) were mineralized annually in elevation zones less than 527.3 and greater than 527.3 m, respectively. To maintain soil organic C levels, areas where mineralization is high (footslopes) will require higher biomass-C additions than areas where soil organic C mineralization is low (shoulders). The potential benefits of increasing biomass-C additions to footslope areas at the expense of summit/shoulder areas must be balanced against the potential effects on erosion.

AB Although new technologies such as precision farming will contribute to increasing yields per unit area, similarly soil and water conservation will be instrumental in maintaining these increases in productivity while reducing environmental degradation, off-site transport, and water pollution. Initially, 'precision conservation' was defined as the integration of spatial technologies such as global positioning systems (GPS), remote sensing, and geographic information systems (GIS) and the ability to analyze spatial relationships within and among mapped data. Surface modeling, spatial data mining and map analysis are three broad approaches that can be used to analyze layers of information to help develop and implement management practices that contribute to soil and water conservation in agricultural and natural ecosystems. In this paper, we expand the definition of precision conservation to a developing science that uses the new spatial technologies to link a system from a site specific location, to a field, to a set of fields (farm) to a regional scale. We also expand our discussion based on the status of precision conservation as it was shown by twenty six precision conservation papers presented at the 2004 Soil Science Society of America annual meeting. We propose that precision conservation will be a key science to contribute to the sustainability of our biosphere in this century.

DE wind turbine blade; thermoplastic composites; vacuum infusion
AB This paper addresses the feasibility of using innovative vacuum infused anionic polyamide-6 (PA-6) thermoplastic composites for MW-size wind turbine blades structures. To compare the performance of this fully recyclable material against commonly used less sustainable thermoset blade materials in a baseline structural MW-size blade configuration (box-spar/skins), four different blade composite material options were investigated: Glass/epoxy, carbon/epoxy, glass/PA-6, and carbon/PA-6. Blade characteristics such as weight, costs, and natural frequencies were compared for rotor blades ranging between 32.5 and 75 m in length, designed according to both stress and tip deflection criteria. Results showed that the PA-6 blades have similar weights and natural frequencies when compared to their epoxy counterpart. For glass fiber blades, a 10% reduction in material cost can be expected when using PA-6 rather than epoxy while carbon fiber blades costs were found to be similar. Considering manufacturing, processing temperatures of PA-6 are significantly higher than for epoxy systems; however, the associated cost increase is expected to be compensated for by a reduction in infusion and curing time.

AB Objective: The aim of this research was to study the sustainable effects of a community action program on alcohol service to intoxicated patrons at licensed premises. Method: Since 1996, the hospitality industry and authorities in Stockholm, Sweden, have been cooperating to reduce problems related to alcohol consumption at licensed premises. The intervention has included community mobilization, training in responsible beverage service (RBS) and enforcement. A pretest in 1996 and follow-ups in the 1999 and 2001 designs were used to study licensed premises in Stockholm. Male actors portraying intoxicated patrons visited the licensed premises and attempted to order beer. Observers were present at each visit. At the pretest, 92 licensed premises were visited, 47 in north central Stockholm and 45 in south central Stockholm. In 1999, 103 establishments were visited, 61 in north central Stockholm and 42 in south central Stockholm. At the latest follow-up in 2001, 100 licensed premises were visited, 56 in north central Stockholm and 44 in south central Stockholm. Results: The results from the latest follow-up in 2001 showed a statistically significant improvement over those of earlier measures, with a refusal rate of 70% compared with 47% in 1999 and 5% in 1996. There were improvements in both study areas (i.e., north and south central Stockholm). Conclusions: There has been a significant improvement in the rate of refusal of alcohol service at licensed premises in Stockholm during the project period. The reason for this is probably a combination of the intervention efforts: community mobilization, RBS training and a more efficient monitoring of alcohol service by authorities.

   sustainability of hydrophilicity in the dark
AB In order to investigate sustainability of hydrophilicity in the dark, life of photo inductive wettability generated by ultraviolet ray irradiation for anatase-type titanium dioxide film was obtained. The films were prepared by using cylindrical magnetron gas flow sputtering (CM-GFS) source with pure titanium pipe target. Irradiation by ultraviolet ray tremendously enhanced wettability for short time. When the time decay of wettability was studied, the photo inductive wetting sufficiently kept the high wetting of anatase-type titanium dioxide (TiOx) film. The life of photo inductive wetting was a week. To discuss the change in surface condition, wettability change was applied for the extended Howkes theory analysis. Although the wettability decay was explained by decrease in the hydrogen bond strength, sustainability of hydrophilicity in the dark on the photo inductive wetting was explained by maintaining the increase of dipole interaction effect. Based on the results, difference between photo catalytic reaction and photo inductive effects were discussed for anatase-type titanium dioxide film.

   asphalt; modified asphalt
ID ATMOSPHERIC RESIDUE; DEACTIVATION; SUPPRESSION; PROMOTION
AB A new recycling technology is proposed for separating and recovering aggregate and binder from asphalt pavement waste to develop a sustainable asphalt pavement recycling system. Investigation of the system used water as the solvent, which is the most convenient, economic and safe solvent for humans and the environment. High-temperature and high-pressure water was evaluated for removing the binder from the asphalt mixture and recovering the aggregate. The study found that high-temperature and high-pressure water could remove the binder, particularly in the supercritical region, and that water was effective for removing binder and recovering aggregate from Type II modified asphalt as well as straight asphalt. Further removal of the remaining binder was achieved by repeating the tests in the sub-critical region where adequate effects were not achieved in a single test, suggesting the potential for an iterative approach under low-temperature and low-pressure conditions that would be more suited to commercialization. The present high-temperature and high-pressure water method of separation and reclaiming technology can recover and recycle valuable natural aggregate and oil resources from asphalt pavement waste.

ID WATER MANAGEMENT
AB Western Inner Mongolia is located in the downstream area of the Hei River Basin, the second largest inland basin in China. Since the 1960s, water depletion in the basin has increased very rapidly due to intensive irrigation development in the middle stream area of the Basin. As a result, the downstream Erjina Oasis gradually receded and the destination inland lake disappeared. In the late 1990s, the Chinese government initialized activities for the ecological restoration of the region, including annual flow releases to downstream by administrative order. These releases have contained further degradation of the ecosystem. The challenge that needs to be addressed now is how the short-term administered flow releases can be converted into sustainable water management practices. In particular, research on the determination of environmental flow requirement and livestock carrying capacity will be important for decision making support in the sustainable development of the region.

AB The landscapes that we live in and the changes that they undergo play an important part in the qualities of our lives. They provide natural goods and services of value to us because of the existence of soil, which is a medium between the solid earth and the sphere in which we live our daily life. The medium soil is constantly subject to change and one of the causes is soil erosion. If one tries to understand or to deal with soil erosion it is helpful to consider soil as an integral part of continuously changing landscapes and to be aware of the different functions of a soil in its environmental context at different scales. To clarify this, we present three important concepts. These are: (1) scale/connectivity; (2) change; and (3) resilience. These concepts will be put in an innovative framework called the panarchy theory, which represents a hierarchical structure in which both human and natural systems are linked together in adaptive cycles. Presenting soil erosion in such a framework allows us to link causes and their impacts at different scales. The application of such a framework and the insight obtained could facilitate the assessment of risks and possibilities for sustainable use. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Soil quality evaluation is the process of predicting the capacity of a soil to function. Due to the many possible soil functions, simple measuring of an individual soil parameter is not sufficient. These soil-quality parameters or indicators are grouped in physical, chemical and biological components. Land evaluation, which tries to predict land behaviour for each particular use, is not the same as soil-quality assessment, basically because the biological parameters of the soil are not considered by land evaluation. However, the process of evaluating soil is not new, and agro-ecological land evaluation has much to offer in this sense. A state-of-the-art review of soil quality evaluation and monitoring is presented in this paper, focusing on the possibilities of applying the accumulated knowledge from past studies of land evaluation. An agro-ecological approach is suggested to facilitate the monumental task of relating the nearly infinite list of soil quality indicators to the numerous soil functions, such as an application of MicroLEIS DSS to soil quality.

AB Effective soil-protection policies should be based on a sound understanding of individual land-use decisions in order to change it towards more sustainable decisions. This paper argues for the modification of the behavioural model of 'Homo economicus' by explicitly allowing for cognitive limits and non-reflective modes of behaviour in addition to situational utility-maximizing behaviour. These modifications take into account actual difficulties in changing individual land-use decisions. While it is possible to adjust behaviour by moral persuasion, consensus-oriented round-tables or planning processes, such approaches are unlikely to bring about effective changes in land-use decisions without changing relative prices. This paper suggests ways to implement a special land-use tax as a reform model for existing property taxes. Such a land-use tax applies different rates according to ecological damage. Accordingly, surfaces covered by buildings will pay higher tax rates than free space. Conventional agriculture will pay more than forest areas, and nature reserve areas will be free of charge. Such a land-use tax, designed as a revenue-neutral alternative to Germany's property tax, could trigger modest changes in land-use behaviour in the near future. A general reform of local fiscal relations could increase this effect in the long run. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

ID RISK-FACTORS
AB Recent reform of agricultural policies may lead to adjustments to the inputs of extensive sheep farming systems. Such adjustments may have consequences for animal welfare. These consequences must be understood so that they can be incorporated in the decision-making process. This will help fanners and policy makers meet consumer demands for higher standards of animal welfare. However, identifying and quantifying the different elements of animal welfare in systems of different intensity are difficult. To address this issue, we used adaptive conjoint analysis (a market research technique) to rank alternative management practices for extensive sheep farming systems of Great Britain by their perceived effect on animal welfare. Scores were obtained by asking sheep farmers to compare alternative policies defined by five attributes (labour, housing, veterinary treatment, feeding, and gathering). The financial impact of these policies was assessed. Feeding attribute had the greatest impact on welfare. Labour was also important for welfare but had a detrimental financial impact. Labour management is therefore likely to be critical for sustainable extensive sheep farm systems. It was concluded that welfare could be improved within the context of viable farm business management by careful choice between strategies that fit individual farm circumstances.

TI Stretched to the limit? The impact of local public service agreements on
   service improvement and central-local relations
SO LOCAL GOVERNMENT STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
AB Local Public Service Agreements (LPSAS) are one of a number of policy instruments introduced by New Labour to facilitate service improvement in local government. Situating LPSAs in debates about central-local relationships, this paper examines their impact to date. It compares the expectations of LPSAs amongst central and local stakeholders, delineates the experiences of each in attempting to work in a new way, identifies those aspects of the LPSA process which 'worked' and those which did not, considers evidence of impact and identifies implications for future policy and practice. The paper concludes that LPSAs have led to improvements in the systems and processes of local government, contributed to local partnership working and stimulated limited changes in central-local government relations. Early data indicate that LPSAs have had some impact on service improvement but there remain important questions about sustainability.

AB The precautionary principle has become a reference rule for public actions and policies. Two conceptions coexist under this principle. The first one, based on the strengthening of the concept of environmental protection, aims to promote a prevention proportional to the potential risks. The second one looks for the eradication of risks and it may even require the "proof demand" of innocuousness. The application of the precautionary principle in the fishing sector became established as a reaction in view of the state of resources and the lack of efficacy to guarantee the sustainability of the exploitations. This document tries to stress the application of the precautionary principle in the framework of fisheries. First, it examines the concept of precaution, then it evaluates the concepts applied in the community policy, and thirdly, it concludes by pointing out the problems derived from its implementation.

AB An environmentally benign and sustainable Knoevenagel reaction of aldehyde with ethyl cyanoacetate has been achieved at ambient temperature in water employing 3-aminopropylated silica gel (NAP) as a catalyst. Wide applicability of the reaction is illustrated by the results that not only arylaldehydes of both electronic characters but also aliphatic aldehydes afforded the products. The reaction condition was so mild that aldehydes having acid- or base-sensitive substituents provided substituted alpha-cyano-alpha, beta-unsaturated esters. The catalyst has been efficiently recycled more than five times without any pre-treatment. Catalyst loading was successfully reduced to 0.0029 mmol% (TON = up to 9,226). This protocol was also applicable to the Knoevenagel reaction of malononitrile in good yields in water.

AB Long-lasting alternative splicing of neuronal acetylcholinesterase (AChE) pre-mRNA occurs during neuronal development and following stress, altering synaptic properties. To explore the corresponding molecular events, we sought to identify mRNAs encoding for abundant splicing factors in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) following stress. Here we show elevated levels of the splicing factor SC35 in stressed as compared with naive mice. In cotransfections of COS-1 and HEK293 cells with an AChE minigene allowing 30 splice variations, SC35 facilitated a shift from the primary AChE-S to the stress-induced AChE-R variant, while ASF/SF2 caused the opposite effect. Transfection with chimeric constructs comprising of SC35 and ASF/SF2 RRM/RS domains identified the SC35 RRM as responsible for AChE mRNA's alternative splicing. In poststress PFC neurons, increased SC35 mRNA and protein levels coincided with selective increase in AChE-R mRNA. In the developing mouse embryo, cortical progenitor cells in the ventricular zone displayed transient SC35 elevation concomitant with dominance of AChE-R over AChE-S mRNA. Finally, transgenic mice overexpressing human AChE-R, but not those overexpressing AChE-S, showed significant elevation in neuronal SC35 levels, suggesting a reciprocal reinforcement process. Together, these findings point to an interactive relationship of SC35 with cholinergic signals in the long-lasting consequences of stress on nervous system plasticity and development.

TI Raising awareness of the impacts of climate change: Initial steps in
   shaping policy in Nepal
SO MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Climate change is happening and people have begun to feel its impacts on their daily lives. Clear indications of these impacts can be seen on Himalayan glaciers, which are melting at rapid rates and consequently form massive glacial takes (Figure 1), with a risk of catastrophic glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs). GLOFs result in loss of lives, property, and costly infrastructure, as well as displacement of local people. They represent a particular threat in Nepal, where resources are already scarce. In least developed countries (LDCs) like Nepal, where poverty reduction is a national priority, the impact of climate change appears to be an obstacle to the process of sustainable development. Institutionalizing the climate change issue in national policies has now become an urgent need rather than a choice. As a signatory to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), Nepal has agreed to take climate change considerations into account in its national development agenda. The first step was the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol; the second is building the necessary institutional services such as a Designated National Authority (DNA), which is in the process of establishment. Moreover, climate change policies and strategies, the interconnections between different sectors, and coordination among different line ministries and government departments are issues to be addressed in the near future. WWF has initiated a Climate Witness Project to raise national and international awareness, and supports national efforts to shape adequate institutional responses to climate change.

TI Hydropower and climate change - A reciprocal relation: Institutional
   energy issues in Switzerland
SO MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Since the extremely dry and hot summer of 2003, the question of what effects ongoing climate change will have on hydropower in Switzerland-mainly on the amount of electricity that will be produced, but also on the safety of hydropower plants-has often arisen. Even though predictions of the potential impacts of climate change on hydropower generation are characterized by uncertainty, it can be assumed that within the next 25 to 30 years no significant adaptation of the infrastructure for hydropower generation will be urgently needed in Switzerland. Therefore, there are no major institutional challenges to be faced in this context. On the other hand, extending hydropower generation units to further reduce the emission of greenhouse gases will constitute a challenge to existing institutional arrangements, in Switzerland and elsewhere. In the case of Switzerland, interest in protecting waterways and landscapes will conflict with future efforts to mitigate climate change. Current legislation is based on sectoral considerations and not on a holistic vision of sustainable development. Thus this framework has some shortcomings in terms of constructive negotiation of processes leading towards long-term sustainable development.

AB Since 1999, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has been leading a multinational, multi-agency effort to develop a set of energy indicators useful for measuring progress on sustainable development at the national level. This effort has included the identification of major relevant energy indicators, the development of a framework for implementation and the testing of the applicability of this tool in a number of countries. To achieve these goals, the IAEA has worked closely with other international organizations, leaders in energy and environmental statistics and analysis including the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA), the International Energy Agency (IEA), Eurostat and the European Environment Agency (EEA). Also, the IAEA completed a three-year coordinated research project for the implementation and testing of the original set of indicators in seven countries - Brazil, Cuba, Lithuania, Mexico, the Russian Federation, the Slovak Republic and Thailand. This article provides an overview of the IAEA programme on Indicators for Sustainable Energy Development (ISED) and highlights its experiences and accomplishments.

AB This article summarizes the results of the project on indicators for sustainable energy development (ISED) in Brazil. The project's aim was to present energy related economic, social and environmental data to policy makers in a coherent and consistent form, showing interlinkages, time-series and cross-sectoral analyses and assess energy policy. Two priority areas assessed by these indicators, regarding the country's energy supply and demand, helped in the identification of a number of energy policy options that focused on specific aspects of the country's energy sector. On the supply side, these options include the development and stimulation of renewable energy, such as small-scale hydroelectric, wind, solar photovoltaic power and bagasse cogeneration; stimulation of programmes for ethanol use as automotive fuel and sugarcane bagasse cogeneration; and implementation of natural gas-fired, combined heat and power (CHP) plants. On the demand side, policy options include: the full implementation of the law on efficiency standards for appliances; expansion of utility investment in end-use energy efficiency; adoption of targets and protocols to reduce energy intensity in the industrial sector; improvement of passenger transport efficiency; and the creation of a fund to improve energy affordability for the poor.

DE energy policy; environment; indicators; sustainable energy development
AB This article discusses the development of Cuba's energy sector in the last half century, especially the last 25 years, emphasizing social, economic, environmental and institutional aspects. Energy use is evaluated with the indicators for sustainable energy development (ISED) developed by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and applied by the authors, based on data series from Cuba's National Office of Statistics. Cuba's economy and energy sector have undergone important changes, particularly in the 1990s during the crisis that resulted from the termination of the country's special trade relations with former socialist countries. Based on an analysis of Cuba's economy and energy situation, a number of policies were selected for evaluation, including those aimed to reduce energy import dependence, increase the share of renewable energy sources and improve energy efficiency. The effects of these policies are evaluated in view of sustainable energy development. The article concludes with an evaluation of recent progress towards sustainable energy development in Cuba, and outlines future options for the country.

AB This article presents a summary of a study on the application to the Mexican energy sector of a core set of indicators for sustainable energy development (ISED), developed by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The study focused on the elaboration of socio-economic and environmental indicators related to energy production and use, and was aimed at assessing Mexico's existing energy policies and identifying strategies and possible policies that could bring about improvements in major priority areas: energy intensity, atmospheric emissions, energy import dependency and use of renewables. While positive trends have been observed in relation to energy intensity and atmospheric emissions, Mexico is becoming more dependent on imports of gasoline, natural gas and other high-value secondary energy sources, while exporting significant amounts of primary fuels, such as crude oil. Also, no significant increase has been observed in the use of renewable sources of energy. Social, economic and environmental policies need to be formulated for the energy sector and related investments (public and private) reinforced so that all economic sectors have access to energy from cleaner and more diverse sources.

AB This article presents an assessment of Russia's energy sector, its current state and planned future direction. The analysis of Russia's energy trends is based on a set of indicators for sustainable energy development (ISED), developed under the leadership of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The article discusses Russia's Energy Strategy to 2020, and outlines major developments and challenges of the country's energy system. Russia's energy priorities, captured in the Strategy to 2020, emphasize securing a stable and uninterrupted energy supply; reducing energy intensity and improving energy efficiency; developing the domestic energy resource base; reducing negative environmental impacts; and ensuring affordable energy for the poorer segments of the population. Energy needs and challenges are discussed in relation to the three aspects of sustainability as defined in Agenda 21: economic, social and environmental. Concerns are expressed regarding environmental repercussions of energy development, in particular since Russia's 1998 economic rebound. There are also concerns, despite the economic recovery, that anticipated increases in energy tariffs may exceed the affordability of poorer segments of the population.

DE indicators; sustainable energy; energy efficiency; Thailand
AB This article examines energy priorities for Thailand from the economic, social and environmental perspectives of sustainable development. The article uses a set of indicators devised by the International Atomic Energy Agency in partnership with other international agencies and research institutes in seven countries. Thailand's energy efficiency in the 1980s and 1990s are analysed using energy intensity indicators, and possible impacts on sustainable energy development are highlighted. The early 1990s in particular was an important period for Thailand, as the country was at the height of its economic growth, and a number of energy efficiency and conservation programmes were launched. Energy intensity indicators show continuing and faster growth in energy consumption relative to economic activity. The financial crisis in the late 1990s did halt growth in energy consumption, with positive consequences on environmental emissions, but only temporarily as Thailand's economy quickly started to recover in 2000. Notwithstanding the financial crisis, the other indicators show significant progress in economic and social dimensions.

AB The European Environment Agency (EEA) is the European Union body dedicated to providing sound, independent information on the environment. It is a major information source for those involved in developing, adopting, implementing and evaluating environmental policy in Europe, and also for the general public. In line with its mandate, the EEA has developed - focused around a set of policy relevant questions - a set of indicators to assess progress in Europe in integrating environmental considerations into the energy sector. Each question is answered through one or more indicators describing the development of the sector in Europe, implications for the environment and links to policy actions. The indicators cover not only the current situation, but also trends and prospects and, most importantly, point to the conditions for change that are needed for progress towards a more sustainable energy policy that benefits the environment. The results of the most recent assessment are presented in this article and show that in many areas of environmental integration there have been some successes, but overall progress to date has been insufficient. Substantial additional action will therefore be required in the future if the European Union is going to move towards a more environmentally sustainable energy system.

AB The International Energy Agency (IEA), together with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), UN-DESA, Eurostat and the European Environmental Agency, has recently published a comprehensive joint-agency overview of energy indicators for sustainable development. The IEA's contribution to this publication is based on the IEA energy indicator approach. This approach has been developed and used by the IEA over a number of years. The indicators advocated by the IEA are relatively disaggregated to allow for meaningful analysis of sustainability issues in the energy sector. Using a decomposition approach helps reveal the causal links between human/economic driving forces, energy use and emissions. This article presents examples of IEA's work with indicators and an overview of the methodology used, including an explanation of the link to sustainable development. It also provides an example of a simplified indicator analysis of India, to illustrate the importance of improved data systems in developing indicators that can provide meaningful policy analysis.

AB The European Union's commitment to sustainable development at the 1992 Earth Summit resulted in an EU-wide sustainable development strategy, adopted in Gothenburg in 2001. This article presents an overview of the set of sustainable development indicators (SDIs) recently adopted by the European Commission to monitor, assess and revise the strategy. It provides a critical assessment of the current status of the indicator set, and reviews the main policy trends in the areas of the strategy through a brief analysis of headline indicators, placing energy and climate change issues in a broader perspective. Finally, the article compares the energy SDIs to the recent inter-agency energy indicators for sustainable development (EISD), underlining their similarities as well as their different priorities and objectives. The article concludes that further research is needed to improve the SDI set and further explore the linkages between themes.

AB Many fish populations have variable annual recruitment, which challenges both population model development and conventional management strategies. Here, we develop a stock-yield model to assess the sustainability of the commercial catch of goldeye Hiodon alosoides from western Lake Athabasca of northeastern Alberta, Canada. Goldeyes have highly irregular annual recruitment; many year-classes are poor and dominant year-classes appear an average of only 1.7 times per decade. In the late 1990s, the mean annual commercial catch from this population was about 11,500 goldeyes-primarily fish front the 1982 and 1989 year-classes. A best-fit stock-yield model developed for this population incorporated (1) the restrictions of the catch from a historic fishery that depleted this Population during the 1950s and early 1960s; (2) the restrictions of the known total stock size in the early 1970s, obtained from mark-recapture studies; (3) long-term annual estimates and patterns for stock recruitment (1972-2008); (4) a natural annual mortality rate of 20%; and (5) stock estimates for 1994 obtained from the catchability coefficient (catch per unit effort divided by the magnitude of commercial stock estimated from mark-recapture data for 1972 and 1973). The model Suggested that an annual commercial catch of 10,000 goldeyes was sustainable over all years and conditions (1947-2004). This small modeled catch, about 2% of the long-term mean stock number of 540,000 goldeyes, ensured that at least a few thousand mature.oldeyes would survive to spawn through periods of poor stock recruitment lasting more than a decade. These results suggest that fish populations with irregular annual recruitment can sustain only a low exploitation rate to prevent stock extinction during long periods of low recruitment.

TI Challenges for nursing in the 21st century
SO NURSING ECONOMICS
LA English
DT Article
AB Nursing has and continues to face significant challenges to its identity and sustainability due to prevailing forces of economics and demographics and due to the professional and political response of the profession to date.
   While the 1990's Pew Commission report on nursing missed the mark by predicting an oversupply of nurses, it did call for increasing accessibility and affordability of education, developing integrated education and practice models, strengthening clinical ladders, and increasing the points of entry into the profession.
   Despite this prophecy, nursing education remains hospital-centric when the majority of health care is delivered outside the acute care setting.
   Future educational models should emphasize more sophisticated methods of problem solving and analytical skills rather than attempting to teach an increasingly complex body of knowledge.
   Similarly, care delivery models should emphasize radical redesign instead of incremental layering of tasks that are quickly becoming unmanageable.
   The interdependency of constructs driving nursing education and practice need to be radically redefined, not just retro-fitted, to keep pace with the uniquely different challenges apparent in health care today.

AB Raising and sustaining rice yields in the rainfed lowlands requires an understanding of nutrient inputs and outputs. On sandy lowland rice soils, managing phosphorus ( P) supply is a key factor in achieving increased yields and sustainable production. Phosphorus inputs, rice yields, and crop P uptake were used to quantify P requirements of rice: together with results on soil P fractions, P balance sheets were constructed over five consecutive cropping seasons on a sandy Plinthustalf near Phnom Penh, Cambodia. Grain yields ranged from 665 to 1557 kg ha(-1) with no added P. Average yields increased significantly with P fertiliser application over five consecutive crops by 117, 139 and 140% when the phosphate fertiliser was applied at 8.25, 16.5 and 33 kg P ha(-1), respectively. Without added P fertiliser, a net loss of 1.2 kg P ha(-1) per crop was estimated with straw return and 2.0 kg P ha(-1) per crop with straw removed from the field, whereas, with added P fertiliser, there was a net P gain in the soil of 5.6 or 9.5 kg ha(-1) per crop when straw was removed and returned to the soil, respectively. After one crop, the addition of P fertiliser significantly (P< 0.01) increased recovery in all soil P fractions. Across five successive crops, repeated application of 16.5 and 33 kg P ha(-1) rates resulted in progressive P accumulation in the soil, especially a labile NaOH-Po pool, but had no effect on yields and P uptake of rice. By contrast, 8.25 kg P ha(-1) per rice crop was generally adequate for grain yields of 2.5 - 3.0 t ha(-1) and to maintain soil P pools.

AB Knowledge embedded in a group's structures and processes can be leveraged to create sustainable advantage for organizations. We propose that knowledge embedded with a transactive memory system (TMS) helps groups apply prior learning to new tasks and develop an abstract understanding of a problem domain, leading to sustained performance. We present a framework for understanding TMSs as learning systems that affect group learning and learning transfer, and we test the major outcomes of the framework in an empirical study. We found that groups with a prior TMS and experience with two tasks in the same domain were more likely to develop an abstract understanding of the principles relevant to the task domain-a critical factor for learning transfer in general. We did not, however, find strong support for our contention that a TMS facilitates learning transfer after experience with only a single task. Further examinations of our findings showed that the extent to which members maintained expertise across tasks influenced the degree of learning transfer, especially for groups whose members had previously developed a TMS with another group. Our findings show that a TMS has broader benefits beyond the task for which it first developed because a TMS affects members' ability to apply prior learning and develop a collective, abstract understanding of the task domain. More generally, our study demonstrates that TMSs influence group learning and learning transfer. We discuss our study's implications for practice and for TMS and group learning theories.

AB Demand for organically grown fruit, including sour cherry, is rising in Europe and the United States, but the limited tools for disease management have not been thoroughly investigated. In this study, management of brown rot blossom blight, caused by Monilinia laxa, was examined for organic sour cherry production in Hungary. Combinations of sanitation practices and fungicide treatments, including copper hydroxide, lime sulfur, and micronized and nonmicronized wettable sulfur, were investigated in 2 years and two cultivars. The effect of fungicide treatments on yield and phytotoxicity on spur-leaf clusters was also determined. Among fungicide treatments suitable for organic production, copper hydroxide and lime sulfur alone or in combination with micronized wettable sulfur were most effective for blossom blight control when applied twice (at closed blossom and full bloom) or three times (at closed blossom, full bloom, and petal fall) during bloom. Both treatments were not as effective as the conventional standard and caused more damage on spur-leaf clusters during wet weather conditions, but significantly increased crop yield compared with the untreated control or wettable sulfur treatments. Micronized and nonmicronized sulfur applied up to three times during bloom were equally effective, did not impact yield, were not phytotoxic, and reduced blossom blight compared with the untreated control. Sanitation (the removal of blighted twigs and mummified fruit) reduced blossom blight in both cultivars compared with nonsanitized plots when disease pressure was high. The need for an integrated approach to effectively manage blossom blight in organic sour cherry production is discussed. This is the first in-depth characterization of cultural and chemical brown rot blossom blight control options for organic sour cherry production.

ID EQUATIONS
AB River oases at the southern fringe of the Taklamakan desert in NW China are surrounded by belts of spontaneous vegetation that protect the oases from sand drift. As an important source of forage, fuel and construction wood, this foreland vegetation is also a component part of the agricultural system of the oases but has been, and still is, destroyed through overuse. Within a broader study that aimed to provide a basis for a sustainable management of this foreland vegetation, biomass and production were studied in four vegetation types dominated either by Alhagi sparsifolia, Calligonum caput-medusae, Populus euphratica, or Tamarix ramosissima that were thought to occur under different regimes of natural flooding in the foreland of Qira (Cele) oasis, Xinjiang, NW China. Shoot biomass components were closely correlated to basal area (Calligonum, Populus, Tamarix) or shrub volume and projection area (Alhagi), enabling non-destructive estimation of stand biomass from shoot diameters or shrub dimensions with sufficient precision using allometric regression equations. Relationships between shoot basal area and biomass of the woody species (Calligonum, Populus and Tamarix) agreed with predictions by a theoretical model of plant vascular systems, suggesting that they are determined by hydraulic and mechanical requirements for shoot architecture. Average aboveground biomass densities of typical stands in late summer were 2.97 Mg/ha in Alhagi, 3.6 Mg/ha in a row plantation and 10.9 Mg/ha in homogenous stands of Calligonum, 22-29 Mg/ha in 22 year-old Populus forests and 1.9-3.1 Mg/ha in Tamarix-dominated vegetation. Annual aboveground production including wood and assimilation organs ranged from 2.11 to 11.3 Mg/ha in plantations of Calligonum, 3.17 to 6.12 Mg/ha in Populus, and 1.55 to 1.74 Mg/ha (based on total ground area) or 3.10 to 7.15 Mg/ha (in homogenous stands) in Tamarix. Production of Alhagi is equal to peak biomass. A thinning treatment simulating use by the local population enhanced productivity of Calligonum, Populus and Tamarix. A complete harvest of Alhagi in late August decreased production in the following year. An artificial flood irrigation treatment did not sufficiently increase soil water content except in the uppermost layer and had no clear beneficial effect on growth of the four species and even a negative effect on Alhagi, which was due to increased competition from annual species. As biomass and production with or without artificial irrigation were much higher than values expected for rain-fed desert vegetation at a mean annual precipitation of 35 mm, it is concluded that the existence of all vegetation types studied is probably based on permanent access to groundwater and that natural floods or precipitation do not contribute to their water supply. The effects of agricultural groundwater use in the oasis on groundwater in the foreland of the oasis need further study. Sustainable use of this productive vegetation is possible but requires proper management.

AB Polycrystalline diamond and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) exhibit excellent vacuum field emission properties, characterized by low turn-on voltage and high current density. Their atmospheric field emission and ionization capabilities are reported in this paper. Highly graphitic polycrystalline diamond (HGPD) film was grown in a plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition process, and its ability to ionize atmospheric air was characterized and compared against CNTs. The HGPD sample was activated by applying a moderate voltage bias (340 V) for an extended period across a 10 mu m electrode gap. After activation, a turn-on voltage of 20 V and a sustainable current of 10 mu A were observed with the same gap. Results also indicate that field emission helps to create a moderate ionization effect without catastrophic air breakdown. A hydrogen plasma treatment is shown to restore emission current back to or even exceeding the original level, which suggests an important role of surface termination in the electron emission process. CNTs were grown and tested but did not perform as well under similar conditions.

AB This paper seeks to develop an alternative account of the geographies of environmental governance to those current conceptions which tend to take space and scale for granted as pregiven, contained, natural entities. Through an engagement with the debates on the politics of scale, the argument is made that a new spatial grammar of environmental governance must be sensitive to both the politics of scale and the politics of networks. Rather than considering scalar and non-scalar interpretations of spatiality as necessarily opposite, the paper argues that through a more careful deployment of concepts of hierarchy and territory common ground between scalar and network geographies can be forged, and can inform our understanding of environmental governance. In making this argument, the paper provides an overview of contemporary configurations of global environmental governance, and seeks to illustrate by reference to one transnational municipal network, the Cities for Climate Protection programme, how governing the environment involves both political processes of scaling and resealing the objects and agents of governance, as well as attempts to create new, networked. arenas of governance. The paper concludes that recognition of new spatial grammars is necessary for understanding emerging hybrid forms of environmental governance and their political and ecological implications.

AB The scope of the present paper is to study the perspectives of using lignocellulosic fibrous plant residues as fillers of thermoplastic polymers. Those natural fibres are low-cost by-products, environmental-friendly and practically sustainable raw materials. The lignocellulosic materials used in this study were both untreated and pre-treated residues from eucalyptus wood, ground corncob, and brewery's spent grain. Polymer matrices of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and PVC plastisol were used, to prepare composite specimens with different amounts (10-50 phr) of lignocellulosic fillers. These specimens were tested for their mechanical properties, and additional assessment was made via measurements of their surface hardness and observations by stereoscopic optical microscopy. The results of this study show that loading of LDPE with natural fibres leads to a decrease in tensile strength of the pure polymer. On the other hand, the Young's modulus increases due to the higher stiffness of the fibres. Although the properties of some blends are acceptable for some applications, further improvement will be necessary, mainly by optimising fibre-polymer interface characteristics.

AB Background. British children do not meet daily physical activity recommendations, and as yet no sustainable intervention has been reported to address their sedentary lifestyle. The purpose of this investigation was twofold: First, to examine whether painting playgrounds with multicolored markings would increase the percent of recess time spent in moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and vigorous physical activity (VPA) in girls and boys and second to quantify the contribution recess makes to national recommendations for young people's physical activity.
   Methods. MVPA and vigorous physical activity (VPA) were measured using short wave heart rate telemetry. Physical activity levels were compared before and after playgrounds were painted in 4 intervention schools and compared to 4 matched schools with unmarked playgrounds. Schools were situated in areas of deprivation. Ninety-nine children completed the study.
   Results. A significant interaction (group x time) was evident for MVPA and VPA. Time spent in MVPA and VPA increased significantly in intervention schools as a result of playground painting. Boys were more active than girls, and activity decreased with age, but neither difference reached significance.
   Conclusion. Multicolor playground markings can be a low-cost method of increasing children's daily physical activity levels in the short term. If these increases were sustained, then school playgrounds with multicolor markings would make a valuable contribution to physical activity recommendations for young people. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

AB This paper provides an overview of Britain's continually evolving electricity supply industry and how it got to where it is today. In an ever-changing social, political and technical environment, the industry has gone from private to public ownership and back again, and the benefits of a partial return to distributed generation are now becoming apparent, Continually rising demand and an increased emphasis on sustainability and security are now leading to further restructuring. All of this continues to supply a rich variety of challenges and opportunities for civil engineers, whose role in developing, upgrading and maintaining the nation's power-system infrastructure remains as vital as ever.

CT 32nd Annual Australasian Chemical Engineering Conference (Chemeca 2004)
CY SEP 26-29, 2004

AB This paper is about sustainability in water management from a business perspective. The idea of sustainability has evolved over the centuries. It emerged after the era of super abundance, through the needs of humans in community, to the protection mer, in response to third party scrutiny of resource mismanagement. However, the idea of sustainability has also been embraced, and put into practical effect, through the passion and vision of some business leaders. Richard Pratt has built an entire global business on the foundation of sustainability-through recycling and closed-loop principles. Richard Pratt's vision for sustainability in Australia's water management has spawned Pratt Water, which is shortly to report on an intensive study into business investments to save and sustain water resources in the Murrumbidgee Valley in NSW, Australia.
   The Murrumbidgee River carries 4400 gigalitres (GL) of water each year for 1700 km between Canberra and Balranald. About half this is diverted for irrigated agricultural production purposes. The Murrumbidgee Valley Water Efficiency Feasibility Project seeks to answer key water efficiency questions that will drive new investment, save water and enhance the prospects for regional communities. The current Murrumbidgee Valley's water supply businesses revealed that they cannot support the new investments required to allow them to operate at best practice in terms of water efficiency. The water business balance sheet shows that water is being lost from the River Valley system, and no-one confidently knows where it is going, or at what opportunity cost it is being lost.
   Pratt Water has found that, Valley-wide, about 70 GL are lost to evaporation from the open water, and a further 170 GL, or around 8% of allocations, are lost on or near farms each year. Much larger volumes (over 500GL/year) are simply unaccounted for. Problems with measurement and monitoring of river and offtake flows contribute to water supply uncertainty. Measurement variances of up to 33% mean that no-one can confidently 'sign off' on the water business accounts.
   Pratt Water undertook a detailed economic ranking to establish the costs and benefits of fixing the leaks or otherwise capturing the system's water losses and putting them to new productive use. Using the saved water on higher values crops, and/or including saving costs as part of the overall water supply charges are two ways of achieving better water use for the entire community's benefit.
   The Pratt Water Murrumbidgee project identified additional or new market-based production opportunities within the valley to both generate water savings through best practice (compared to existing activities) and to utilize water saved through other interventions. On this analysis, valley-wide farm gate income could rise by over $100 m/year, which represents about a 20% increase on current economic output. Pratt Water also identified and trialled ways of dramatically lowering the cost of irrigation water delivery, while at the same time improving water use efficiency. This included a new woven, plastic-coated flume pipe which cost 72% less than conventional delivery infrastructure and saved 30-40% of the irrigation water.
   Better management of high summer river flows was also addressed. Solutions included above-ground and below-ground water storages. An aquifer storage and recovery scheme was identified which could provide additional water for as little as $62/ML, whilst providing a means of managing the excessive drawdown in the lower valley's groundwater profile. The team also characterized the ecological assets of the valley and identified ways of supplying the right water at the right time and in an economically feasible way to sustain those environmental resources.
   As the present drought has starkly underlined, water delivery choices, in terms of quality, quantity and timing, are also becoming critical issues for the entire community. While demand for water grows in a supply-constrained system, water users are demanding cost competitiveness in the supply and delivery of that water in the face of increased market competition for the goods they are producing. Pratt Water is showing the needed leadership for the private sector to provide business-led solutions to tackle this crucial water sustainability challenge.

AB The increasing focus on sustainable industrial processes for the chemical industry has resulted recently in a number of new bio-based initiatives. Environmental pressures and a shift towards the use of agricultural-based raw materials, as well as rapid developments in the science supporting biotechnology, have stimulated this interest. The recent sequencing of the human genome and the associated sequencing of industrial bacterial and yeast genomes have also played their part. In addition, the fields of metabolic engineering, bioinformatics and computer-based modelling and process optimization are opening up opportunities for new products and cost reductions. In the present review, a number of these new industrial bio-based processes are identified. A case study on fuel ethanol, using agricultural residues and based on a genetically-engineered micro-organism (rec Zymomonas mobilis), is presented as such a process provides an opportunity for reducing fuel ethanol production costs as well as facilitating the infrastructure for other higher value bio-based products.

AB A paradigm shift is occurring in the way government and businesses are tackling resource management. Up until 10 years ago resource management was viewed simply as a cost saving opportunity and was approached as a technical project usually starting with a resource efficiency audit. Energy was the first to be tackled, due to its relatively high cost, compared with water and solid waste. The approach generally followed a cycle. When energy costs were high an audit was conducted, the easy cost reduction opportunities were implemented and some short-term gains were made. As time moved on however, the focus moved to other business issues, the costs rose again and the cycle continued.
   A fundamental change to resource management is now occurring, with government and businesses driving more sustainable solutions based on a systematic approach to resource management. The systematic approach was first adopted in the energy industry around Australasia and more recently in the water industry. This paper will discuss both the government and industry drivers behind the changes, case studies around Australasia and emerging future solutions to sustainable resource management.

DE energy payback time; high-concentration PV; FLATCON; III-V solar cells
AB The ecological benefit and sustainability of a new energy technology and its potential to reduce CO2 emissions depend strongly on the amount of energy embodied in the materials and production processes. The energy payback time is a measure for the amount of time that a renewable energy system has to operate until the energy involved in its complete life-cycle is regenerated. In this paper, the energy payback time of the high-concentration photovoltaic system FLATCON((R)) using III-V semiconductor multi-junction solar cells has been evaluated. Considering the energy demand for the system manufacturing, including transportation, balance of system and system losses, the energy payback time turns out to be as low as 8-10 months for a FLATCON((R)) concentrator built in Germany and operated in Spain. The energy payback time rises slightly to 12 to 16 months for a system installed in Germany. The main energy demand in the production of such a high-concentration photovoltaic system was found to be the zinced steel for tire tracking unit. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

ID PRINCIPLE
AB This article examines the conflicting imperatives of issues management through a New Zealand case study in which short-term political and economic objectives compete with longer-term ones of sustainability and legitimacy. Issues management becomes double-edged, so that success in achieving one set of objectives may, paradoxically, lead to failure in the other. The article explores this under-researched phenomenon and expands the boundaries of thinking about issues management by recontextualizing it to the marginalized perspective of the planet as a key stakeholder.

AB This article draws on postcolonial theory to critique ongoing neocolonial aspects of public relations theory and practice and especially the field's recent appropriation of terms such as "corporate social responsibility" and "sustainable development." It positions such appropriation as a continuation of the old colonial strategy of reputation management among elite publics at the expense of marginalized publics. The article makes the case that public relations can only begin to be ethical and socially responsible if it acknowledges the diversity of publics, breaks down the hierarchy of publics, and takes into account the resistance of peripheral publics.

AB Globalization challenges organizations to make sustainable connections between enterprise, equity, ethnicity, and the environment. This article contends that to date, the main responses cluster round corporate social responsibility (CSR). It further claims that CSR often results from adverse publicity (and so has been defensive in nature, and reactive rather than proactive); and that its emphasis on corporations marginalizes small to medium enterprises (SMEs), who form a huge part of the world economy. The article illustrates how one SME, Dawnraid Entertainment, from the socio-cultural and geographical edge of Aoteoroa/New Zealand, responds by pioneering community-embedded enterprises.

AB This study was conducted to determine the effect of prescribed fire on surface hydrology in Great Basin pinyon-juniper (Pinus monophylla Torr. & Frem.-Juniperus osteosperma Torr.) woodlands. Infiltration rates were measured using a single ring infiltrometer over an elevation gradient (2 103, 2 225, and 2 347 m) at 3 microsites (tree canopy, shrub canopy, and interspace) and 2 tree cover types (intermediate and high) in August 2001., before a spring prescribed burn conducted in May 2002, and then following the prescribed burn in August 2002. Infiltration experiments were used to calculate saturated hydraulic conductivity (K[theta(s)]) rates, and water drop penetration times were determined to evaluate the development of water-repellent soils. Infiltration rates before the burn were greater at the low elevation than at the mid and high-elevation study sites because of differences in measured soil texture. Before burning, the infiltration and saturated hydraulic conductivity (K[theta(s)]) rates measured on interspace and shrub canopy microsites were less than on tree canopy microsites at the midelevation study site (2 225 m). Following burning, the intermediate tree cover tree canopy microsites had greater infiltration rates than interspace microsites; all other microsites were similar to each other. No significant differences in K(Os) rates existed among the microsites after burning. However, on the higher elevation study site before the burn, the interspace microsites had final infiltration rates less than the tree canopy microsites, and burning caused no deviation from this trend. Saturated hydraulic conductivity rates at the high elevation did not differ by microsite before the burn, but after burning interspace microsites had K(theta(s)) rates less than tree canopy microsites. Burning increased water repellency Of Surface soils (0-3 cm) for all cover types. Spring burning in Pinyon-juniper woodlands may produce a hydrologic response depending on surface soil texture and vegetation cover.

AB Objective: To describe the challenges faced by rural caregivers in providing assistance to older family members with Alzheimer's disease and closely related conditions.
   Procedure: Preliminary focus group findings from a new grant initiative, Alzheimer's Rural Care Healthline, that assesses the efficacy of telephone-based cognitive-behavioral intervention for rural dementia caregivers. Groups identified specific caregiver educational and skills-training requirements and best methods for soliciting referrals from rural health providers, community elder care agencies, and churches.
   Results: Trust emerged as an overarching theme, along with family and community privacy issues and the stigma associated with dementia.
   Conclusions: Future studies should consider the educational priorities, technological requirements, and sociocultural context of rural caregivers in designing telehealth-based interventions, including issues of privacy, stigma, and trust. Recognition of these factors may lead to increased acceptability, frequency of use, and sustainability of rural telehealth programs.

AB This paper uses the concept of policy entrepreneurship to explain the social processes underlying sustainable technical change in the pulp and paper industry in the 1990s. It presents a detailed case study on the differences in the transition to and diffusion of totally chlorine free (TCF) pulp bleaching methods in Sweden and the USA. This change was sustained in the former, while it was almost absent in the latter. The paper studies the causes for this difference. It looks at the complex coevolution of technology, institutions, and consumer preferences that has taken place in both countries and draws conclusions on how transitions to sustainable paths in production and consumption may be supported by economic and social policy.

AB We develop a model of GDP growth under which regime changes are triggered stochastically by an observable tension index, constructed as the geometric sum of deviations of actual GDP growth from a corresponding sustainable rate. Within expansionary regimes, the tension index tends to increase, which heightens the probability of a regime change. Given a regime change, the process becomes reversed, and the tension index begins to decline along a newly established path. Linking the behavior of the tension index to GDP growth enables us to capture floor and ceiling effects.

AB Fishery landings data series from 1970 to 2002 for the Northeast (FAO Area 27) and Northwest Atlantic (Area 21) with 73 and 42 species or species groups respectively, were mapped onto single charts as a diagnostic of the overall state of fisheries in these two regions, and could be appreciated simultaneously for the entire exploited suite of species as a series of contiguous bar charts. Charts were compared with that for a similar data set of 42 species or species groups from the Mediterranean and Black Seas (FAO Area 37). A "traffic light convention" partitioned the range of landings by species over the period into four equal intervals; coloured respectively red, yellow, green and blue between zero and the highest annual landing of the species. This allowed a model-free display of changes in the timing of species' landings at the overall ecosystem level, as represented by the important commercial resources in the three areas. The year T(50) by which 50% of species landings had been harvested over the period, was considered a comparable measure of the response of individual species to exploitation. For a significant proportion of groundfish and pelagic fishes, the time to reach T(50) occurred early in the Atlantic time series. The hypothesis was tested that this measure of the depletion schedule is related to some aspect of species biology, as judged by data from the FISHBASE database. Except for commercial invertebrates where landings peaked late in the Northwest Atlantic time series, no significant regression was found between T(50) values per species and any biological characteristic of the species of finfish tested, suggesting that scheduling may reflect overcapacity and targeting by fisheries and/or regime changes. A decline in peak landings proceeded sequentially over time for the large proportion of all finfish species in the North Atlantic following a broadly similar trajectory. Possible exceptions were deeper water species where fisheries began later, suggesting that "fishing down the bathymetry" has occurred. A more synchronous "pulse" of high landings occurred in the Mediterranean and Black Seas in the mid-late 1980s, which was postulated as due to an increase in system productivity. Although regime changes and quota management cannot be excluded as partly responsible for the persistent low landings late in many time series, the main conclusion is that for all three areas, the effects of fishing overshadow those resulting from differing biological characteristics, habit, or species interactions. Although quota control may in part be responsible for low landings of some species late in the time series, the fishery management regimes that applied during 1970-2002 cannot be considered sustainable. This was confirmed by comparative analysis fitting a variety of models to the raw landing data. Of the mathematical models considered, the Hubbert curve, first used to predict the trajectory of extraction of non-renewable petroleum resources globally over time, best fitted the largest proportion of species time series. This seems to confirm that a hypothesis of harvest sustainability cannot be supported by the landing data.

AB Productivity in subsistence or low-input agriculture depends on the release of nutrients through mineralization of soil organic matter (SOM). For this reason, SOM quantity and quality are two important variables related to the sustainability of subsistence family farming. The objective of this work was to study the interrelationships among soil use, texture and relief, at basin scale, on the concentration of total soil C (Ct) and N (Nt), the oxidizable C fraction with 16.5 mol L-1 KMnO4 (Cox) and the amino-sugars fraction off (Namino). These properties were quantified in 260 single soil samples (0-20 cm layer) from the Vaca Brava basin, Paraiba State, Brazil. The region was sampled using a stratified sampling design with an incomplete factorial arrangement of the strata in areas under subsistence farming. Concentrations of Ct, Nt and Namino decreased in the following order: pasture > fodder > crops. In relation to the relief Ct, Nt and their fractions were greater in lowlands and smaller in foot-hill areas. The latter tended to accumulate sand, while lowlands showed greater accumulation of silt. Sediment redistribution was caused mainly by erosion processes of the back-slope regions, in which finer textures predominated. In relation to textural classes, SOM concentrations and their fractions were greater(p < 0.05) in clayey sand samples and smaller in sandy loam ones. In all strata, Cox and Namino concentrations tended to parallel the variations in Ct and Nt. For this reason, Cox/Ct and Nt/Namino ratios that could be used as SOM quality index varied very little as a function of use, relief or texture.

AB The Integrated Land Use Planning course of the Agronomy School of the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul State, Porto Alegre, Brazil, associates Soil Science with other courses taught in Agronomy, establishing consistent and meaningful crosslinks. The course uses integrated land use planning to feed the compiled agronomical knowledge into a project of sustainable land use for one or more farms. The following sequence of procedures is used for this purpose: regional characterization, survey of existing natural resources, ascertainment of their actual use, production diagnosis, and elaboration of a project for sustainable farm use, which is presented to the local community. Results showed that the course was most useful to train and improve the students' abilities and was supported by students, farmers and organizations engaged in land use planning.

AB Principles of the theory of the ecological mechanism of water self-purification based on multiple functions of the biota in freshwater and marine ecosystems are formulated. In developing this theory, the results of the author's experiments with filtering hydrobionts have been used. These results indicate that the water self-purification mechanism is vulnerable to the impact of some pollutants and, in particular, surfactants. Conclusions drawn on the basis of the theory have practical significance for biodiversity conservation and for the sustainable use of the biological resources of aquatic ecosystems.

AB The World Federation of Haemophilia (WFH) is a global not-for-profit organization devoted to furthering the treatment of hemophilia and related disorders. Founded in Montreal in 1963, it has grown tremendously during the last 40 years and now has 107 National Member Organizations and has been recognized by the World Health Organization. The mission of the WFH is to introduce, improve, and maintain care for patients with hemophilia and related disorders. Several specific programs may be used as tools to achieve these goals. The WFH organizes regular educational workshops on key aspects of hemophilia care. Fellowships are offered to approximately 30 healthcare professionals each year that provide funding for a period of study of up to 8 weeks at an lnternational Hemophilia Training Center of their choice. The WFH twinning program helps emerging hemophilia treatment centers develop partnerships with well-established centers. Although the ultimate goal of the WFH is to promote sustainable hemophilia treatment in developing countries, donations of concentrate are regularly made through the Humanitarian Aid program. The WHF launched the Global Alliance for Progress in its 40th anniversary year, establishing a partnership between the WFH and other stakeholders, including the pharmaceutical industry. The aim is to focus on 30 to 40 developing countries during the next 10 years, aiming to more than double the number of patients diagnosed with hemophilia in those countries. The WFH is also involved in fostering discussion on key issues such as safety and supply of blood products.

AB Happiness and ecological well-being are often portrayed as conflictual pursuits, but they may actually be complementary. In samples of adolescents (Study 1) and adults (Study 2), we tested this proposition and examined the role of three factors in promoting both subjective well-being (SWB) and ecologically responsible behavior (ERB). In both studies, individuals higher in SWB reported more ERB. An intrinsic value orientation (Studies 1 and 2) and dispositional mindfulness (Study 2) related to higher SWB and ERB, while a lifestyle of voluntary simplicity (Study 2) related to higher ERB. Further analyses showed that the compatibility of SWB and ERB was explained by intrinsic values and mindfulness. These findings offer clues to a sustainable way of life that enhances both personal and collective well-being.

AB This study was designed and the field work carried out by a non-governmental organisation (NGO) responsible for implementing hygiene promotion. The sustainability of changed hygiene behaviour was studied at various periods up to nine years after the conclusion of a multifaceted hygiene promotion intervention in Kerala, India. Various methods including a questionnaire to assess knowledge, spot observation, demonstration of skills on request, and household pocket voting were used and compared for the measurement of the hygiene outcome. Pocket voting gave the lowest prevalence of good practice, which we infer to be the more accurate. Good handwashing practice was reported by more than half the adults in intervention areas, but < 10% in a control area. Handwashing prevalence showed no association with the elapsed time since the interventions, indicating that behaviour change had occurred and persisted. Recall of participation in health education classes was significantly associated with good hygiene as indicated by women's handwashing practice (OR 2.04, CI 1.05-3.96) and by several other outcomes, suggesting that the classes were an effective component of the intervention. The evidence for a specific impact on behaviour from home visits and an awareness campaign is less strong, although the home visits had influenced knowledge. The finding of an association between interventions and male handwashing, in ecological analysis (comparing administrative areas i.e. panchayats) but not at individual level, suggests that the effect of the interventions on men may have been indirect, via women or neighbours, underlining the need to direct interventions at men as well as women. The finding that hygiene behaviour persisted for years implies that hygiene promotion is a more cost-effective health intervention than previously supposed. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Growing interest in the potential for soils to provide a sink for atmospheric C has prompted studies of effects of management on the amount and nature of soil organic C (SOC). In this study, we evaluated effects of different grazing management regimes (light grazing [LG], heavy grazing [HG], and non-grazed exclosures [EX]) on amount and composition of SOC at the USDA-ARS High Plains Grasslands Research Station (HPGRS), Cheyenne, WY. Soils (0-5 cm) from each treatment were analyzed for total C and N contents and lignin composition. Soil organic C and N contents were significantly greater in LG (SOC-13.8 Mg ha(-1); total N-1.22 Mg ha(-1)) than HG (SOC-10.9 Mg ha(-1); total N-0.94 Mg ha(-1)) or EX (SOC-10.8 Mg ha(-1); total N4.94 Mg ha(-1)). From CuO oxidation studies, significantly greater (P < 0.05) total lignin (Vanillyl [V] + Syringyl [S] + Cinnamyl [C] compounds) contents were noted in EX (21 g kg(-1) SOC) than LG (12 g kg(-1) SOC) and HG (15 g kg(-1) SOC) soils. The lignin composition of humic (HA) and fulvic (FA) acids indicated that HA under LG contained significantly greater V and S than HG or EX. Fulvic acids contained S-depleted lignin compared with HAs and FAs from HG, which contained significantly greater V and C than FAs extracted from LG and EX. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra of HA and FA, however, did not vary significantly among the three grazing treatments. Results from CuO oxidation and NMR spectroscopy emphasized the familiar problem that determining the nature of soil organic matter (SOM) is a difficult task and sometimes different analytical techniques provide different information about the nature of SOM. Nonetheless, results of this study indicate that LG is the most sustainable grazing management system for northern mixed-grass prairies.

TI Soil resources of the ancient Maya at Piedras Negras, Guatemala
SO SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
ID WETLAND AGRICULTURE; CLIMATE; FOREST; IMPACT; PETEN; MAIZE
AB The ancient Maya thrived for centuries in the Peten rain forest of Guatemala. Their impressive architecture and the evidence of highly populated centers attest that the Maya farmers were capable of producing food surpluses. In the eighth to ninth centuries CE the Classic Maya civilization collapsed. The processes leading to its decline are still debated, but unsustainable agricultural practices and exhaustion of natural resources may have contributed. This paper reports on soil formation rates, soil taxonomy, phytolith analysis, and delta C-13 values of soil organic matter in a rural area near the ancient city of Piedras Negras. Our objective was to understand ancient Maya rural life by linking soil characteristics to ancient agricultural resources and anthropogenic activities. We found that these soils formed at a rate of approximately 0.09 mm yr(-1). All 15 soil profiles belonged to the order Mollisols. The soils of the back-slope locations were shallow (<25 cm) and were probably severely eroded at the time of abandonment (ninth century CE). The soils located at the valley's floor were deep, well developed, and potentially good for sustainable agriculture. Phytolith analysis indicated that in ancient times panacoid grasses were dominant in these soils and provided evidence that the forest was cleared for maize (Zea mays L.) agriculture. Stable C isotopes provided evidence that the vegetation shifted from forest (C,) to C, vegetation during the time of Maya occupation. The toe-slope soils were observed to be less enriched in C-13 in profiles closer to Piedras Negras than in those farther away.

TI Will we see a regional or global duopoly in the satellite manufacturing
   industry? The European perspective
SO SPACE POLICY
LA English
DT Article
AB Consolidation in the aerospace industry in the 1990s has been swift and dramatic as companies strive to gain size and scale in order to better compete both in the global aerospace commercial market and in the regional institutional market. Restructuring has stalled, however, in the satellite manufacturing industry since the turn of the century. And, despite the significant over-capacity that plagues the market and the financial stress endured by satellite manufacturers, the industry has shown remarkable resistance to restructuring and adapting itself to the new market,size and reality. This paper explores whether the current satellite manufacturing industry structure is sustainable, or whether it will evolve towards a global or regional duopoly (one or two satellite manufacturers on each side of the Atlantic), by focusing on the European side of this hypothesis.

ID FRUIT-TREES
AB This article presents the results of field trials of an air-assisted tunnel sprayer with a recycling system for the liquid that is not retained by the leaves. Its characteristics and performance, in terms of distribution quality and losses to the soil, were compared with a conventional air-blast sprayer The trials were done in a vineyard trained to spur-pruned cordon at two growth stages using a fully randomized experimental design. The results show that losses to the ground with the tunnel sprayer were less than 5% of the sprayed liquid in both growth stages, which are much lower than those of conventional sprayers. The amount of liquid retained by the leaves was about 87% of that distributed in both stages. Biological tests carried out during the season showed no significant difference between the sprayers in terms of efficacy. The overall results point out that the tunnel sprayer using this type of air-circulation system requires much less chemical product and shows higher environmental sustainability in comparison with conventional air-blast sprayers.

AB The aim of the System Dynamics Model for Economic Assessment of Sustainability Policies of Transport (ESCOT) is to describe a path towards a sustainable transport system in Germany and to assess its economic impacts. ESCOT was developed within the environmentally sustainable transport ( EST) project of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) that was designed to set up the ecological and technical framework of a transition towards sustainable transportation. ESCOT comprises five models: macroeconomic, transport, regional economic, environmental and policy. The economic assessment for environmentally sustainable scenarios shows that the departure from car- and road freight-oriented transport policy is far from leading to an economic breakdown. By expanding the period for the transition, even more encouraging economic results were derived. For the economic assessment, it is important that ESCOT considers not only first round effects, but also secondary effects. This ability makes ESCOT a powerful instrument for the assessment of such large system transitions.

TI Benchmarking and sustainable transport policy: Learning from the BEST
   network
SO TRANSPORT REVIEWS
LA English
DT Article
ID SYSTEMS
AB Benchmarking is a widely used method of comparing performances and practices in order to learn from the best. In 2000, the so-called 'BEST network' was set up to explore benchmarking as a tool to promote policies for 'sustainable transport'. This paper reports the findings and recommendations from the BEST experience on how to address this challenge. The findings suggest that benchmarking is a valuable tool that may indeed help to move forward the transport policy agenda. However, there are major conditions and limitations. First, it is often not straightforward to measure and compare transport services in order to establish a clear benchmark. Second, 'sustainable transport' evokes a broad range of sometimes conflicting concerns that are hard to address fully at the level of specific organizational practices. Third, policies are not directly comparable across contexts. Attempting to benchmark 'sustainable transport policies' against one another would therefore be a highly complex task, which is not advised. Several other ways in which benchmarking and policy can support one another are identified in the analysis. This leads to a range of recommended initiatives to exploit the benefits of benchmarking for sustainable transport policy while avoiding some of the lurking pitfalls.

ID ANIMAL GENETIC-RESOURCES; PREFERENCES; POLICY
AB A survey of pastoralist and agropastoralist households in south-east Kenya was conducted to determine their production objectives and management strategies in order to optimize and extend a breeding programme for indigenous small East African Shorthorn Zebu cattle. The reasons for keeping cattle and the breed/trait preferences identified reflect the multiple objectives of the livestock keepers, with both adaptive traits and productive/reproductive traits rated as important. Although the Maasai and Kamba zebu (M&KZ) breeds were ranked highly with regard to adaptive traits, the population is considered to have been in decline over recent years. In order to promote the conservation and sustainable use of the M&KZ cattle, the formation of an open nucleus breeding scheme is recommended. In particular, such a scheme would be able to address several existing constraints (e.g. individual herds are very small and communal use of pastures/water makes controlled mating difficult). Such interventions would require the full participation of the livestock keepers, as well as ensuring that a holistic approach to species and breed attributes is taken into account in setting breeding goals, such that the full array of contributions that livestock make to livelihoods and the genetic characteristics related to these contributions are fully incorporated into the programme.

ID URBAN; CITIES
AB Finding an appropriate framework for the integration of humans and "nature" is a subject that has engaged scholars in various disciplines for centuries. Most often, human environments like cities are viewed in striking contrast to the natural world, and this duality has implications for metropolitan planning practice. This paper summarizes the issue of human vs. nature duality as it relates to planning at the urban or metropolitan scale. We find that the problem of human vs. nature duality is embedded and addressed in different realms, each of which is likely to have some impact on the planning profession: environmentalism, ecology, and regionalism and sustainability. We illustrate our argument by reviewing the case of a failed development plan in the western suburbs of Philadelphia. We conclude by offering strategies for the integration of humans and nature in the context of planning.

ID GASOLINE CONSUMPTION; CITIES
AB The results of a recent survey conducted in eight residential areas in the Greater Oslo Region support the hypothesis that there is a connection between land use characteristics and household consumption of energy and transport. Findings from the survey also lend great support to the compact city as a sustainable urban form. However, three distinct findings indicate that decentralised concentration could lead to even lower energy use in households: while the extent of everyday travel decreases in densely populated areas, the central urban areas represent the highest level of leisure-time travel by plane; the access to a private garden limits the extent of leisure travel; and, the difference in energy use for housing between single-family and multifamily housing is reduced in housing built after 1980, indicating that the established conclusions on the most energy-efficient housing should be questioned.

DE collective action; gender; social capital; natural resource management
ID BIODIVERSITY; CONSERVATION; ENVIRONMENT; COMMUNITY
AB This paper seeks to contribute to an improved understanding of the gender aspects of social capital manifested in groups for natural resource management (NRM). We investigated how gender differentiated social groups differ in their activities and outcomes for NRM. A total of 46 men's, mixed, and women's groups were analyzed in 33 rural programs in 20 countries of Latin America, Africa, and Asia. Significant gender differences were found in relation to group maturity and NRM achievements and approaches as well as important differences in experiences of collaboration and capacity to manage conflict. Overall, we found that collaboration, solidarity, and conflict resolution all increase in groups where women are present. In addition, norms of reciprocity are more likely to operate in women's and mixed groups. Similarly, the capacity for self-sustaining collective action increased with women's presence and was significantly higher in the women's groups. The results demonstrate the importance of gender analysis for collective NRM and particularly the role of women for collaboration in and sustainability of NRM groups. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This study examines the recent dynamics in the rapidly growing handmade paper industry in Nepal. The paper argues that the industry is sustainable from social responsibility as well as natural resources and economic perspectives. Five principle sources of socially responsible practices are identified: (1) traditional commitment to community development, (2) fair trade codes of conduct, (3) corporate social responsibility, (4) the industry's business service organization (Nepal Handmade Paper Association), and (5) the general policy and legal framework. The paper concludes with a discussion of this industry as a case study of "positive deviance" and with lessons for contemporary innovation systems theory and for development policy and practice.

AB Reading promotion is necessary and not the least old-fashioned. it has been proven that reading skills are the prerequisite for media competency, without which it is very difficult to participate in our highly technology-oriented society. Reading for comprehension is not only a mandate for schools; libraries are, along with schools, the greatest promoters of reading in our country. No other cultural or educational instituion attracts so many voluntary visitors, and moreover visitors of all age groups and social classes and from so many ethnic and national backgrounds. Hence schools and libraries ought to be cooperating; but till now there has been a lack of continuity and systematic i.e. sustainable, cooperation. One example of successful cooperation is presented here:the Academy for Reading Promotion of the German Reading Foundation based at the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Library/the State Library of Lower Saxony.

AB Linear erosion (LE), including rilling and gullying, has been identified as the major problem for Sustainable agriculture in steepland areas. It causes severe environmental, economic, and social impacts. This issue is even more crucial in those areas undergoing rapid changes in land use, as for example northern Laos, and may dramatically affect soil conservation. Despite an increasing interest in the sloping lands of tropical areas, field evaluations of LE are still infrequent. Furthermore, the controlling environmental factors of topography, land use, climate and soils at the catchment level are seldom analysed. Our main objective was to quantify the spatial and temporal variations of LE at the catchment level and at a yearly basis. The study was conducted in a 0.62 km(2) watershed of Laos (Luang Prabang province) representative of the slash and burn systems of sloping lands. Linear erosion was monitored from 2001 to 2003 within 9 sub-catchments of differing surface areas, topographic characteristics and land use. The length, depth and width of the linear erosion features were recorded every 5-m from their headcuts to their outlets in order to estimate the total catchment LE. 52 linear features, mainly rills, were formed or developed within the study area with a mean erosion rate of 1.3 Mg ha(-1) y(-1). LE rates ranged between 0.1 Mg ha(-1) y(-1) in 2003 to 2.4 Mg ha(-1) y(-1) in 2001. LE features mostly occurred within croplands where erosion rates reached 18 Mg ha(-1) y(-1) In 2001 and 2002 there was a significant correlation between LE and the proportion of the catchment area under crops (r=0.88 and r=0.69, respectively). However this was not the case in 2003 when few rills developed. In 2002 only, LE correlated well with the catchment surface area, the mean slope gradient and the sub-catchment perimeter confirming the non-constancy of LE landscape relation tinder varying rainstorm conditions. A linear regression model for LE prediction at the catchment level, generated from 2001 data, was able to explain 78% of LE variance for the 9 sub-catchments. However, this model was unable to predict accurately LE for 2002 and 2003 (ME> 5 Mg ha(-1) y(-1)). This method for quantifying the linear erosion at the catchment level and some of its controlling factors can also be used for prediction over larger areas since topography and land use data, closely correlated with LE, are easily accessible.

AB Gully incision has been eroding the alluvial sediments and loess soils deposited and developed along the valleys in the and and semiarid regions of Israel. This phenomenon is critical in the and regions of the Negev Highlands where the agricultural fields, the main floral biomass and the areas which have the highest grazing value, are limited to narrow valleys filled with redeposited loessial sediments. The headcut migration and gully development in the region were studied between 1990 and 2001 in three representative drainage basins (Zipporim, Revivim and Sekher). During flood events, the runoff penetrates the alluvial cover of the valleys, forming vertical headcuts, which gradually retreat Lip the valley. The runoff is channeled into narrow gullies, preventing the floodwater front spreading over the whole width of the valley. The change in irrigation efficiency along the valleys is reflected in a sharp estimated drop of 70-90% in the floral biomass, causing the reduction of the range value by 83-99%. During the monitoring time interval (1990-2001), the linear gully retreat in the study area ranged between 12.3 and 250 m an average rate of 1.12-22.7 in year(-1) for each gully head. The process is accompanied by erosion of soil, which has high agricultural and range value. The total soil losses in these sites ranged between 800 and 9000 m(3) at an average rate of 81-818 m(3) year(-1) for cacti gully head, which is equivalent to 121-1227 Mg year-1. During the monitoring period, approximately 0.11-0.87 ha of land lost its agricultural and range value in cacti basin understudy, at an average rate of 0.01-0.079 ha year(-1). Since the Byzantine period (1400 BP), approximately 6.5 ha, which is 10% of the land that had high agricultural and range value in the Zipporim valley, lost its value due to gully erosion. No recovery effects of the gully channels were found in the nearby region. The soil erosion is generated by a long-term natural dynamic change in the soil/rock ratio evolving within the drainage basins through time since the termination of the last glacial phase. The loessic sediments, originally deposited within the drainage basins during the late Pleistocene glacial stage, are being removed under the present Holocene climate in several erosion stages. This ongoing phenomenon is causing degradation of soil and biomass and is severely reducing the agricultural and range potential of the region. These parameters indicate that an ongoing process of desertification is active in the and environment of the Negev Highlands, and is advancing in proportion to the headcut retreat rates in the region. The soil erosion and headcut retreat have been active in the Negev Highlands for the last few millennia. If these processes continue in the future, the Negev Highlands region will lose its agricultural potential within a few millennia. However, the fact that the ancient inhabitants of the region implemented successful long-term land conservation techniques already 3000 years ago, implies that a sustainable land management policy can be adapted to the Negev Highlands, as well as to other semi-arid regions in the Middle East.

AB The isolated Easter Island (Rapa Nui) is an outstanding example of land degradation caused by land use in a sensitive ecosystem. The focus of the investigation was placed on Poike peninsula, the most eastern part of Rapa Nui. While Poike peninsula was once supplied with fertile soils, in large areas desertification takes place today. Detailed analysis of soil profiles allowed the reconstruction of the history and of causes and effects of soil erosion and gullying in the context of land use history and cultural evolution. The results of the stratigraphic analysis prove that from the beginning of human settlement around AD 300/600 until AD 1280 the agriculture on Poike peninsula was characterised by sustainable land use and a traditional type of agro-forestry. Soil erosion was not significant. At around AD 1280 the woodland on Poike, dominated by the endemic palm Jubaea sp., was cleared by slashing and burning. Intensive farming on the upper slopes of the volcanic peninsula resulted in sheet erosion lasting until the 20th century. Settlements and ceremonial places which were built around AD 1300 on downslope areas were buried soon by sediments. Agriculture ceased around AD 1400 on downslope areas as the fertile soils were completely eroded. From AD 1400 until the late 19th century sheet erosion and the accumulation of fine-layered sediments migrated upslope. On average 8.6 Mg of soil per hectare and per year were reworked by erosion (eroded and accumulated within the catchment). Gullying began on Rapa Nui with the sudden increase in the number of sheep during the early 20th century. Gullies are still developing on the island and their ongoing enlargement created extended badlands on Poike which pose a significant problem for ecological and archaeological conservation strategies. Gullying rates exceed 190 Mg ha(-1) y(-1) (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A growing environmental concern is leading the chemical industry to develop environmentally benign products and processes. alpha,beta-Unsaturated carbonyl compounds are important intermediates, however, their synthesis requires several steps and produces toxic wastes. The catalytic behavior of a Mg,Al-mixed oxide, derived from thermal decomposition of a hydrotalcite and an X zeolite exchanged with cesium and impregnated with cesium species was studied using the aldol condensation reaction between glyceraldehyde acetonide and acetone producing the corresponding alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl compound. These catalysts were active for the studied reaction. The product distribution has shown that besides the principle product, other compounds obtained from different aldol reactions were observed. The rehydration of the Mg,Al-mixed oxide generated a catalyst that was selective to the condensation product of glyceraldehyde acetonide and acetone. The decrease of reaction temperature favored the formation of the main product over the Mg,Al-mixed oxide sample. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Measurements of sap flow, meteorological parameters, soil water content and tension were made for 4 months in a young cashew (Anacardium occidentale L.) plantation during the 2002 rainy season in Ejura, Ghana. This experiment was part of a sustainable water management project in West Africa. The Granier system was used to measure half-hourly whole-tree sap flow. Weather variables were observed with an automatic weather station, whereas soil moisture and tension were measured with a Delta-T profile probe and tensiometers respectively. Clearness index (CI), a measure of the sky condition, was significantly correlated with tree transpiration (r(2) = 0.73) and potential evaporation (r(2) = 0.86). Both diurnal and daily stomata conductance were poorly correlated with the climatic variables. Estimated daily canopy conductance g(c) ranged from 4.0 to 21.2 mm s(-1), with a mean value of 8.0 +/- 3.3 mm s(-1). Water flux variation was related to a range of environmental variables: soil water content, air temperature, solar radiation, relative humidity and vapour pressure deficit. Linear and non-linear regression models, as well as a modified Priestley-Taylor formula, were fitted with transpiration, and the well-correlated variables, using half-hourly measurements. Measured and predicted transpiration using these regression models were in good agreement, with r(2) ranging from 0.71 to 0.84. The computed measure of accuracy delta indicated that a non-linear model is better than its corresponding linear one. Furthermore, solar radiation, CI, clouds and rain were found to influence tree water flux. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB The production of hydrogen by steam reforming of bio-oils obtained from the fast pyrolysis of biomass requires the development of efficient catalysts able to cope with the complex chemical nature of the reactant. The present work focuses on the use of noble metal-based catalysts for the steam reforming of a few model compounds and that of an actual bio-oil. The steam reforming of the model compounds was investigated in the temperature range 650-950 degrees C over Pt, Pd and Rh supported on alumina and a ceria-zirconia sample. The model compounds used were acetic acid, phenol, acetone and ethanol. The nature of the support appeared to play a significant role in the activity of these catalysts. The use of ceria-zirconia, a redox mixed oxide, lead to higher H-2 yields as compared to the case of the alumina-supported catalysts. The supported Rh and Pt catalysts were the most active for the steam reforming of these compounds, while Pd-based catalysts poorly performed. The activity of the promising Pt and Rh catalysts was also investigated for the steam reforming of a bio-oil obtained from beech wood fast pyrolysis. Temperatures close to, or higher than, 800 degrees C were required to achieve significant conversions to COx and H-2 (e.g., H-2 yields around 70%). The ceria-zirconia materials showed a higher activity than the corresponding alumina samples. A Pt/ceria-zirconia sample used for over 9 h showed essentially constant activity, while extensive carbonaceous deposits were observed on the quartz reactor walls from early time on stream. In the present case, no benefit was observed by adding a small amount of O-2 to the steam/bio-oil feed (autothermal reforming, ATR), probably partly due to the already high concentration of oxygen in the bio-oil composition.

AB The sustainability of irrigated agriculture in many arid and semiarid areas of the world is at risk because of a combination of several interrelated factors, including lack of fresh water, lack of drainage, the presence of high water tables, and salinization of soil and groundwater resources. Nowhere in the United States are these issues more apparent than in the San Joaquin Valley of California. A solid understanding of salinization processes at regional spatial and decadal time scales is required to evaluate the sustainability of irrigated agriculture. A hydro-salinity model was developed to integrate subsurface hydrology with reactive salt transport for a 1,400-kM(2) study area in the San Joaquin Valley. The model was used to reconstruct historical changes in salt storage by irrigated agriculture over the past 60 years. We show that patterns in soil and groundwater salinity were caused by spatial variations in soil hydrology, the change from local groundwater to snowmelt water as the main irrigation water supply, and by occasional droughts. Gypsum dissolution was a critical component of the regional salt balance. Although results show that the total salt input and output were about equal for the past 20 years, the model also predicts salinization of the deeper aquifers, thereby questioning the sustainability of irrigated agriculture.

AB This study quantifies prescribed fire effects at four sites in southern Ohio, from 1995 to 2002. Each site had three treatment units: an unburned control, a unit burned 2 x (1996 and 1999), and a unit burned 4 x (1996-1999). Vegetation plots were stratified by an integrated moisture index (IMI) into xeric, intermediate, and mesic classes. Prior to treatments, oak (Quercus spp.) and hickory (Carya spp.) comprised 74-83% of basal area among sites but shade-tolerant species (e.g., Acer rubrum) were abundant in the midstory and completely dominated the sapling layer. Fires were conducted in March and April. Fire intensity, estimated by temperature-sensitive paints, was highest on the 2 x burn units. Fires had little effect on large tree ( > 25 cm DBH) density and stand basal area. By contrast, the density of small trees (10-25 cm DBH) was reduced by 31% on 2 x burn units and by 19% on 4 x burn units. "Fire-induced" mortality (i.e., mortality on burn units above that of unburned units) for the most common species of small trees was: A. rubrum = 33%; Quercus alba = 17%; Carya spp. = 13%; Nyssa sylvatica = 10%; Acer saccharum = 4%; Quercus prinus = 2%. Sapling density was reduced by 86% on burn treatments. Despite reduced small tree and sapling densities on burned units, canopy openness, estimated by hemispherical photography, remained low (< 6%). In general, the composition of tree regeneration was not substantially altered by fire treatments. On burn units, a significant initial decrease in A. rubrum seedling density and a significant increase in Liriodendron tulipifera from the seed bank did not persist throughout the study. Oak + hickory seedling density was not significantly affected by fire nor was the density of shade-tolerant seedlings. Post-treatment (2002) sampling of large seedlings (> 30 cm height) indicated no significant differences in the abundance of oak + hickory nor that of shade-tolerant seedlings among fire treatments. For most vegetation response variables, fire effects tended to be similar among IMI classes. The application of fire alone, without partial harvesting, failed to improve oak regeneration consistently. However, given that two fires reduced stand density, the longer term application of periodic fire, coupled with natural gap dynamics, may still be a feasible management strategy for improving the sustainability of oak forests where harvesting is not permitted or desired.

TI A hybrid regularized inversion methodology for highly parameterized
   environmental models
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH

DT Article
ID GROUNDWATER-FLOW; TRANSPORT; IDENTIFICATION; CALIBRATION
AB [1] A hybrid approach to the regularized inversion of highly parameterized environmental models is described. The method is based on constructing a highly parameterized base model, calculating base parameter sensitivities, and decomposing the base parameter normal matrix into eigenvectors representing principal orthogonal directions in parameter space. The decomposition is used to construct super parameters. Super parameters are factors by which principal eigenvectors of the base parameter normal matrix are multiplied in order to minimize a composite least squares objective function. These eigenvectors define orthogonal axes of a parameter subspace for which information is available from the calibration data. The coordinates of the solution are sought within this subspace. Super parameters are estimated using a regularized nonlinear Gauss-Marquardt-Levenberg scheme. Though super parameters are estimated, Tikhonov regularization constraints are imposed on base parameters. Tikhonov regularization mitigates over fitting and promotes the estimation of reasonable base parameters. Use of a large number of base parameters enables the inversion process to be receptive to the information content of the calibration data, including aspects pertaining to small-scale parameter variations. Because the number of super parameters sustainable by the calibration data may be far less than the number of base parameters used to define the original problem, the computational burden for solution of the inverse problem is reduced. The hybrid methodology is described and applied to a simple synthetic groundwater flow model. It is then applied to a real-world groundwater flow and contaminant transport model. The approach and programs described are applicable to a range of modeling disciplines.

AB This article is presented to discuss general combustion and emissions issues with biomass co-firing, as well as specific issues with particular biomass fuels, such as fouling. The tests of co-firing were carried out in a lab-scale bubbling fluidized bed combustor. Biomass is an attractive and sustainable renewable fuel to supplement coal combustion in utility boilers. Coal and biomass fuels are quite different in composition. Ash composition for the biomass is fundamentally different from ash composition for coal. Chlorine in the biomass may affect operation by corrosion. Ash deposits reduce heat transfer and may also result in severe corrosion at high temperatures. Biomass and coal blend combustion is a promising combustion technology; however, significant development work is required before large-scale implementation can be realized. Coal co-firing was successful with up to a 20% biomass mix boilers. Issues related to successful implementation of coal biomass blend combustion are identified. Co-firing of coal and biomass is an effective method of control NOx. Formation of NOx decreases with the increase of biomass fraction. This study focuses on five of the critical fireside issues associated with co-firing: ash deposition, SO2 emission, NOx formation, corrosion, and carbon burnout.

AB Polluted air has become an increasing environmental and health concern. Legislation controlling the emissions of air Pollutants (VOC, toxics and odor) has proliferated. In recent years, biological techniques have been applied more frequently to control these emissions, because they eliminate many of the drawbacks of classical physical-chemical techniques. Different waste gases require different strategies for optimal and sustainable purification. Biological treatment provides an expanding variety of opportunities for economical and environmentally friendly solutions for many waste gas emissions. In Europe, a significant body of knowledge and experience has been generated on biological waste gas purification. Examples of some interesting developments and new applications of biological waste gas treatment systems in Europe during the last 5 years are presented in this paper. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB There is growing evidence that global change and climate variability are affecting sea ice dynamics in northern and eastern Canada. Such variability could have serious consequences for harp seals Pagophilus groenlandicus and hooded seals Cystophora cristata, which congregate to whelp on ice every February and March in the Gulf of St. Lawrence and off Newfoundland. We combined a numerical and spatial analysis of weekly averages of ice data to examine the variability of ice cover in eastern Canada during February and March, 1969 to 2002. Sea ice cover varied cyclically in eastern Canada during that time and exhibited a period of light ice years between 1996 and 2002. Spring thaw generally results in a significant reduction of sea ice cover throughout much of the study area, although some regions exhibit increases associated with oceanographic phenomena. Heavy ice years correlate with positive spring North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) conditions and an in-depth analysis of highly anomalous (+/-) years (1970, 1972, 1981, 1993 and 2001) revealed consistent spatial and numerical patterns in ice dynamics. During light ice years, a synchronous and dramatic reduction in sea ice cover occurred in the Gulf and off eastern Newfoundland in the first and second week of March, coinciding with peak pupping periods for harp seals. Light ice years and rapid reductions in sea ice represent unquantified risks for pagophilic seals. These include increases in neonatal mortality, changes in food availability for pups and, possibly, increased risk of epizootics due to crowding on whelping patches. The magnitude of these risks may increase if observed changes in climate reduce sea ice cover in eastern Canada as they have in the Arctic. Patterns in sea ice cover and NAO conditions can be incorporated into short- and long-term management schemes aimed at ensuring the sustainability of commercially exploited pagophilic seal populations.

AB H-2 and synthesis gas have been extensively utilised for more that 70 years in chemical and refinery industries. Their uses are becoming today more complex being influenced by strategic, political, economic and sustainability considerations. Issues that would benefit from innovations in the synthesis gas production concern the: (a) clean fuel production and the heavy residues utilisation, (b) the gas to liquid initiatives and (c) the desired but not yet accomplished electric energy production with fuel cells. The technological needs will be examined and their accomplishment will be discussed considering the utilisation of the short contact time-catalytic partial oxidation technologies.

AB During the past 20 years, acid deposition in Europe has decreased by more than 60%, yet still a large number of lakes and streams in southern Norway have not recovered to a water quality sufficient to support sustainable populations of trout or salmon. Long-term (30 years) monitoring data were used here to constrain the calibration of the acidification model MAGIC to three Norwegian calibrated catchments. The model accounted for 60-80% of the variance in the year-to-year variations in concentrations of most of the major ions in streamwater. The results support the use of the lumped parameter acid neutralizing capacity (ANC) to link chemical parameters to biological response, as the calibration efficiency for ANC is considerably higher than for other biologically important parameters such as inorganic aluminum (Aln+) and pH. Three different scenarios for future deposition of sulfur were run: current legislation, maximum feasible reductions, and an illustrative scenario removing all anthropogenic deposition. These analyses show that much of the potential improvement in water quality has already occurred and that only limited further improvement can be expected from the current legislation. The current legislation is unlikely to produce ANC values sufficiently high to allow self-reproducing populations of trout at two of the three sites. Most of the response in water chemistry to reduced acid deposition has been rapid; the water chemical responses largely occur the same year or a few years after reduction in the input. The soil pool of exchangeable base cations depleted during 150 years of acid deposition, however, requires several centuries for replenishment. The uncertainties in future predictions come from several factors, such as future nitrogen dynamics and impacts from changes in seasalt and precipitation events. The differences in future water chemistry predicted from changed seasalt deposition or nitrogen dynamics are larger that the differences between different deposition scenarios. Hence, these factors must be included in future assessments of recovery from acidification.

AB A tubular, single-chambered, continuous microbial fuel cell (MFC) that generates high poweroutputs using a granular graphite matrix as the anode and a ferricyande solution as the cathode is described. The maximal power outputs obtained were 90 and 66 W m(-3) net anodic compartment (NAC) (48 and 38 W m(-3) total anodic compartment (TAC)) for feed streams based on acetate and glucose, respectively, and 59 and 48 W m(-3) NAC for digester effluent and domestic wastewater, respectively. For acetate and glucose, the total Coulombic conversion efficiencies were 75 +/- 5% and 59 +/- 4%, respectively, at loading rates of 1.1 kg chemical oxygen demand m-3 NAC volume day(-1). When wastewater was used, of the organic matter effectively removed (i.e., 22% at a loading of 2 kg organic matter m(-3) NAC day(-1)), up to 96% was converted to electricity on a Coulombic basis. The lower overall efficiency of the wastewater-treating reactors is related to the presence of nonreadily biodegradable organics and the interference of alternative electron acceptors such as sulfate present in the wastewater. To further improve MFCs, focus has to be placed on the enhanced conversion of nonrapidly biodegradable material and the better directing of the anode flow toward the electrode instead of to alternative electron acceptors. Also the use of sustainable, open-air cathodes is a critical issue for practical implementation.

AB Development in the floodplain increases damage from flooding. Development in a watershed also augments the potential for flooding. This study of sustainable development examines the development of a watershed in the greater metropolitan area of Houston, TX, where flooding has become a major issue and intervention by planners has been minimal. This article examines the impact of land development in a closed watershed over a 50-year period. Daily flow data from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) are combined with daily precipitation data from the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to estimate the precipitation-adjusted annual streamflow. Annual development data from the Harris County Appraisal District (HCAD) are combined at the parcel level and used to analyze the relationship between land development and outflow. The results lead to an enhanced understanding of the mechanisms that result in increased flooding and an ability to use planning tools and policies to control development more effectively to avoid watershed problems years before these problems become apparent. While impervious cover is important in determining the impact of development on watershed function, impervious cover alone is not sufficiently sensitive to guide development decisions that impact the long-term future of the watershed.

AB Within the framework of an air quality study of the French alpine valleys (POVA program), an atmospheric emission inventory concerning major pollutants: CO, NOx, SO2, CH4, particles (PT) and non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC) was carried out. This inventory has a spatial resolution of 1 km(2) and was established for the reference year 2003.
   The coexistence of economic activities and the Vanoise national park makes the Maurienne valley a sensitive site, particularly representative of the problems of sustainable development in alpine areas, where air pollution is one of the most important aspects.
   The area, which covers 4588 km(2), is an alpine valley that is sensitive to air pollution due to the emission sources (traffic, industries, private heating, etc.), its morphology (a narrow valley surrounded by high ranges), and local meteorology (temperature inversions and slope winds).
   As expected, the result which includes both biogenic and anthropogenic sources shows serious emissions of pollutants that are mainly due to the presence of highways and industries around. Two emission inventories were drawn up: one with emission factors determined by CORINAIR (from the European Environment Agency) and the other with emission factors determined by BUWAL-OFEFP (from Swiss Agency for the Environment, Forests and Landscape). The inventories were then compared thanks to concentrations calculated from a numerical model. Computations were run for an intensive field observation period from 25 June to 2 July 2003.

AB A simple method was developed to determine the relative particle foliar flammability and heat content of forest fuels. The apparatus used was similar to the one described by the 79/831 European Commission Directive for measuring the relative self-ignition temperature (minimum ambient temperature at which a certain volume of a substance ignites under defined conditions). The forest materials examined were: Cupressus sempervirens (Italian cypress), Olea europaea (Olive tree), Pinus brutia (Calabrian pine), Pinus halepensis (Aleppo pine), Pistacia lentiscus (Mastic tree), Quercus coccifera (Holly oak). These species are very common in the Mediterranean region and frequently devastated by forest fires. The relative data determined (self-ignition temperature, ignition delay times, combustion duration, etc.) provide a simple screening test on the fire hazard properties of forest species, which could be used for comparison purposes. Among the forest species examined, Pinus brutia had the highest relative ignition temperature and the longest ignition delay time, while Pistacia lentiscus had the lowest and shortest ones. Also, Quercus coccifera and Pistacia lentiscus had the highest heat content and Olea europaea the lowest one. Finally, Cupressus sempervirens was the most combustible and Pinus halepensis the most sustainable fuel. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

AB Subtropical highlands of the world have been densely populated and intensively cropped. Agricultural sustainability problems resulting from soil erosion and fertility decline have arisen throughout this agro-ecological zone. This article considers practices that would sustain higher and stable yields for wheat and maize in such region. A long-term field experiment under rainfed conditions was started at El Batan, Mexico (2240 m a.s.l.; 19.31 degrees N, 98.50 degrees W;fine, mixed, thermic, Cumulic Haplustoll) in 1991. It included treatments varying in: (1) rotation (continuous maize (Zea mays) or wheat (Triticum aestivum) and the rotation of both); (2) tillage (conventional, zero and permanent beds); (3) crop residue management (full, partial or no retention). Small-scale maize and wheat farmers may expect yield improvements through zero tillage, appropriate rotations and retention of sufficient residues (average maize and wheat yield of 5285 and 5591 kg ha(-1)), compared to the common practices of heavy tillage before seeding, monocropping and crop residue removal (average maize and wheat yield of 3570 and 4414 kg ha(-1)). Leaving residue on the field is critical for zero tillage practices. However, it can take some time-roughly 5 years-before the benefits are evident. After that, zero tillage with residue retention resulted in higher and more stable yields than alternative management. Conventional tillage with or without residue incorporation resulted in intermediate yields. Zero tillage without residue drastically reduced yields, except in the case of continuous wheat which, although not high yielding, still performed better than the other treatments with zero tillage and residue removal. Zero tillage treatments with partial residue removal gave yields equivalent to treatments with full residue retention (average maize and wheat yield of 5868 and 5250 kg ha(-1)). There may be scope to remove part of the residues for fodder and still retain adequate amounts to provide the necessary ground cover. This could make the adoption of zero tillage more acceptable for the small-scale, subsistence farmer whose livelihood strategies include livestock as a key component. Raised-bed cultivation systems allow both dramatic reductions in tillage and opportunities to retain crop residues on the soil surface. Permanent bed treatments combined with rotation and residue retention yielded the same as the zero tillage treatments, with the advantage that more varied weeding and fertilizer application practices are possible. It is important small-scale farmers have access to, and are trained in the use of these technologies. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The Plasmodium falciparum malaria is responsible for about 500 million clinical attacks and one million deaths each year, mostly in Africa and southeast Asia. On account of the parasite having become resistant to the conventional antimalarials, artemisin in-based combination therapy (ACT) is the only reliable treatment option. The Roll Back Malaria (RBM) and Millennium Development Goals (MDG) campaigns of WHO and UNDP, respectively, have made little headway, mainly because of paucity of artemisinin in world market. Here we show that the cultivation and processing of Artemisia annua, presently the only resource of artemisinins, in India, in partnerships, can help build a sound supply chain of artemisinin.

AB Two long-term mechanistic models of grazing systems in the semi-arid succulent Karoo have been used to study factors that influence vegetation changes, livestock productivity and sustainability of the ecosystem. In this region of low and highly variable rainfall, goats and sheep feed on vegetation comprising perennial shrubs and annuals. A previously published model of the Namaqualand system (the "standard" model) explicitly simulates three guilds of perennial shrubs, a guild of annuals, forage consumption, growth of goats and goat reproductive and survival rates. The model also simulates variable rainfall and predicts that, if no steps are taken to control the goat population, stock numbers will vary widely between years and the population of the different plant guilds will fluctuate. Plots of model output indicate that the system is driven by rainfall. Temporal changes in the relative abundance of each guild vary with different sequences of rainfall having similar long-term mean and variability. A single run of the model may display equilibrial, disequilibrial and threshold behaviour. Thus, the system exhibits complex dynamics. If animal numbers are held constant at the long-term average of variable stock or at the recommended stocking rate then the cover of palatable shrubs decreases and that of toxic plants increases substantially. A "simplified" model based on an aggregated forage variable and equilibrium dynamics is inadequate to describe the behaviour of this system. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Short-rotation woody crops (SRWC) are being developed as a sustainable system that simultaneously produces a renewable feedstock for bioenergy and bioproducts and a suite of environmental and rural development benefits. However, damage from defoliating insects can significantly reduce the yield of SRWC and negatively impact their sustainability. Information regarding the relative resistance to defoliation of different SRWC clones is not only useful for deployment and breeding choices, but can also help elucidate ecological patterns of herbivore specialization. Laboratory feeding bioassays tested the resistance of 19 willow (Salix spp.) and six poplar (Populus spp.) biomass production clones to feeding by seven common folivorous insects. Defoliation was measured using a leaf area meter and results were standardized according to leaf area consumed per insect per day. Significant differences in resistance were found among clones (p < .05). The most folivore-resistant groups included the six poplar clones and willow clones SH3, SP3, S546 and S625. Willow clones with S. eriocephala or S. dasyclados parentage were generally less resistant to herbivory than those with other parentages. Comparisons of univariate and multivariate approaches found that the multivariate techniques are robust and conservative, and provide an efficient means of screening a large number of clones in a development program. The multivariate approach provided a clearer sorting of folivores along a continuum of insect specialization. Such sorting may be useful in selecting model folivores to use in tree genetic improvement screening systems to efficiently reveal which clones are more likely to be resistant to multiple insect pests.

AB Fisheries management is characterised by multiple objectives. Decision making is often impeded by different stakeholders placing different importance on these objectives. While compromise solutions are often achieved, more efficient solutions might be possible if the preference structure of stakeholders was known. In this paper, the potential of choice modelling for evaluating the importance of potentially conflicting fisheries management objectives is examined. The fisheries of the English Channel are used as an example. Results from a survey of the key stakeholders in these fisheries are presented, showing that regional employment and sustainable yields are of key concern. Overall, the importance between objectives can be measured appropriately and the methodology can offer useful information to the management process. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

ID SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; KUZNETS CURVE; BALANCE; EXERGY
AB The nature of energy and material resources in a non-optimizing growth theory framework is clarified. This involves two modifications of the conventional theory. Firstly, multiple feedback mechanisms or "growth engines" are identified, such that the impact of the cost of production through demand on growth is accounted for. Secondly, a production function distinguishes between resource use, technical efficiency, and value creation. The resulting model is analytically solved under the condition of a constant growth rate. Given model complexity, numerical experiments are performed as well, providing relevant insights to the academic and political debates on 'environmental Kuznets curves' and 'dematerialization'.

AB The sulphate activation of glassy ground granulated blast-furnace slag (GGBS), such as supersulphated cement (SSC), was investigated. Environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM) and X-ray diffractometry analyses showed ettringite and C-S-H as the main hydration products of the hardened SSC paste. Changes of the composition of the pore solution were determined during hydration. Thermodynamic calculations of saturation indices for possible reaction products supported the phase observations. A satisfactory strength development of SSC mortar was observed despite low reaction rates, maximum 26 wt % of the slag, after 56 days hydration. A greaterfineness enhanced the degree of reaction of the GGBS and the compressive strength of SSC mortar The high tendency towards carbonation is a negative property of SSC. Due to a fast progressive carbonation rate a coarsening of the microstructure occurred in conjunction with a loss of flexural strength. Excessive dosage of alkaline activator led to a significant loss of strength of SSC mortar ESEM micrographs showed that ettringite crystals grew directly on the suffice of the slag grains and caused a sterical separation of the hydrated slag particles. This coarsening of the hydrated structure was the reason for the loss of strength. According to the results of this study SSC can be designed to obtain a sustainable, ecologically minded, binding material with low CO2 emission during production.

AB In order to assess the reliability of the springs near Matalom, Leyte, Philippines as a sustainable source of drinking water, we measured precipitation and outflow of five small and two large springs for the region for a period of a year and analyzed the recession spring flow data. Although monthly spring flow follows a similar pattern to that of the rainfall, the regression relationship between both parameters is poor except for the smallest spring. To determine the dry season spring flow behavior, we analyzed the spring flow data with a mechanistic recession flow model originally developed for prediction of stream drought flow in the northeastern U.S. by Brutsaert and Nieber in 1977. The model describes the dry season spring flow well assuming that the aquifer behaves as a linear reservoir. The analysis shows that the flow "half-life" for the springs is about one month. By adding the individual spring flows to derive a watershed outflow we were able to evaluate how well the simple watershed geometry underlying the analysis of Brutsaert and Nieber [Regionalized drought flow hydrographs from a mature glaciated plateau. Water Resour Res 1977;13(3): 637-43] applies to the more complex watersheds. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The methodology presented in this paper aims at analysing whether there is room for improvement of vegetable farmers' income in Canelon Grande (Uruguay), while reducing soil erosion and improving physical and biological soil fertility, and to gain insight in the influence of farmers' resource availability on the opportunities for sustainable development. The (generic) approach we developed to support re-design of farming systems in this region is unique in dealing with complex temporal interactions in crop rotations and spatial heterogeneity on farms in one integrated method, while revealing trade-off between economic and environmental objectives. Rather than an arbitrary sub-set, all feasible crop rotations were generated, using a tool named ROTAT. The crop rotations were combined with a range of production techniques according to pre-defined design criteria to create a wide variety of alternative production activities at the field scale. We used process-based simulation models supplemented with empirical data and expert knowledge to quantify inputs and outputs of production activities. We developed a mixed integer linear programming model (MILP), named Farm Images, to allocate production activities to a farm with land units differing in soil quality, while maximising or minimising socio-economic and environmental objectives, subject to constraints at the farm level. Production activities comprised current practices as well as activities new to the area. We used Farm Images to design farm systems for seven existing farms in Canelon Grande with different resource availability. The farm systems designed by the model had higher family income than current systems for six of the seven farms studied. The estimated average soil erosion per ha decreased by a factor of 2-4 in the farm systems proposed compared to the current systems, while the rate of change of soil organic matter increased from negative in the current systems to +130 to +280 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) in the proposed farm systems. The degree to which the objectives could be achieved was strongly affected by farm resource endowment, i.e., particularly by the fraction of the area irrigated, soil quality and labour availability per ha. The study suggests that decreasing the area of vegetable crops by introducing long crop rotations with pastures and green manure during the inter-crop periods and integrating beef cattle production into the farm systems would often be a better strategy than the actual farmers' practice.

AB Due to rapid loss of soil fertility in traditional cropping systems and subsequent yield decline, plantain fields in Southeastern Nigeria are usually reverted to fallow after three years. This study investigates the potential of mulch-based systems for long term plantain production: alley cropping with Dactyladenia barteri and natural bush, and a cut-and-carry technique with Pennisetum purpureum. Model results simulate yields decline observed under traditional cropping systems due to a decrease in soil fertility. The adoption of mulch-based technologies is conditioned by capital availability. However, when adequate capital is available, mulch-based systems are quite profitable. Under baseline conditions, the alley cropping system with natural bush outperforms the other two improved technologies with a 154% and 72% increase in net returns over continuous and shifting traditional systems, respectively. The traditional system had the worst performance without fertilizer use. A sensitivity analysis shows that the increase in net return due to fertilizer in the alley cropping and traditional systems is at least 25%. This analysis indicates that credit programs that reach small farmers and land reform that gives them secure title are essential to widespread adoption of mulch-based plantain systems.

TI Fallow management strategies and issues in Southeast Asia

AB For many upland farming communities in Southeast Asia the fallow-period is an integral part of their farming system. These fallow-based management strategies have often followed processes of nature by protecting or substituting for specific ecological functions of the natural forest. When exposed to a changing biophysical social, economic, and/or political environment, certain driving factors influence and condition farmers' decisional behavior leading to the development of management strategies that may either protect or destroy the forest functions of the fallow. A decision to decrease the length of the fallow period may result in the disappearance of forest fallows and potentially result in degradation due to over-intensification. On the other hand, fallow management focused on improvement of the economic productivity of the fallow vegetation itself often leaves a forest-like structure intact. Examples are presented of successful and sustainable fallow-based management strategies that were developed by farming households in Southeast Asia within the context of social, economic, political, and environmental change. Key issues are identified for research and development initiatives that begin to develop in the region to work towards long-term socioeconomic and environmental sustainability of fallow-based farming systems.

   on-farm research
AB Research-based improvements in small-farmer land-use systems are difficult to bring about. Often such improvements developed under research station conditions fail to address the true system problems or farmer concerns. In the search for ways to improve the traditional fallow system of the Eastern Amazon, field experiments were conducted in farmers' fields, but under researcher management with farmers helping to identify the critical needs for improvement. To achieve the objective a phased plan was followed: (1) exploratory research, (2) solution-oriented research with technology development and prototype evaluation, and (3) implementation-oriented research. The initial exploratory or diagnostic studies focused on (1) biomass accumulation, (2) nutrient dynamics and (3) fallow regeneration. It was found that (1) the live and dead above-ground biomass of 1-10-year-old fallow vegetation amounts to 10-98 Mg ha(-1), (2) in the nutrient balance of a crop/fallow cycle including slash burning and fertilization nutrient losses exceed inputs for N, K, Ca and Mg, but not for P, and (3) vegetative resprouting of trees/shrubs exceeds in importance their regeneration by seeds and mechanized land preparation halves the accumulation of woody biomass of a 2-year-old fallow vegetation, compared to no tillage. Instead of designing an entirely new land-use system, modifications were studied only to those practices and components recognized to be harmful to the sustainability of the traditional system itself. Also, additional components to further improve the system were tested. Thus, various technologies were developed as a set of modules. These include: (1) mulch technology, (2) fire-free land clearing with a newly developed tractor-driven bush chopper to transform fallow vegetation into mulch, (3) enrichment planting with Acacia auriculiformis to accumulate twice as much biomass within 2 years as not managed fallows, (4) modification of the cropping period by doubling it, by shifting the planting date, and by re-arranging the crop sequence, and (5) the test of modern low-input crop varieties: rice and cassava cultivars were identified for the mulch-based system which yield higher than locally widespread ones. Adoption of these modules is flexible, leaving the farmer in control of the innovation process. This last phase of implementation-oriented research, currently underway, is participatory and multidisciplinary in nature and seeks to develop and assess implementation strategies aimed at the diffusion of the farming system improvements.

AB Field experiments were conducted at two locations during two growing seasons in the Ebro Valley (Spain), to evaluate the effects of N fertilization on yield and quality of Mediterranean-type wheat in irrigated conditions. Seven N treatments and a control were investigated. The average grain yields ranged from 2117 to 5551 kg ha(-1) depending on the year and location. Grain protein ranged from 14.25 to 16.9%, and other quality parameters such as the dough strength (W) also varied with year and location, confirming the suitability of Mediterranean-type wheat and the climate for the production of good bread-making quality wheat. However, grain yields are normally low and both yields and quality can be greatly affected by the variability of this type of climate, even under irrigation. Under these conditions, grain yield increases were mainly due to an increase in the number of grains per m(2) without a reduction in the N content per spike, suggesting that N in the grain was not source-limited, possibly due to the lower grain yields and relatively high soil nitrate concentrations. In soils with lower initial soil NO3-N contents, better grain yields could be achieved by applying a N fertilizer rate of about 100 kg N ha(-1), whereas in soils with high initial NO3-N contents, no N or a maximum rate of 50 kg N ha(-1) is needed to obtain a good grain quality, showing the possibility of producing high-quality wheat with a low amount of N fertilizer and thus increasing the sustainability of the cropping system.

AB In this study, we describe the evolution of crop diversity in Flanders, using three indicators to measure diversity between crops and within crops: the Shannon index (H), the evenness index (E) - both used for diversity between and within crops - and genetic relatedness between varieties (CP). Despite the significant increase in the number of crops in Flanders, from 67 in 1950 to 101 in 2002, the results show a weak decrease in crop diversity between 1950 and 2002: H decreased from 2.52 to 2.50 and E decreased from 0.58 to 0.53. This apparent contradiction can be explained by the fact that the 'new' crops are mainly vegetables, which only have a small share in the total agricultural area, and thus hardly influence the overall crop diversity. The evolution of genetic diversity between varieties (within crops) from 1980 to 2002 is crop-specific. For maize, the number of cultivars with a high CP (>= 0.125) increased from 1.8 to 7.5%, indicating a decrease in genetic diversity. For potato and winter wheat the number of cultivars with CP >= 0.125 decreased (from 7.3 to 3.7% and from 6.9 to 6.0%, respectively), indicating an increase in genetic diversity within these crops, which is confirmed by the increase in the crops' H and E values.

AB A series of pyrazole-functional adsorbents is synthesized by sol-gel processing technology and used to study the extraction characteristics for palladium, platinum, and gold chlorides from leaching solutions. An organosilicon compound, N-(trimethoxysilylpropyl)-pyrazole, is synthesized as the functional precursor for these adsorbents. Hydrothermal treatments for the gelled materials alter pore characteristics without chemical property changes. To study adsorptive extraction of Pd(II), Pt(IV), and Au(III) chlorides, the hydrothermally treated adsorbent is used. The experimental results show that this adsorbent has high Pd(H) uptake capacity (1.41 mmol/g), strong selectivity for Pd(II) chloride over Pt(IV) and Au(III) chlorides, and no reactivity for Cu(II) and Fe(H) in 2.0 M HCl solutions. The material also has sustainable stability over repeated metal loading and stripping in a short column. In addition to the experimental studies, the adsorption processes in batch and packed column systems are successfully modeled by using a pore diffusion model and presented.

AB Growth promotion of plants by other plants and microorganisms, as well as that of microorganisms by plants and other microorganisms, is discussed. Agrostemma githago in mixed culture with wheat enhances growth and yield of wheat. Allantoin, a purine derivative and the principal component of agrostemin released from A. githago, is the growth factor. Soil amended with shoots of Solanum nigrum, enhances the soybean growth and nodulation. Growth and yield of several legumes are enhanced by mixed culture with Heliotropium peruvianum.
   Triacontanol isolated from alfalfa, and brassinolide from rape and alder pollen, stimulates the growth and yield of several crops. Chromosaponin 1, isolated from etiolated pea seedlings, stimulates the growth of lettuce by 190 %. Petunioside M stimulates the growth of cucumber and suppresses the cucumber mosaic virus. Strigolactones, isolated from host or non-host plants, promote seed germination of angiospermous parasites. Unidentified allelochemicals from Chenopodium album and Setaria viridis enhances the growth of Bradyrhizobium japonicum in broth culture.
   Seed inoculation with selected strains of Pseudomonas capacia and P. putida enhances the growth and yield of wheat under field conditions. Inoculation of soybean seeds with a strain of Bacillus cereus enhances the growth and nodulation of soybean by indigenous nodulating bacterium. Several soil microbes, with appropriate precursors, produce plant growth regulators that enhance the plant growth. Tomatoes grown in soil amended with L-ethionine at the appropriate concentration produce more and larger fruits than the untreated soil. Pearl millet inoculated with Azospirillum brasilense and grown in solution culture amended with tryptophan produces more lateral roots with greater root hair density than the control. Microbial metabolites enhance the growth of several Rhizobiuim species and promote reproduction in certain fungi. These examples indicate that the allelochemicals from plants and microorganisms have potential to enhance the yield of agricultural products, while promoting sustainable agriculture.

AB The erythrocyte membrane skeleton deforms constantly in circulation, but the mechanics of a junctional complex (JC) in the network is poorly understood. We previously proposed a 3-D mechanical model for a JC (Sung, L. A., and C. Vera. Protofilament and hexagon: A three-dimensional mechanical model for the junctional complex in the erythrocyte membrane skeleton. Ann Biomed Eng 31:1314-1326, 2003) and now developed a mathematical model to compute its equilibrium by dynamic relaxation. We simulated deformations of a single unit in the network to predict the tension of 6 alpha beta spectrin (Sp) (top, middle, and bottom pairs), and the attitude of the actin protofilament [pitch (theta), yaw (phi) and roll (psi) angles]. In equibiaxial deformation, 6 Sp would not begin their first round of "single domain unfolding in cluster" until the extension ratio (lambda) reach similar to 3.6, beyond the maximal sustainable lambda of similar to 2.67. Before Sp unfolds, the protofilament would gradually raise its pointed end away from the membrane, while phi and psi remain almost unchanged. In anisotropic deformation, protofilaments would remain tangent but swing and roll drastically at least once between lambda(i) = 1.0 and similar to 2.8, in a deformation angle- and lambda(i)-dependent fashion. This newly predicted nanomechanics in response to deformations may reveal functional roles previous unseen for a JC, and molecules associated with it, during erythrocyte circulation.

ID ENVIRONMENTAL ETHICS
AB Ethical distinctions inform all human actions and decisions. On inspection, however, dominant paradigms in tourism scholarship are imbued with the myth of objectivity and thus ignore the ethical dimension. Since the four platforms of scholarship were first published in 1990, a representation of one of the most value-based concepts of this time, sustainable development, has been embraced; a fifth platform has emerged to dominate the rhetoric of tourism praxis. However, this paper argues that a sixth platform, an ethics platform, is needed to interrogate the morality of the positions taken in policy, planning, development, and management. These platforms are proposed against a background of environmental ethics and global political economy.

AB A model of urban energy consumption has been developed using energy supply data and post-code information. The model simulates spatial and diurnal variations in energy demand, and also models the effect of energy-management measures and associated reductions in CO2 emissions. A linear programming optimisation module is used to identify the most cost-effective measures to achieve specified CO2 or energy reduction-targets. When combined with data from an associated attitudinal survey, the model can be used to assess the potential for CO2 reduction in the urban environment. (c) 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The sustainability of introduced technology in rural contexts is based on the socioenvironmental networking of local stakeholders, a point generally ignored in Ghana. A case study is given of an irrigation project from the coastal savanna of Ghana, a region appraised by contested assessments of drought and social conflict. Using a methodology based on a strand of actor network theory (ANT), including social surveys, meteorological and field data, it is concluded that such analyses of spatial linkages, serve as an effective methodology for assessing technological developments and socio-cultural contexts of various scales, and has applied relevance for environmental and development planning.

AB The hunting of wild boar during the Mesolithic was studied by analysis of age and sex distributions in faunal remains from four settlements situated in Scania, Southern Sweden. The results show that the harvest of wild boar varied between different settlements. Piglets dominate the age distribution in the faunal remains of the sites of Ringsjoholm and Tagerup, which indicate a hunting of wild boar reflecting the age composition of living populations. In the faunal remains from the sites of Agerod I:HC and Bredasten the age distributions are different, with mainly individuals older than 36 months, which is interpreted as the result of a selective prey choice of adults by the hunters. The sex ratio based on the osteometry indicates that females made up about two thirds of the harvest of the adult wild boar. The hunting seems not to have been directed towards promoting a sustainable harvest, but rather to maximise the yield of the hunt.

   LITTER
AB Submerged leaf litter is a vital resource for many aquatic species in woodland streams. However, forestry tends to lower the diversity of litter entering streams, which potentially impacts leaf-dependent species and the entire detritus-based food web. To overcome this problem, a guideline for sustainable forestry and ecosystem conservation lies in increasing litter diversity in managed forests. However, the way in and the extent to which such an increase changes the leaf decomposer communities are mostly unknown. In the present study, fungal communities were surveyed bimonthly in ten woodland headwater streams with contrasting tree diversity resulting in various proportions of leaf species in litter. A total of 79 aquatic hyphomycete species identified from conidia in stream water were listed. The differences in conidial abundance, richness and diversity between communities from the ten streams suggested a strong effect of local abundance and composition of leaf litter. Conidial abundance clearly distinguished two sets of streams, one dominated by oaks and hazel and the other by beech. The fungal richness in the ten streams showed a positive and significant correlation with the leaf species richness, accounting for 44% of the total variance among streams. About 50 % more fungal species were found in streams with the highest leaf litter diversity, and several species were more frequent in such streams. No distinct species assemblages were however associated with any particular leaf species. These findings were interpreted as resulting from substrate preferences, but not specificity by the fungal species. This is Supported by a manipulation in which the addition of a bulk of hazel leaves in a stream dominated by beech did not result in an increase in fungal richness over three months. Seasonal changes appeared to be the main factor controlling fungal species abundance. Overall, the results suggest a hierarchical pattern between riparian and aquatic biodiversity and provide an argument for the conservation of diverse tree species along streams.

AB Developing more sustainable agricultural systems that are less dependent on external inputs such as inorganic nitrogen (N) fertilizer that may affect environmental quality requires alternative N sources such as plant residues. However, to be effective it is important to screen plant material for their potential to mineralize N during the decomposition. The objective of this study was to establish statistical relationships between the fate of N from 14 diverse plant residues during an 8-week incubation in a calcareous soil at 25 degrees C and 50% water holding capacity. The residues had a wide range of N, cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin concentrations and C:N ratios. The N content of the residues was negatively associated with C:N ratio (r = -0.83, P < 0.001), cellulose (r = -0.69, P < 0.01), hemicellulose (r = -0.59, P < 0.05), and lignin: N (r = -0.67, P < 0.01). Net N mineralization or immobilization (N-m/i) ranged widely (-59.7 to 622.2 mg N kg(-1)) and significantly correlated with N concentration (r = 0.96, P < 0.001), C:N (r = -0.69, P < 0.01), and lignin: N ratio (r = -0.68, P < 0.01) of the plant residues. The critical levels of N concentration, C: N ratio, and lignin: N ratio of the plant residues at which neither N mineralization nor immobilization would occur were 11.0 g kg(-1), 45, and 6.5, respectively. Nitrogen concentration of the plant residue was the most important factor for prediction of the net effects of plant residue on soil mineral N dynamics.

AB Design professionals are increasingly faced with challenges to produce innovative designs that are durable and give good value for money to clients. However, durability is impinged upon by the interaction of different factors such as construction materials, construction method, quality systems in use at the construction stages, environmental exposure of the structural elements and their functions, ease of access for inspection and maintenance. It is therefore necessary to investigate frameworks that address the above outlined factors, for use by construction professionals. The framework should integrate the outlined durability factors and facilitate achieving the objectives of durability design that account for life cycle costs and sustainability of design options, rather than just focusing on the initial design and construction cost. This paper highlights the application of an object-oriented (OO) framework to decision-making in designing for durability in the bridge domain, and a prototype implementation of this framework. It discusses how an object-based solution could contribute towards achieving the objectives of durability and minimum maintenance costs at project level. The paper also gives recommendations for further work. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Recent international forest policies stimulate involvement of communities in forest management as a strategy to improve biodiversity conservation and the quality of local livelihoods. Increasingly, the role of local people in monitoring forest resources is also acknowledged. This paper presents a participatory resources monitoring (PRM) system developed and implemented by representatives of 12 villages, six each within and adjacent to two nature reserves in Yunnan, China. The short-term objectives are to monitor resource and wildlife abundance, resource use, wildlife damage to crops, and land use. Main methods used by the village monitoring team are: (1) observation through forest walk, (2) village interview, and (3) market survey. Monitoring is implemented throughout the year to fit in the daily work of villagers. Staff from the nature reserve or forestry bureau provide support by visiting the villages several days per year. Results indicate that participatory monitoring is a valuable tool for villagers to engage in self- owned management actions. We discuss how monitoring is also a process which could lead to social change. Based on narratives we suggest that participatory monitoring builds trust between stakeholders, changes perceptions and attitudes and leads to more democratic and transparent decision-making. In discussing accuracy, we argue that all stakeholders perceive and interpret nature differently based on different worldviews, knowledge systems, values and beliefs. We argue that if participatory monitoring is to be sustainable, community-based monitoring-preferably linked to scientific monitoring and patrolling-should be designed as a discursive institution where the process of building social capital and inter-actor learning is extremely important. Finally, we briefly reflect upon efforts to scale up participatory monitoring.

AB The need for effective global monitoring of biodiversity is clearer than ever, but our measurements remain patchy and inadequate. In the biodiversity-rich tropics, a central problem is the sustainability of monitoring schemes. Locally-based, participatory approaches show promise in overcoming this problem, but may not contribute effectively to monitoring at larger scales. BirdLife International's framework for monitoring Important Bird Areas (IBAs) in Africa is designed to be simple, robust and locally-grounded, but to produce scaleable results that can be compiled into national or regional indices. Focusing on key sites for bird conservation, identified according to standard criteria, the framework institutionalises monitoring in site management authorities and Site Support Groups (community-based organisations of local people working for conservation and sustainable development). A small, central monitoring unit co-ordinates the programme nationally, compiles, analyses and manages data, and provides feedback. 'Basic' monitoring (taking place at all sites) involves scoring of state, pressure and response trends using site information submitted on simple forms. 'Detailed' monitoring (taking place at a selected sub-set of sites) involves more intensive measurement of particular variables that relate to site management targets. IBA monitoring is now underway in at least 10 African countries, with implementation of the framework most advanced (thanks to a pilot project) in Kenya. The 2004 IBA monitoring report for Kenya provides extensive information on individual IBAs, plus indices for national trends in state, pressure and response, based on data from 49 out of 60 sites. The experience in Kenya shows that institutionalisation is vital, but takes considerable time and effort; that adequate co-ordination (including timely feedback) is key; and that participatory monitoring has many valuable benefits beyond the data collected. Further work is being undertaken to re. ne the process, improve its scientific underpinning, and strengthen the feedback loop from data and analysis to action on the ground.

ID PROTECTED AREAS
AB This paper examines how a biodiversity monitoring system based on data collected by protected area staff and local communities was established and maintained in Xe Pian national protected area, Laos. Monitoring activities commenced with project support in 1998. Protected area staff, district forestry staff and villagers continued the monitoring work after 2001 when the external advisers left. More than 2500 records of wildlife, natural resource use and threats to the protected area were collected by villagers and protected area staff, mainly through use of patrols, village discussions and village logbooks. The management interventions that followed the monitoring activities were a reaction to immediate threats or perceived trends in biodiversity rather than to trends revealed by analyses of the collected data. Patrols and village discussions came to a virtual standstill when external funding ceased, probably because of lack of supporting national policies. The annual running cost of the monitoring system was only about US$ 4000 or 0.02 per ha of forest habitat.

AB Biodiversity monitoring is criticized for being insufficiently relevant to the needs of managers and ineffective in integrating information into decision-making. We examined conservation management interventions resulting from 21/2 years of monitoring by 97 rangers and 350 community volunteers over 1 million hectares of Philippine protected areas. Before this monitoring scheme was established, there was little collaboration between local people and park authorities, and park monitoring was restricted to assessments of the quantity of extracted timber. As a result of the scheme, 156 interventions were undertaken in terrestrial, marine and freshwater ecosystems. In total 98% of these interventions were meaningful and justified, 47% targeted the three most serious threats to biodiversity at the site, and 90% were implemented without external support, suggesting that the interventions were relevant and could be sustained over time at the local level. The mean time from sampling to decision-making was only 97 days, probably because 82% of the interventions were initiated by the same people and institutions that had compiled the underlying data, bypassing potential government bureaucracy. Many of the interventions were jointly undertaken by community members and the management authorities or consisted of local bylaws in support of park management. As a result of the monitoring, indigenous resource use regulation schemes were re- established with government recognition in several parks. The monitoring led to more diversified and realistic management responses on the part of the authorities, including a more socially acceptable and effective approach to enforcement. Of the four field monitoring techniques used, the most participatory one generated more interventions aimed at ensuring a continued resource supply for local communities (X-3(2)= 69.1, p < 0.01). Although this suggests that the interest of community members is associated with their possibilities to influence the flow of ecosystem goods and services, the 156 interventions targeted, directly or indirectly, all known globally threatened species of mammals, birds and butterflies in the parks.

AB Declared in 1995, the 34,400 km(2) Kaa-Iya del Gran Chaco National Park is the first protected area in South America co-managed by an indigenous organization, the Capitania del Alto y Bajo Isoso (CABI). In 1997, based on historical occupation by the Isoseno-Guarani over the past 300 years, CABI formally demanded a 19,000 km(2) 'Tierra Comunitaria de Origen' (TCO) that adjoins, but does not overlap, the national park. The creation of TCOs and the co-administration of protected areas are elements of decentralization processes in Bolivia, whereby the management of land and natural resources is devolving to departmental and municipal levels of government. This paper examines biodiversity monitoring in the context of a community wildlife management program developed with CABI. Hunter self-monitoring (100-150 hunters per month) combined with monthly activity records for potential hunters (7637 observed hunter-months) permit estimations of total offtakes of subsistence game species for 1996-2003, as well as catch-per-unit-effort over the same time period. These data show considerable fluctuations from year to year and no declining trends that would suggest over-hunting. Monitoring populations of multiple game species can be relatively expensive, even with the voluntary support of hunters, considering data collection and analysis, as well as presentation and discussion through community meetings. At the same time, monitoring does not provide highly accurate assessments of short-term changes in wildlife resources. However, relatively simple participatory methods are important for generating information on long-term trends and for creating a context for community discussion of formal wildlife management.

AB Monitoring of fog capture and bird communities helped to build social capital for conservation at Loma Alta, Ecuador and encouraged the local community to protect 3000 hectares of tropical forest. Data collected during monitoring were used to facilitate action and cooperation at local, regional, national, and international levels for conservation of biodiversity in western Ecuador, including the designation of an Important Bird Area in the region. Through involvement with the monitoring efforts, local people became more aware of the value of ecosystem services, learned about local birds and their conservation status, became familiar with ecotourism, and began to include conservation of biodiversity with sustainable development planning in their community. The context of monitoring, the objectives and participants, field methods, impacts in terms of conservation action, and the costs and benefits of the two monitoring initiatives are described.

AB Effective biological monitoring in developing countries requires a balance of rigour and practicality. Unfortunately, there exist few general guidelines to help practitioners design monitoring programs that reach this balance. Here, we analyse a 33-year monitoring program from Ghana, West Africa, to provide both specific and general suggestions for monitoring in developing countries. Since the late 1960s the Ghana Wildlife Division has monitored more than 40 wildlife species with monthly surveys at sites throughout Ghana's nature reserves. These data present unparalleled opportunities to illuminate the scale and pattern of changes in animal abundance over time and the forces that drive these changes. We used sub-sampling of the Ghana monitoring data for four species in two savanna reserves to identify the minimum level of monitoring necessary to reliably detect changes in wildlife populations over 5-year intervals. We used a similar approach to estimate the minimum sampling needed to infer changes in abundance of hunters in reserves. Our results highlight the relative importance of comprehensive spatial and temporal sampling and suggest a requirement of no less than one monitoring site per every 285 km(2) in large reserves and 65 km(2) in smaller reserves. We discuss briefly the cost of effective monitoring and the relevance of our results to other regions of Africa and the world.

AB Participatory ecological monitoring is a realistic and effective approach in wetlands such as Alaotra, Madagascar, where important biodiversity is found in an area with high human population density. Since 2001, Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust, government technical services, regional non-governmental organisations and local communities have collected data on key species, such as waterbirds, a locally endemic lemur and useful natural resources. The monitoring was linked with environmental quizzes and an inter-village competition, which helped raise interest in the monitoring and publicise results. The monitoring has assisted wetland management by guiding amendments to and increasing respect for the regional fishing convention, raising awareness, catalysing marsh management transfer to communities and stimulating collaboration and good governance. The sustainability of the monitoring scheme and the usefulness of the data for detecting trends and guiding local managements are discussed.

AB Monitoring by local community managers tightens the adaptive management cycle by linking management more closely with its evaluation, so management actions become more responsive to the field situation. Local community volunteers, usually fishers, managing coral reef protected areas in the Philippines used simple methods (e.g. snorkeling fish visual census) to periodically monitor and evaluate reef protection together with professional marine biologists. Except for estimates of hard coral, data collected by local volunteers were not significantly correlated with data collected by biologists (specifically abundance estimates of sand, major reef fish carnivores, and fish herbivores). Community-collected fish data generally have higher variance and show higher abundances than biologist-collected data. Nonetheless, though the data was less precise, the locally based monitoring identified or confirmed the need for management actions that were generic in nature (e.g. stronger enforcement, organizational strengthening, etc.). The locally based monitoring also encouraged cooperation among stakeholders and prompted a management response. Little time and financing is required after initial establishment and replication has been increasing. However, sustainability depends upon the communities' perceived added-value of undertaking the monitoring and input from a paid and/or more committed local person (e.g. government) who occasionally conducts monitoring himself/herself and supervises the community monitoring. Management impact depends heavily upon good integration with active management interventions outside the monitoring effort per se.

AB Both conservationists and harvesters may be willing to contribute to participatory monitoring of exploited species. However, this can be costly and stakeholders need to choose whether monitoring programs or other alternatives, such as a moratorium or unmonitored exploitation, meet their objectives most efficiently. We discuss when, and how much, stakeholders may be willing to contribute to monitoring of exploited resources. We predict that communities' contributions will usually be much less than the annual value of the harvest, and will be affected by their dependency upon it; their discount rate; its cultural importance, vulnerability to overexploitation and amenability to monitoring. 'Efficient' conservationists' willingness to contribute should be similar to that of communities', since monitoring and management programs must compete with compensated moratoria. The combined willingness to contribute of both stakeholder groups will usually be much less than twice the annual revenue from the resource. Applying this framework to a case-study of crayfish harvesting in Madagascar, we find that the total willingness to contribute to monitoring is likely to be insufficient to support conventional monitoring efforts. We conclude that conservation planners must be realistic about what stakeholders are willing to contribute to monitoring programmes and consider low cost methods or negotiated moratoria.

AB Whether land management planning provides for sufficient habitat to sustain viable populations of indigenous wildlife is one of the greatest challenges confronting resource managers. Analyses of the effects of land management on natural resources often rely on qualitative assessments that focus on single species to reflect the risk of wildlife extinction across a planning area. We propose a conceptual framework for sustainable management of wildlife habitat that explicitly acknowledges the greater risk of an extinction event when considering the viability of multiple species, e.g., an indigenous vertebrate fauna. This concept is based on the principle that the likelihood of at least one event (i.e., species extinction) is the joint probability of the extinction probabilities of individual species, assuming independence among species' responses to disturbance. We present an ecological rationale to support the view that, at a spatial scale of 10(4)-10(6) ha (i.e., planning area) and a temporal scale of 102 years (i.e., planning horizon), wildlife species operating at varying ecological scales respond relatively independently to disturbances typically associated with land management. We use a hypothetical scenario of a wildlife viability assessment and Monte Carlo simulation to demonstrate that the probability of 'any extinction' is consistently higher than the probability of the 'single most likely' extinction, and that the difference between these values increases as more disturbance-sensitive species (i.e., species at risk) are analyzed. We conclude that risk assessments that rely upon the most sensitive single species may substantially underestimate the risk of wildlife extinction across a planning area. Furthermore, the selection of a planning alternative based on relative threat of local extinction of wildlife populations can vary depending on which paradigm is used to estimate risk to viability across the planning area.

AB There is an obvious need to incorporate biodiversity concerns into the policies and practices of sectors that operate outside protected areas, especially given the widespread devolution of power to local (municipal) authorities regarding land-use decision-making. Consequently, it is essential that we develop systematic (target-driven) conservation planning products that are both user-friendly and user-useful for local government officials, their consultants and the elected decision makers. Here, we describe a systematic conservation planning assessment for South Africa's Subtropical Thicket Biome that considered implementation opportunities and constraints from the outset by developing - with stakeholders - products (maps and guidelines) that could be readily used for local government land-use planning. The assessment, with concomitant stakeholder input, developed (i) Megaconservancy Networks, which are large-scale conservation corridors of multiple ownership that achieve targets principally for biodiversity processes; (ii) conservation status categories (critically endangered, endangered, vulnerable, currently not vulnerable) for all biodiversity features, identified on the basis of available extant habitat to achieve conservation targets, and (iii) a conservation priority map which integrates (i) and (ii). This map was further interpreted for municipal-level decision-makers by way of corresponding guidelines for land-use in each of the conservation status categories. To improve general awareness of the value of biodiversity and its services, a handbook was compiled, which also introduced new and impending environmental legislation. Within 18 months of the production of these products, evidence of the effective integration, or mainstrearning, of the map and its guidelines into land-use planning has been encouraging. However. more effort on increasing awareness of the value of biodiversity and its services among many stakeholder groups is still required. Nonetheless, our approach of planning for implementation by considering the needs and obligations of end users has already yielded positive outcomes. We conclude by providing suggestions for further improving our approach. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Schrodinger [Schrodinger, E., 1944. What is Life? Cambridge University Press, Cambridge] marvelled at how the organism is able to use metabolic energy to maintain and even increase its organisation, which could not be understood in terms of classical statistical thermodynamics. Ho [Ho, M.W., 1993. The Rainbow and the Worm, The Physics of Organisms, World Scientific, Singapore; Ho, M.W., 1998a. The Rainbow and the Worm, The Physics of Organisms, 2nd (enlarged) ed., reprinted 1999, 2001, 2003 (available online from ISIS website www.i-sis.org.uk)] outlined a novel "thermodynamics of organised complexity" based on a nested dynamical structure that enables the organism to maintain its organisation and simultaneously achieve non-equilibrium and equilibrium energy transfer at maximum efficiency. This thermodynamic model of the organism is reminiscent of the dynamical structure of steady state ecosystems identified by Ulanowicz [Ulanowicz, R.E., 1983. Identifying the structure of cycling in ecosystems. Math. Biosci. 65, 210-237; Ulanowicz, R.E., 2003. Some steps towards a central theory of ecosystem dynamics. Comput. Biol. Chem. 27, 523-530].
   The healthy organism excels in maintaining its organisation and keeping away from thermodynamic equilibrium - death by another name - and in reproducing and providing for future generations. In those respects, it is the ideal sustainable system. We propose therefore to explore the common features between organisms and ecosystems, to see how far we can analyse sustainable systems in agriculture, ecology and economics as organisms, and to extract indicators of the system's health or sustainability.
   We find that looking at sustainable systems as organisms provides fresh insights on sustainability, and offers diagnostic criteria for sustainability that reflect the system's health. In the case of ecosystems, those diagnostic criteria of health translate into properties such as biodiversity and productivity, the richness of cycles, the efficiency of energy use and minimum dissipation. In the case of economic systems, they translate into space-time differentiation or organised heterogeneity, local autonomy and sufficiency at appropriate levels, reciprocity and equality of exchange, and most of all, balancing the exploitation of natural resources - real input into the system - against the ability of the ecosystem to regenerate itself.

AB BACKGROUND: Feed restriction with its resultant body weight loss impacts the rodent estrous cycle; however, the manifestation of these changes in a regulatory study design has not been documented. This study reports the effects of feed restriction in the context of an FDA regulatory submission. METHODS: Adult female rats (n = 20/group; weighing similar to 200 g each) were provided rodent chow ad lib (control) or at 20, 15, 10, or 7.5 g/rat/day (g/day) during a 2-week pre-mating phase, throughout the mating phase, and up to gestation day (GD) 7. On GD 8, all animals were provided ad lib feed until necropsy on GD 14. Estrous cyclicity, mating, and fertility parameters were evaluated. RESULTS: Ad lib rats consumed similar to 20 and 28g/day during the pre-mating and gestation phases, respectively. All measured fertility parameters in the 20 g/day group were similar to control values. In the 15 g/day group, body weight was reduced by 16% at 2 weeks, prolonged diestrus occurred, and fertility was compromised due to reductions in corpora lutea. Within 2 weeks, mean body weight in groups receiving <= 10g/day was reduced by >= 29% compared to ad lib values, and overt changes in estrous cyclicity, mating, and fertility occurred. The 7.5g/day group was not sustainable beyond the pre-mating phase. CONCLUSIONS: For this study type, feed intake at <= 50% ad lib values (<= 10g/day) was inadequate due to the magnitude and rapidity of body weight effects. Estrous parameters appeared slightly more sensitive than functional measures, as body weight changes of similar to 16% appeared near the threshold of changing routinely calculated estrous cycle parameters and were later associated with reduced fertility. In general, body weight differences of 10-15% by themselves were not adverse to normal reproduction (20 g/day).

AB Groundwater from the Carbonate Rock Aquifer is extensively used for cooling purposes in Winnipeg, Manitoba. This paper examines the factors affecting the magnitude and timing of temperature increases at production wells in groundwater-source cooling applications through numerical modeling and observations at a case study site. Generic simulations carried out using typical hydrogeologic parameters for the Carbonate Rock Aquifer suggested that temperature increases of a few degrees occur at a typical production well only a few years after the start of operation in a given system. Spacing of the wells and pumping rates were found to have a greater affect than material properties in a homogeneous aquifer. A case study of a thermal doublet in the Winnipeg area indicated, however, that heterogeneities are capable of causing a departure from the predicted temperatures of the generic models. The case study showed that it is possible to make reasonable predictions of the behaviour of the subsurface temperature field during thermal development of the Carbonate Rock Aquifer. Temperature records of the length used in this study will not be available in new developments, however, and efforts must be made to conduct more extensive field investigations to ensure that designs can properly account for geologic conditions.

AB In New Zealand uncertainty about how silvicultural systems influence growth and mortality of residual beech trees has caused controversy surrounding sustainable beech management. We assess the impact of group-selection harvesting on residual-tree growth and mortality in old-growth hard beech (Nothofagus truncata (Col.) Ckn.) and mixed red beech - silver beech (Nothofagus fusca (Hook. F.) Oerst. - Nothofagus menziesii (Hook. F.) Oerst.) forests. Proximity to cuts had a major influence on growth that varied with both species and initial tree diameter. For all three beech species, diameter increment of small trees (< 60 cm DBH) in intact forest was less than that of large trees, but smaller trees grew two- to four-fold faster along cut edges than in intact forest. In contrast, growth of large hard beech and silver beech and intermediate-sized red beech trees did not vary with cut proximity, suggesting that these main canopy trees were growing at a maximum potential rate. Edge trees were more likely to die as their level of Platypus beetle infection increased, but overall mortality rates were unrelated to harvest proximity. These results demonstrate that complex mortality and growth responses to harvesting should be incorporated into forest growth models upon which silvicultural systems that sustain the structural, compositional, and functional characteristics of forests are based.

AB The Promise of Comprehensive Cancer Control
   Operationally, comprehensive cancer control (CCC) brings together diverse experts and interested partners to review together the cancer experience of their community, to identify key areas in need of improvement, to develop collaborative approaches to address individual and system changes and strategies to meet the needs of the population, and to combine resources - fiscal, relational, and intellectual - to maximize positive outcomes. Specific positive outcomes related to CCC are as follows:
   Comprehensive cancer plans;
   A cadre of collaborating partners;
   Support for the continuum of cancer-related functions and needs;
   New opportunities to learn and build skills;
   Coordinated appeals for federal, state, and private resources;
   Combined strategies to address major system changes that individual programs could not hope to address on their own; and
   Greater impact than single programs or partners could accomplish alone.
   A number of factors can at times impede success:
   Sustainability;
   Resources; and
   Competition.
   Continuing the extraordinary progress of the past 5 years will fundamentally alter the trajectory of cancer and the burden of this disease in the United States. The readers are challenged to add their voices, skills, resources, perspectives, connections, and passion to this remarkable effort.

AB Gene modification of tumor cells is commonly utilized in various strategies of immunotherapy preventive both as treatment and a means to modify tumor growth. Gene transfer prior to surgery as neoadjuvant therapy has not been studied systematically. We addressed, whether direct intra-tumoral injection of a recombinant adenovirus expressing the immunomodulatory molecule, heat shock protein 72 (ADHSP72), administered prior to surgery could result in sustainable anti-tumor immune responses capable of affecting tumor progression and survival in a number of different murine and rat tumor models. Using intra-dermal murine models of melanoma (B16), colorectal carcinoma (CT26), prostate cancer (TrampC2) and a rat model of glioblastoma (9L), tumors were treated with vehicle or GFP expressing adenovirus (ADGFP) or ADHSP72. Tumors were surgically excised after 72 h. Approximately 25-50% of animals in the ADHSP72 treatment group but not in control groups showed sustained resistance to subsequent tumor challenge. Tumor resistance was associated with development of anti-tumor cellular immune responses. Efficacy of ADHSP72 as neoadjuvant therapy was dependent on the size of the initial tumor with greater likelihood of immune response generation and tumor resistance associated with smaller tumor size at initial treatment. ADHSP72 neoadjuvant therapy resulted in prolonged survival of animals upon re-challenge with autologous tumor cells compared to ADGFP or vehicle control groups. To study the effects on tumor progression of distant metastases, a single tumor focus of animals with multifocal intra-dermal tumors was treated. ADHSP72 diminished progression of the secondary tumor focus and prolonged survival, but only when the secondary tumor focus was < 50 mm(3). Our results indicate that gene modification of tumors prior to surgical intervention may be beneficial to prevent recurrence in specific circumstances.

AB The search for durable and sustainable construction materials inspires the developments in the world of cement concrete, as well as in the world of concrete-polymer composites. Both worlds recognize, strive for and accept each other's contribution to the synergetic effects that are realized by the combination of classical building materials and polymers. A better knowledge of materials behaviour, especially in the field of admixtures, and a better understanding of curing processes allowed the development of highly performing mineral or modified mineral concretes, mortars and grouts. CPC-science becomes an invaluable element in the development of sustainable construction materials. ICPIC brings together practitioners and scientists, dealing with concrete-polymer composites in all industrial fields, but with emphasis on construction industry. The 11th International ICPIC Congress took place in Berlin, 2-4th June 2004. New trends and evolutions have been presented and discussed. The highlights of the Congress, and the synergies for the construction world that emerge from this congress on polymers in concrete in combination with cement concrete, are presented.

AB Back in 1992, the Gulf of Aqaba Environmental Action Plan (GAEAP), a collaboration between the Aqaba Region Authority (ARA), Jordan and the World Bank, gave considerable emphasis to the environmental protection of the Gulf of Aqaba [The World Bank. Gulf of Aqaba Environmental Action Plan. Report No. 12244JO (1993).]. The document recommended the establishment of a marine reserve and the long term monitoring of the coastal habitats' environmental quality. The combination of a dedicated follow up, the collaborative efforts of ARA and the Marine Science Station (MSS), and the founding of the Aqaba Special Economic Zone Authority (ASEZA) have turned the recommendations into reality. A comprehensive monitoring program of the Jordanian coastal habitats commenced in 1999. The first three years of the program were financed by a donation from The Global Environmental Facility (GEF). In return, Jordan has committed itself to the maintenance of the monitoring program as an ongoing tool for sustainable coastal management. The monitoring program includes observations on benthic habitat, fish communities, bottom sediments and seawater quality. This paper focuses on the results of seawater-quality monitoring in the first three years. Records of weather conditions, coastal currents, seawater temperature, transparency, salinity, density, pH, alkalinity, dissolved oxygen, ammonia, nitrate, nitrite, phosphate, silicate, particulate matter, chlorophyll a, zooplankton biomass, total coliform, fecal coliform, hydrocarbons and sedimentation rate have been generated monthly since January 1999 at six coastal stations, and one offshore reference station, in the Jordanian waters of the Gulf of Aqaba. The coastal stations are located at sites with different benthic habitats and are occupied by different human activities. Offshore records of density (thermohaline structure), nutrients and chlorophyll a depicted two well-defined seasons; a nutrient-/chlorophyll a-rich, mixed water winter from December to April and a nutrient-/chlorophyll a-poor, stratified water summer from June to October. Short transition seasons appeared in May and November. The mixing and stratification seasons were also clearly depicted in the coastal waters. Statistical analysis of the three-year data collected at the offshore station revealed no significant inter-annual differences in the upper 125 m of the water column with respect to any of the measured parameters. At coastal stations, the water quality at the two northernmost stations was significantly different in comparison to the upper 125 m at the offshore station and to the other coastal stations, with respect to the two key indicator parameters: inorganic nitrogen and chlorophyll a. The three-year findings of the monitoring program are employed to suggest standard codes of reference for the coastal water quality.

AB Study objective: The efficacy of using impulse oscillometry (IOS) as an indirect measure of airflow obstruction compared to spirometry after exercise challenges in the evaluation of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) has not been fully appreciated. The objective was to compare airway responses following room temperature and cold temperature exercise challenges, and to compare whether IOS variables relate to spirometry variables.
   Design: Spirometry and IOS were performed at baseline and for 20 min after challenge at 5-min intervals.
   Setting: Two 6-min exercise challenges, inhaling either room temperature (22.0 degrees C) or cold temperature (- 1 degrees C) dry medical-grade bottled air. At least 48 h was observed between these randomly assigned challenges.
   Participants: Twenty-two physically active individuals (12 women and 10 men) with probable EIB.
   Interventions: Subjects performed 6 min of stationary cycle ergometry while breathing either cold or room temperature medical-grade dry bottled air. Subjects were instructed to exercise at the highest intensity sustainable for the duration of the challenge. Heart rate and kilojoules of work performed were documented to verify exercise intensity.
   Measurements and results: Strong correlations were observed within testing modalities for post-room temperature and post-cold temperature exercise spirometry and IOS values. Spirometry revealed no differences in postexercise peak falls in lung function between conditions; however, IOS identified significant differences in respiratory resistance (p < 0.05), with room temperature-inspired air being more potent than cold temperature-inspired air.
   Conclusions: Correlations were found between spirometric and IOS measures of change in airway function for both exercise challenges, indicating close equivalency of the methods. The challenges appeared to elicit the EIB response by a similar mechanism of water loss, and cold temperature did not have an additive effect. IOS detected a difference in degree of response between the temperatures, whereas spirometry indicated no difference, suggesting that IOS is a more sensitive measure of change in airway function.

AB We have demonstrated that the aminopropyl stationary phase (APS2) already used for analysis of polar compounds in hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography can be successfully used in capillary electrochromatography. First, it was shown that the APS2 packing material affords a sustainable electroosmotic flow, the direction and magnitude of which depend on the nature of the electrolyte ions. A triple-layer model is proposed to describe this particular behaviour of the aminopropyl stationary phase. Finally, application to the separation of the tetracycline antibiotics used as test compounds in capillary electrochromatography is described and it is demonstrated that the final separation may be manipulated because of the electromigration and retention properties of the compounds, although migration times cannot be accurately predicted.

AB Objective: To critically review studies evaluating the effects of external rhythmical cueing on gait in patients with Parkinson's disease.
   Methods: Articles published from 1966 to January 2005 were searched by two physiotherapists in MEDLINE, PiCarta, PEDRo, Cochrane, DocOnline, CINAHL and SUMSEARCH. To be included, articles had to investigate the effects of external rhythmical cueing (i.e., auditory, visual or tactile cueing) on gait parameters in patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease. Both controlled and noncontrolled studies were included. Based on the type of design and methodological quality a meta-analysis or best-evidence synthesis was applied.
   Results: Twenty-four studies (total number of patients = 626) out of the 159 screened studies were evaluated in this systematic review. Two out of 24 were randomized controlled trails (FICT), both of high methodological quality. One RCT did not focus specifically on external rhythmical cueing of individual patients with Parkinson's disease, but on group exercises in general, including walking with cues. All other studies were pre-experimental studies. Best-evidence synthesis showed strong evidence for improving walking speed with the help of auditory cues. Insufficient evidence was found for the effectiveness of visual and somatosensory cueing.
   Conclusion: Only one high-quality study, specifically focused on the effects of auditory rhythmical cueing, suggesting that the walking speed of patients with Parkinson's disease can be positively influenced. However, it is unclear whether positive effects identified in the laboratory can be generalized to improved activities of daily living (ADLs) and reduced frequency of falls in the community. In addition, the sustainability of a cueing training programme remains uncertain.

AB We examine the effects of recreational scuba diving in the Saba Marine Park in the Netherlands Antilles over a nine- year period. Levels of diving have remained low whereas dive fees have provided a major source of income to this park. We studied 5 dive sites where the average number of dives per site per year ranged from 445 to 2,163. At each site we recorded benthic parameters and levels of damage within at least 25 randomly placed quadrats in areas designated to be High use ( 0 - 20 m from mooring) or Low use ( 40 - 60 m from moorings), at yearly or biennial intervals. Within the same dive site, there was significantly more broken coral and fragments of live coral in High use areas than Low use. However, across sites, damage was not significantly related to diving intensity and nor did it accumulate over time. The Saba Marine Park shows that it is possible to fund protection at sustainable levels of use.

ID INVENTORY
AB Decision support systems have played a prominent role in the implementation of forest management since the early 1980s. However, whereas early systems were typically designed to address relatively simple management questions, more modern systems are increasingly being called upon to address the challenges posed by issues surrounding forest ecosystem management, sustainable forest management, and adaptive management. This paper considers some of the key requirements as they apply to forestry in the United States, and reviews recent decision support system designs in the United States, considering the extent to which they are satisfying the requirements, and opportunities for their continued evolution. The three systems discussed, NED, LMS, and EMDS, are typical of recent approaches to system design insofar as each has taken an evolutionary approach to system implementation in order to develop effective, integrated decision support for forest management in this new, complex problem domain. On considering the current state of system development for the three systems, it is concluded that significant progress has, in fact, been made in the last few years in providing support for evaluation and planning, although it is equally true that substantial opportunities remain for continued development to support plan implementation and forest ecosystem monitoring.

AB The Forest Time Machine is a forest decision-support system developed within the SUFOR (Sustainable Forestry in Southern Sweden) research programme. The system simulates the development of a forest area of up to about 25,000 ha, and results can be evaluated from a number of different perspectives. For a given area, a management alternative is chosen for each stand, and the system calculates the development of the stands in 5-year intervals for a specified time (normally > 100 years). An ordinary forest stand database is the minimum data requirement. Depending on what kinds of issues are to be analysed, additional data sources may be included. Particularly for multi-purpose forestry, it is very important to analyze different issues simultaneously. The system includes modules for tree growth, regeneration, mortality and decay of dead wood, forestry operations, economics, nutrient balances, and biodiversity indicators. A model for estimating the probability of wind-throw will be included as well. The current system does not optimize. Management alternatives are specified by the user. Its primary purpose is to evaluate and compare different management strategies for achieving multiple objectives over a planning horizon. Because the system is used in conjunction with a geographic information system, it is spatially explicit and has proven useful for analysing time and space interactions. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB Sustainable forest management requires new tools to analyze spatial and temporal forest dynamics and to examine those forest parameters that are related to sustainability. We built a prototype system for data analysis and decision-making at forest enterprise level by integrating a forest ecosystem model EFIMOD-PRO, (long-term prediction of forest growth and soil development) with an interactive visualization system CommonGIS for analysis of spatially and temporally related data. Using the prototype, a case study in Central European Russia simulated four silvicultural regimes over 200 years: natural development, selective forestry, legal forestry according to the Russian forestry legislation, and illegal forest practice. Exploratory analysis of the simulation results demonstrated that (1) natural stand development is the best alternative for carbon sequestration; (2) legal forest management is the best regime for timber production; (3). selective forestry combines the advantages of two previous strategies, and can be the best strategy for implementing sustainable forest management; and (4) illegal forest practices lead to a fast decrease in forest productivity and decreasing biodiversity. Interactive and dynamic visualizations With maps and statistical graphics played a crucial role in data cleaning, model validation, and analysis of simulation results. The case study demonstrated the potential of integrating forest ecosystem models with exploratory data visualization for the analysis and expert evaluation at the local level. The prototype can be used to present ecological and silvicultural consequences of various management practices to stakeholders and differing social groups, thus stimulating effective decision-making for sustainable forestry.

AB Forest management decisions are often based on long-range projections of future forest conditions. These conditions and effects can be complex and difficult to understand for those not trained or experienced in forest management. Modern computer-based environmental data visualization systems have been found to be of considerable assistance in this context. Cost effective computer visualization techniques have made it increasingly feasible to visually represent environmental conditions that are otherwise only represented by abstract statistics. Currently, members of the Collaborative for Advanced Landscape Planning at the University of British Columbia are investigating the effectiveness of various environmental data visualization methods as applied to land management decision-making processes. Preliminary results of this work are discussed and the implications of the use of these technologies in a variety of contexts are examined. This work allows forest and environmental modelers to see statistical outputs in ways never before accessible to them and by so doing to gain insights into the assumptions and limitations of their models. Interdisciplinary forest management teams may more effectively reach a mutual understanding of expected changes in forest conditions, and of the effects of biophysical agents on those conditions. Additionally, increased understanding and communication between disciplines are facilitated by these technologies and a shift from weak to strong interdisciplinary research can be realized. By observing precise, near-photo realistic visualizations, concerned public audiences also may better understand and appreciate the motivations and intentions of proposed forest management actions, though there is a risk of misinterpretation of the visualizations or misplaced belief in the underlying,models. These and other potential uses of environmental/data Visualizations in the context of sustainable forest management are reviewed and evaluated using examples from recently completed and ongoing pilot projects.

AB Three major components of participatory decision-making, namely knowledge, communication and reporting, are reviewed. A prototype knowledge management system based on these components is developed in the context of community forestry. The system addresses key issues such as differences in literacy levels, interests and technical capability of the participating individuals and organizations, and is structured around a hierarchical structure of Principles, Criteria and Indicators (PC&I). The system automates production of customized reports that can be prepared as hard copy documents, web pages or audio (narrated) reports on cassette and in a selected language. The reporting structure permits individuals to contribute material to interim reports and facilitates the tracking of their knowledge contribution to the decision process. These customized reports mitigate problems of information overload, as well as increasing the satisfaction of the recipients with the participatory process. The system is used as a basis for discussion of alternative system designs and issues related to interactions between humans and computers, from which a new system design philosophy of "Adaptive Knowledge Management" is developed.

AB In today's working environment, a company's human resources are truly the only sustainable competitive advantage. Product innovations can be duplicated, but the synergy of a company's workforce cannot be replicated. It is for this reason that not only attracting talented employees but also retaining them is imperative for success. The study of employee turnover has attempted to explain why employees leave and how to prevent the drain of employee talent. This paper focuses on using a neural network (NN) to predict turnover. If turnover can be found to be predictable the identification of at-risk employees will allow us to focus on their specific needs or concerns in order to retain them in the workforce. Also, by using a Modified Genetic Algorithm to train the NN we can also identify relevant predictors or inputs, which can give us information about how we can improve the work environment as a whole. This research found that a NNSOA trained NN in a 10-fold cross validation experimental design can predict with a high degree of accuracy the turnover rate for a small mid-west manufacturing company.

AB Social and cultural institutions influence how societies organize themselves to extract,resources, affecting the ways in which resources are used and ultimately managed. In Papua New Guinea, marine tenure rights largely determine bow individuals and communities use inshore marine resources. Whether institutions of customary marine tenure can play a role in resource conservation or are simply mechanisms to avoid conflict and maximize exploitation is a matter of debate. In the Manus Province, an unusual marine tenure and trade arrangement has resulted in the community of Andra producing the majority of lime powder used for consumption with betel nut. A socioeconomic and ecological assessment revealed that more than 90% of Andra's community was engaged in lime production, an industry contributing an estimated US$102,000 +/- 28,000 to the village annually. The main source of material used in lime production at Andra is live branching coral (primarily Acropora spp.). The annual removal of approximately 2,113 +/- 660 m(3) of coral appears to have produced significant changes in coral cover in Andra's reefs, resulting in a lower percent cover of bard corals (24 +/- 2% SE) compared with neighboring reefs with little harvesting (33 +/- 3% SE). Existing common-property regimes may provide incentives for individuals to sustainably use their own reef area. A lapse in supply, however, could threaten the community's virtual monopoly and provide other villages with an opportunity to gain a market share of lime production. Thus, the marine tenure and trade arrangements that facilitated Andra's position as the dominant supplier of lime to the province may result in incentives for the overexploitation of coral in ways that are paradoxical to an open-access scenario. Management interventions that aim to reduce the ecological impacts of coral harvesting should reflect the community's economic dependence on the practice and the sociocultural institutions that influence resource use.

AB An understanding of the weed population dynamics under reduced tillage systems is essential in order to achieve successful weed control without using herbicides under a sustainable soil management system. A switch from conventional to conservational tillage alters the weed species composition and temporal pattern of emergence of weeds. A two-season experiment was conducted in 2000/2001 and 2001/2002 winters to determine the effect of Astragalus sinicus L. as a cover crop in wheat under minimum tillage (MT) and no-tillage (NT) as compared to conventional tillage (CT) on a clay loam soil. In both seasons, total weed biomass was greater in the no-tillage system and the continuous cultivation significantly reduced all the major weed species. Row seeding of A. sinicus resulted in lower weed biomass than broadcasting. Repeated cultivation affected wheat until the heading stage irrespective of the tillage or presence of the cover crop but the effect on ripening stage was not significant. Although, NT resulted in the lowest yield under the given conditions, successive cultivation of wheat with the incorporation of the cover crop did not affect the wheat yield significantly. An increase in the prevalence of weeds was observed as the degree of tillage was reduced but successive cultivation reduced the overall biomass significantly. The results showed the significance of a row seeded cover crop with wheat under MT in order to achieve comparable yield with CT. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Foodborne trematodiasis is an emerging public health problem, particularly in Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific region. We summarize the complex life cycle of foodborne trematodes and discuss its contextual determinants. Currently, 601.0, 293.8, 91.1, and 79.8 million people are at risk for infection with Clonorchis sinensis, Paragonimus spp., Fasciola spp., and Opisthorchis spp., respectively. The relationship between diseases caused by trematodes and proximity of human habitation to suitable freshwater bodies is examined. Residents living near freshwater bodies have a 2.15-fold higher risk (95% confidence interval 1.38-3.36) for infections than persons living farther from the water. Exponential growth of aquaculture may be the most important risk factor for the emergence of foodborne trematodiasis. This is supported by reviewing aquaculture development in countries endemic for foodborne trematodiasis over the past 10-50 years. Future and sustainable control of foodborne trematodiasis is discussed.

TI Evaluating projects that are potentially eligible for Clean Development
   Mechanism (CDM) funding in the South African context: a case study to
   establish weighting values for sustainable development criteria
SO ENVIRONMENT AND DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS
LA English
DT Article
ID HIERARCHY; INDICATORS; MANAGEMENT; PRIORITIES
AB Development projects that are potentially eligible for Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) funding under the Kyoto Protocol, require final approval from the host countries where the projects are to be implemented. The approval requires an evaluation of the positive contribution of the CDM project to sustainable development in the host country. A prototype set of sustainable development criteria is introduced using an evaluation process conducted in South Africa. Weighting values that reflect societal priorities in South Africa are required for these criteria. The paper shows how judgements of industry decision makers and the expenditure trends of the national government (on environmental sub-criteria) can be used to generate a first approximation of such weighting values. The industry judgements are obtained from an Analytical Hierarch Process (AHP) survey. They reflect the perceptions of the automotive supply chain and process industry only, and not other parts of the South African society. A more comprehensive study is required to determine the political and social acceptability of the AHP approach, which should be initiated and managed by the Designated National Authority (DNA) of South Africa.

TI Urban livelihoods from children's perspectives: protecting and promoting
   assets on the streets of Dhaka
SO ENVIRONMENT AND URBANIZATION
LA English
DT Article
ID POVERTY; POOR; STRATEGIES
AB This paper investigates what children in street situations in Dhaka value as important, and how they protect and promote their livelihoods when living on the street. It argues that, despite the common belief held by many people in mainstream society, in the realm of policy and in NGOs, these children are not destitute. They have dynamic portfolios of assets and show complex coping strategies generally managed in a group. Men considering policy implications, this paper argues that to be effective, sustainable and respectful, intervention has to abandon the focus on children's deprivations often fostered by a strict interpretation of children's rights. On the contrary, a more systematic investigation of children's initiatives to improve their lives when on the street should guide interventions on how to help them strengthen their assets, rather than to create substitutes for them.
   "People think we don't have anything because we live on the street. They don't see the many things we can have even if living here... You can say I am poor but I'm not a 'kangali'.((1)) NGOs give us what they want without asking us what is important for us. But we could not live without certain things we value important and we do what we can to get them." (Fumala, 17-year-old girl).

AB This paper investigates the recently launched privatization of local solid waste management in Cairo, focusing oil its adverse effects on the economy and oil the urban settlement system of the Zabaleen garbage collectors' communities. According to the official development strategy, the privatization of solid waste services is fundamental to overall government plans for the rehabilitation of areas of historical Cairo. But the objectives of the rehabilitation plans tend to favour business interests while threatening the interests of the local population. The findings of a study oil the situation emphasize the significance of poverty alleviation initiatives in restructuring solid waste collection and developing the recycling industry, and the development of new channels for cooperation and partnership between the garbage collectors' association (Gammiya), grassroots organizations, local authorities and multinational waste management companies. In order to promote sustainable livelihoods and better opportunities for the urban poor, the study emphasizes the need among the low-income Zabaleen to draw oil the sustainable flow of local resources, while seeking new means of supporting land acquisition and its development for improved housing standards, basic services and environmental quality.

TI Sustaining Cuttack's urban service improvements: exploring the levers
SO ENVIRONMENT AND URBANIZATION
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper explores concerns relating to the DFID-funded Cuttack Urban Services Improvement Project (CUSIP) in the state of Orissa, one of the most challenging areas of India with its constant exposure to floods, drought, famine and cyclones, and associated social, economic and political complexities. It describes the achievements of the project, both in terms of infrastructure "hardware" and social "software" benefits, which are equally part of the "new infrastructure agenda ". It also points to reasons for the failure to achieve all of the original project targets in terms of coverage, upgrading provision of basic services, and linking them to citywide networks. It raises, in particular, post-project sustainability issues relating to the management of the increased infrastructure asset base that resulted from the project. Recommendations for action at both the municipal and community levels are presented, for immediate management of post-project issues involving institution building, and retaining and revitalizing the existing institutions.

AB We propose a biodiversity credit system for trading endangered species habitat designed to minimize and reverse the negative effects of habitat loss and fragmentation, the leading cause of species endangerment in the United States. Given the increasing demand for land, approaches that explicitly balance economic goals against conservation goals are required. The Endangered Species Act balances these conflicts based on the cost to replace habitat. Conservation banking is a means to manage this balance, and we argue for its use to mitigate the effects of habitat fragmentation. Mitigating the effects of land development on biodiversity requires decisions that recognize regional ecological effects resulting from local economic decisions. We propose Landscape Equivalency Analysis (LEA), a landscape-scale approach similar to HEA, as an accounting system to calculate conservation banking credits so that habitat trades do not exacerbate regional ecological effects of local decisions. Credits purchased by public agencies or NGOs for purposes other than mitigating a take create a net investment in natural capital leading to habitat defragmentation. Credits calculated by LEA use metapopulation genetic theory to estimate sustainability criteria against which all trades are judged. The approach is rooted in well-accepted ecological, evolutionary, and economic theory, which helps compensate for the degree of uncertainty regarding the effects of habitat loss and fragmentation on endangered species. LEA requires application of greater scientific rigor than typically applied to endangered species management on private lands but provides an objective, conceptually sound basis for achieving the often conflicting goals of economic efficiency and long-term ecological sustainability.

AB Mangrove ecosystems in Sri Lanka are increasingly under threat from development projects, especially aquaculture. An economic assessment is presented for a relatively large (42 ha) shrimp culture development proposed for the Relkawa Lagoon system in the south of Sri Lanka, which involved an extended cost-benefit analysis of the proposal and an estimate of the "total economic value" (TEV) of a mangrove ecosystem. The analysis revealed that the internal benefits of developing the shrimp farm are higher than the internal costs in the ratio of 1.51. However, when the wider environmental impacts are more comprehensively evaluated, the external benefits are much lower than the external costs in a ratio that ranges between 1:6 and 1: 11. In areas like Rekawa, where agriculture and fisheries are widely practiced at subsistence levels, shrimp aquaculture developments have disproportionately large impacts on traditional livelihoods and social welfare. Thus, although the analysis retains considerable uncertainties, more explicit costing of the environmental services provided by mangrove ecosystems demonstrates that low intensity, but sustainable, harvesting has far greater long-term value to local stakeholders and the wider community than large shrimp aquaculture developments.

AB As environmental issues have become increasingly important in economic research and policy for sustainable development, firms in the private sector have introduced environmental and social issues in conducting their business activities. Such behaviour is tracked by the Dow Jones Sustainable Indexes (DJSI) through financial market indexes that are derived from the Dow Jones Global Indexes. The sustainability activities of firms are assessed using criteria in three areas, namely economic, environmental and social. Risk (or uncertainty) is analysed empirically through the use of conditional volatility models of investment in sustainability-driven firms that are selected through the DJSI. The empirical analysis is based on financial econometric models to determine the underlying conditional volatility, with the estimates showing that there is strong evidence of volatility clustering, short and long run persistence of shocks to the index returns, and asymmetric leverage between positive and negative shocks to returns.

AB An understanding of the behavior of the groundwater body and its long-term trends are essential for making any management decision in a given watershed. Geostatistical methods can effectively be used to derive the long-term trends of the groundwater body. Here an attempt has been made to find out the long-term trends of the water table fluctuations of a river basin through a time series approach. The method was found to be useful for demarcating the zones of discharge and of recharge of an aquifer. The recharge of the aquifer is attributed to the return flow from applied irrigation. In the study area, farmers mainly depend on borewells for water and water is pumped from the deep aquifer indiscriminately. The recharge of the shallow aquifer implies excessive pumping of the deep aquifer. Necessary steps have to be taken immediately at appropriate levels to control the irrational pumping of deep aquifer groundwater, which is needed as a future water source. The study emphasizes the use of geostatistics for the better management of water resources and sustainable development of the area.

AB Flow-through columns packed with "aged" zero-valent iron (ZVI) between layers of soil and sand were constructed to mimic a one-dimensional permeable reactive iron barrier (PRB). The columns were continuously fed RDX (hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine, ca. 18 mg l(-1)) for over one year. Two columns were bioaugmented with dissimilatory iron reducing bacteria (DIRB) Shewanella algae BrY or Geobacter metallireducens GS-15 to investigate their potential to enhance the reactivity of aged iron by reductive dissolution of passivating iron oxides or via production of biogenic reactive minerals. A third column was not bicaugmented to evaluate colonization by indigenous soil microorganisms. [C-14]-RDX was completely removed in all columns at the start of the iron layer, and concentration profiles showed rapid and sustainable RDX removal over one year; however, a phylogenetic profile conducted after one year using DGGE analysis of recovered DNA, did not detect S. algae BrY or G. metallireducens in their respective columns. Bacterial DNA was recovered from within the ZVI. Several unidentified C-14-labeled by products were present in the effluent of all columns. Dissolved C-14 removal and the detection of dissolved inorganic C-14 in these columns (but not in the sterile control) suggest microbial-mediated mineralization of RDX and sorption/precipitation of degradation products. Enhanced RDX mineralization in bioaugmented columns was temporary relative to the indigenously colonized column. However, shorter acclimation periods associated with bioaugmented PRBs may be desirable for rapid RDX mineralization, thereby preventing breakthrough of potentially undesirable by products. Overall, these results show that high RDX removal efficiency by ZVI-PRBs is achievable and sustainable and that the efficacy and start-up of ZVI-PRBs might be enhanced by bioaugmentation.

AB Currently, environmental regulations induce industrialists to implement source reduction techniques in order to comply with the prevention principle toward sustainable development. The project PIPSI (PHotage Propre des Systymes Industriels /industrial system dean piloting) financing by Rhone-Alps Region is carried out with the aim to contribute to this objective. The study presented in this article concerns the pollution transfer in a metal finishing treatment line in order to minimise the environmental impact obtained notably with the pollution balance. Drag-out and draining phenomena have been particularly studied. Results obtained showed that a 10 seconds of draining reduced drag-out from 65 to 85% in terms of pieces design. Moreover, during the experiments, 5 drag-out levels were identified by medium values from 26 to 1700 ml m. So that, either a piece can be associated to a level or knowing the piece drag-out level, it is possible to evaluate its medium drag-out value. Then the pollution balance will be obtained more easily.

ID INVESTMENT; IMPACTS
AB This paper attempts to describe the potential of urban transport infrastructure projects such as metro, regional rail and tram, to indirectly work as a catalyst for the development and redevelopment of urban areas as well as the regeneration of declining areas. The paper presents the outcome of research on a sample of 12 European cities-Athens, Bratislava, Brussels, Helsinki, Lyon, Madrid, Manchester, Newcastle upon Tyne, Stuttgart, Valencia, Vienna and Zurich. This research is part of the Transecon project which was funded by the European Commission under the competitive and sustainable growth programme of the fifth framework- and concerned with all kinds of different indirect effects (economic, social and spatial) of new transport infrastructure investments in European cities. The outcome of the research points out that urban transport infrastructure may have a catalytic effect on the development, redevelopment and regeneration of urban areas but there are a lot of other influencing factors which make such re-Urbanization processes a successful or unsuccessful story.

TI A critical analysis of the agronomic and economic sustainability of
   organic coffee production
SO EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
ID SOIL FERTILITY; ARABICA; FARMS; IMPROVEMENT; CACAO; YIELD
AB Organic coffee is one of several types of speciality coffees selling at a premium over mainstream coffees because of distinct origin and flavour, environment-friendly production or socio-economic concerns for the smallholder coffee growers. The demand for organic coffee in Western Europe, North America and,Japan exceeds the present supply, which is still small (< 1% of annual world production). More than 85% of organic coffees come from Latin America and practically all is (washed) arabica coffee. The production of certified organic coffee follows the principles of organic farming developed in Europe and the United States out of concern for the perceived negative effects of conventional high-input agriculture on health and environment. It claims superior ecological sustainability in combination with sound economic viability. A rather complex and expensive system of certification has to be passed before such coffees can be sold as truly organic. Growers adhering to the strict rules of organic coffee production may to some extent share the concern of the health- and environment-conscious consumers, but they are motivated primarily by the economic benefits from the premium received for certified organic coffee. Nevertheless, there appears to be considerable injustice between the extreme preconditions demanded for 'organics' by the largely urban consumer of the industrialized world and the modest rewards received by the organic coffee growers for their strenuous efforts. from an agronomic point of view, there is also considerable ground for criticism on the principles of organic farming when applied to coffee. For instance, to sustain economically viable yield levels (It green coffee ha(-1) year(-1)) large additional amounts of composted organic matter will have to come from external sources to meet nutrient requirements (especially N and K). Most smallholders will be unable to acquire Such quantities and have to face declining yields. Organic farming does not necessarily reduce incidence of diseases and pests below economically harmful thresholds, while the humid conditions of heavily shaded coffee may actually stimulate the outbreak of others. These and other aspects peculiar to the preconditions of organic coffee production are addressed it) this review. It is concluded that the concept of organic farming in its strict sense, when applied to coffee, is not Sustainable and also not serving the interests of the producer and consumer as much as the proponents would like us to believe. On the other hand, agronomically and economically sustainable coffee production is feasible by applying best practices of crop production and post-harvest processing.

AB The following paper gives a Summary of the European Commission's research policy with regard to the ERA-NET scheme and especially with regard to the ERA-AGE project that was launched in March 2004. All the partner institutions in the ERA-AGE project are main national funding agencies, research councils or ministries. Some selected examples of programme funding by the partner institutions may demonstrate their different ways of funding research and show the great variety of programmes. The long-term objective of the ERA-AGE project is to create a Sustainable basis for the planning, implementation and exploitation of transnational research. In future, the European Research Area in Ageing Could gain an added Value from research investments by integrating existing funding mechanisms and research infrastructures, by commonly deciding on research priorities for funding activities in order to reduce fragmentation and duplication,and by the recruitment of young researchers.

DE onchocerciasis; ivermectin; sustainability; conflict areas; coendemicity
ID IMPACT
AB The donation of ivermectin by Merck and Co. Inc. has led to one of the most effective private-public partnerships controlling a disease of major public health importance particularly in Africa. The up scaling of ivermectin distribution during the last 15 years has been remarkable with almost 40 million people treated in 2003, many already on their regular annual dose. The tools that have been developed particularly by the APOC programme have been instrumental in this increase. However, ivermectin is a microfilaricide and does not kill the adult worms. Distribution will be needed for at least 25 years and latest estimates indicate that 90 million people need annual treatment if onchocerciasis is to be eliminated as a public health problem. In spite of this incredible progress it is difficult to see how the programme will be sustained, especially after the closure of APOC in 2010. A macrofilaricide destroying adult worms and safe for mass distribution would solve the problem of onchocerciasis.

AB The interactions between cage culture and wild fishery activities in three Indonesian reservoirs, Saguling, Cirata and Jatiluhur, of the greater Ciratum watershed, West Java, were evaluated using historical data and interviews with cage culture operators. In all three reservoirs, cage culture of common carp, Cyprinus carpio L., and later of common carp and Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus (L.), were encouraged as an alternative livelihood for persons displaced by the impoundment. Currently, a two-net culture system, locally known as 'lapis dua', in which in the inner cage (7 x 7 x 3 m) is used for common carp culture and the outer cage (7 x 7 x 5/7 m) is stocked with Nile tilapia, is practised. On average each cage is stocked with approximately 100 kg fingerlings each of common carp and Nile tilapia. The numbers of cages and production of cultured fish has increased in the reservoirs, but total and per cage production began to decline from about 1995 in Saguling from 2200 kg cage(-1) in 1989 to < 500 kg cage(-1) in 2002, and in Cirata from a peak of approximately 2300 kg cage(-1) in 1995 to approximately 400 kg cage(-1) in 2002. In Jatiluhur, which has a considerably lower cage density, total fish production and production per cage has increased since 2000, and currently is approximately 4000 kg cage(-1), close to production in the early years of cage culture activities. The cage culture operations also resulted in substantial nutrient loading, estimated at 3.2, 15.2 and 3.1 t of nitrogen and 134, 636 and 128 kg of phosphorous per year in the maximum years of production for Saguling, Cirata and Jatiluhur reservoirs, respectively. In later years, when cage culture production was high, fish kills occurred in the cages, and in Jatiluhur reservoir coincided with a dramatic decline in wild fishery catches. An attempt is made to determine the maximum number of cages for each of the reservoirs that will bring long-term sustainability of cage culture operations and the wild fisheries in the three reservoirs.

AB In the early 1980s, catch rates of sea bass in the inshore fisheries around English and Welsh coasts were decreasing rapidly, and growth-overfishing-allied to erratic recruitment-was threatening the sustainability of the stock and its fishery. A yield-per-recruit analysis, based on regional exploitation patterns, demonstrated that an increase in the age at first capture would improve long-term yields and boost recruitment to the spawning stock. A public discussion paper was widely distributed, explaining the management objective, to increase the size at first capture to a minimum of 38 cm total length, its scientific rationale and means of achievement. Thirteen regional consultation meetings were held with stakeholders to judge the practicality and likely impact of introducing appropriate technical measures. We describe the introduction of a package of technical measures aimed at protecting sea bass < 36cm and evaluate the effectiveness of a national minimum landing size, complementary mesh size regulations for enmeshing nets (both later adopted internationally by the EU), and seasonal closures of 34 inshore nursery areas in England and Wales where juvenile sea bass were considered to be particularly vulnerable to exploitation. We discuss the acceptability of these technical measures to stakeholders and evaluate this conservation package after its introduction, demonstrating that it has improved the exploitation pattern in the sea bass fisheries and provided both biological and economic benefits. We warn, however, that these measures may not by themselves be sufficient to achieve developing management objectives for the sea bass fishery. Crown Copyright (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Cages were used to investigate the mortality after catch and release angling of the demersal reef fish Glaucosoma hebraicum (Family Glaucosomatidae), a recreationally and commercially important species in southwestern Australia. The effects of capture depth, venting the swim bladder, two types of hooks and anatomical hooking location, on mortality of G. hebraicum were examined by simulating actual catch and release fishing by recreational anglers. Additional factors (length of fish, duration of caging and the ability of released fish to swim) were included in a logistic regression. Only depth (p < 0.01), duration of caging (p = 0.01) and hook location (p = 0.01) were significant factors in predicting whether or not a fish died after release. Mortality of G. hebraicum increased with depth of capture from 21% at 0-14 m to 86% at 45-59 m. Timing of mortality within the experiment (duration of caging) varied with depth due to the severity of barotrauma. Overall, 51% of all G. hebraicum caught in the experiment died. Most deaths (38.4% mortality of the total catch) were attributed to barotrauma while the remainder (13.2%) was caused by damage by hooks. The high post-release mortality of G. hebraicum at any given depth compared to other demersal species is best explained by their susceptibility to barotrauma. This additional source of mortality must be considered when setting sustainable catch levels for controls on exploitation rates. Traditional management strategies that assume the survival of undersize or excess fish that are returned to the water are not appropriate for G. hebraicum, particularly in deeper waters. Alternative management options must be developed to protect this slow growing, long-lived species. Crown Copyright (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Publics* and woodlands in England: well-being, local identity, social
   learning, conflict and management
SO FORESTRY
LA English

ID VALUES; FOREST
AB People's values and ways of viewing and interpreting the world around them provide the framework in which they assess and describe their use of woodlands and debate and understand wider environmental issues. Publics' values for woodlands and trees are a key element of sustainable forest management, as values underlie people's actions and behaviour and, without a greater understanding and awareness of this, organizations will often continue to experience conflict over management. The research described in this paper focuses on the social and cultural values of woodlands and trees in both urban and rural areas in the north-west and south-east of England. Using a qualitative methodology, in-depth discussion groups were held with a range of respondents from different socio-economic backgrounds to discuss people's relationships and interactions with woodlands. The analysis of the discussion group data highlights a number of major themes. These themes include publics' feelings of well-being gained from using and viewing woodlands, conflict and confusion over what is viewed as anti-social behaviour and issues concerned with who owns land. The themes also highlight the importance of education and learning about the environment, people's sense of personal and community identity in relation to woodlands as well as issues of management for conservation, economic and public benefit. The research helps to describe and explain the ways in which woodlands and trees are perceived and used within contemporary society. Implications for future policy development are explored, emphasizing the need for effective public participation, the importance of addressing people's safety worries, the significance of education in a multi-sensory environment and the importance and meaning of place.

TI Crown Index: a canopy balance indicator to assess growth and
   regeneration in uneven-aged forest stands of the Coastal Range of Chile

AB A balanced diameter structure, i.e. similar crown area allocated to the different cohorts in uneven-aged forest stands, has been traditionally regarded as a requirement for achieving better growth rates and regeneration. Long-term experiments have demonstrated the sustainability of these structures, but quantitative data informing on how growth and regeneration behave under a balanced diameter structure compared with other structures have been scarce. Similarly, vertical structure has not been properly accounted for as a variable that can affect growth and regeneration in uneven-aged stands. In this study a Crown Index (CI) was used as a surrogate of a balanced diameter structure and an indicator of vertical structure. This new index is obtained by dividing the canopy area of trees in the main and upper canopy positions in a stand by the canopy area in lower strata. A CI of 1.0 indicates, on average, an even allocation of canopy area to each of four strata, namely, a balanced structure; values > 1.0 or < 1.0 reflect unbalanced structures, with excess canopy cover of large trees or medium and small trees, respectively. From data obtained from stands at relatively poorer and better sites in uncut and partially cut old-growth stands in the Coastal Cordillera of southern Chile, the effects of CI, proportion of large and small trees, canopy area, and basal area on diameter growth of Laurelia philippiana Looser (Monimiaceae) - the most important species in these forests - and regeneration of all canopy tree species were tested. Results indicated the following: the CI was most strongly correlated to the proportion of large and of small trees (i.e. structural indicator), and to a lesser extent to basal area (a density indicator); the CI was by far the best explanatory variable of growth at better sites and of regeneration at poor sites; and, in general, greater growth and more seedlings occurred as CI values decreased towards 1, which reflects a balanced diameter structure. Results support the value of balanced diameter structures in managed uneven-aged stands, but also suggest that alternative structures could be sought.

(SCS), Castanopsis fabri Hance (CAF), Tsoongiodendron odorum Chun (TSO), Cinnamomum chekiangense Nakai (CIC), Altingia gracilipes Hemsl. (ALG), Castanopsis carlesii (Hemsl.) Hayata (CAC) and Pinus massoniana D. Don (PIM), and compared with that of an adjacent 29-year-old plantation of Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata Lamb.) (CUL) in Jianou, Fujian, China. Mean annual total litterfall over 3 years of observations varied from 4.63 Mg ha(-1) in the CUL to 8.85 Mg ha(-1) in the PIM; of this litterfall, the leaf contribution ranged from 62 to 73 per cent. Litterfall in the CAF, ALG and CAC showed an unimodal distribution pattern, while for the five other forests, the litterfall pattern was multi-peak. The rank order of the eight forests, according to nutrient return mass with the exception of P, was different from the order when rank was according to total mass of litterfall. The highest annual N, K and Ca returns from total litterfall were noticed in the TSO, the CAF and the CUL, respectively. The amounts of P and Mg potentially returned to the soil were the highest in the PIM. The leaf fraction provided greater potential returns of N, P, K, Ca and Mg to the soil than other litter fractions. The results of this study demonstrate that natural forests have a greater capability for maintaining site productivity than the monoculture coniferous plantation, due to higher amount of above-ground litter coupled with greater nutrient returns; therefore conservation of natural forests is recommended as a practical measure in forest management to realize sustainable development of forestry in mountainous areas of southern China.

DT Article
AB Global sustainable development is the overarching challenge for social and economic policy today. The paper elaborates the concept of sustainable development, identifies some of the levers and policies that might help attain it, describes a modeling system used for analysis, and presents the results of evaluating the impacts of policies and an integrated scenario built upon them.
   Particular attention is given to measures related to research, technology development and the wider use of networking technologies, and to the hypothesis that investments in these areas offer a 'triple-win' opportunity for growth, greater equity and resource-efficiency. We show that the combination of policy initiatives in these areas can offer a valuable alternative and/or complement to constraints on businesses and life-styles that are commonly proposed for sustainable development.

AB During the "Green Revolution" of rice, high-yielding varieties (HYVs) were developed using a semi-dwarf gene (sd1 or OsGA20ox2). The presence or absence of the two mutant alleles (DGWG type in Dee-geo-woo-gen and JKK type in Jikkoku) were surveyed by PCR using 256 accessions of eight wild and two cultivate rice species. The DGWG allele was detected in a landrace (Oryza sativa) and two accessions of wild rice (O. rufipogon), all of which are from China, showing their limited distribution. Genealogical studies of the OsGA20ox2 gene showed that the 62 sequences of O. sativa and O. rufipogon included 20 distinct haplotypes, indicating that the species complex contained OsGA20ox2 genes from two different lineages. The silent site nucleotide diversities (pi and theta(w)) were extremely low in Japonica rice, suggesting a genetic bottleneck. The haplotype network showed that the DGWG and JKK alleles were derived in different lineages. The DGWG carrier (W1944) had unique polymorphisms in the surrounding region of the locus, suggesting that the DGWG allele has been preserved in the wild progenitor, rather than that the DGWG allele has been introgressed from HYVs to W1944. Although a semi-dwarfing plant is a weak competitor under saturated fields, the crossing experiment revealed that the DGWG variant might have been preserved as a hidden variation in the genetic background of wild rice, without expressing a short-stature.

AB Purpose: To provide a summary of the outcomes of two working conferences organized by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), to develop recommendations for practical, sustainable mechanisms to make quality control (QC) materials available to the genetic testing community. Methods: Participants were selected to include experts in genetic testing and molecular diagnostics from professional organizations, government agencies, industry, laboratories, academic institutions, cell repositories, and proficiency testing (PT)/external Quality Assessment (EQA) programs. Current efforts to develop QC materials for genetic tests were reviewed; key issues and areas of need were identified; and workgroups were formed to address each area of need and to formulate recommendations and next steps. Results: Recommendations were developed toward establishing a sustainable process to improve the availability of appropriate QC materials for genetic testing, with an emphasis on molecular genetic testing as an initial step. Conclusions: Improving the availability of appropriate QC materials is of critical importance for assuring the quality of genetic testing, enhancing performance evaluation and PT/EQA programs, and facilitating new test development. To meet the needs of the rapidly expanding capacity of genetic testing in clinical and public health settings, a comprehensive, coordinated program should be developed. A Genetic Testing Quality Control Materials Program has therefore been established by CDC in March 2005 to serve these needs.

AB Humans have exerted large-scale changes on the terrestrial biosphere, primarily through agriculture; however, the impacts of such changes on the hydrologic cycle are poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that the conversion of natural rangeland ecosystems to agricultural ecosystems impacts the subsurface portion of the hydrologic cycle by changing groundwater recharge and flushing salts to underlying aquifers. The hypothesis was examined through point and areal studies investigating the effects of land use/land cover (LU/LC) changes on groundwater recharge and solute transport in the Amargosa Desert (AD) in Nevada and in the High Plains (HP) in Texas, US. Studies use the fact that matric (pore-water-pressure) potential and environmental-tracer profiles in thick unsaturated zones archive past changes in recharging fluxes. Results show that recharge is related to LU/LC as follows: discharge through evapotranspiration (i.e., no recharge; upward fluxes < 0.1 mm yr(-1)) in natural rangeland ecosystems (low matric potentials; high chloride and nitrate concentrations); moderate-to-high recharge in irrigated agricultural ecosystems (high matric potentials; low-to-moderate chloride and nitrate concentrations) (AD recharge: similar to 130-640 mm yr(-1)); and moderate recharge in nonirrigated (dryland) agricultural ecosystems (high matric potentials; low chloride and nitrate concentrations, and increasing groundwater levels) (HP recharge: similar to 9-32 mm yr(-1)). Replacement of rangeland with agriculture changed flow directions from upward (discharge) to downward (recharge). Recent replacement of rangeland with irrigated ecosystems was documented through downward displacement of chloride and nitrate fronts. Thick unsaturated zones contain a reservoir of salts that are readily mobilized under increased recharge related to LU/LC changes, potentially degrading groundwater quality. Sustainable land use requires quantitative knowledge of the linkages between ecosystem change, recharge, and groundwater quality.

ID AGENDA
AB This article examines considerations related to the societal premises of a 'sustainable city' in the context of large southern cities. The article also reviews some alternative concepts to 'sustainable city' such as 'eco-city' and 'ecological city' and examines their suitability in the South. The article proposes that the greatest challenge of environmental urban development in the South is not necessarily the lack of environmental services and infrastructure, but the societal structures reproducing unequal distribution and malfunctioning of these services. The authors' empirical evidence and personal experience from Lagos, New Delhi, Cairo and Manila is presented to elaborate the argument. The article calls for locally defined 'sustainable city' models that consider local societal and cultural resources and constraints along with environmental improvements. In this process, sustainability is not regarded as a goal, but as a criterion for motivated and transparent administration as well as efficient, flexible and equal service provision and resource allocation.

AB Objectives. To determine if epigenetic interference can restore progesterone receptor-B (PR-B) expression in PR-B negative endometrial adenocarcinoma cell lines, and to characterize the kinetics of PR-B induction mediated by DNA methyltransferase and histone deacetylase inhibitors.
   Methods. The PR-B negative endometrioid cancer cell lines KLE and HEC-1B were used as study models. PR-B mRNA and protein expression levels were measured using real-time PCR and Western blot analysis, respectively. DNA methylation levels of the PR-B promoter were determined by methylation-specific PCR. Dose-response cot-relations and the duration of response to aza-deoxycytidine (ADC) and trichostatin A (TSA) were characterized. Cell responses to prolonged and repeated drug treatment were also examined.
   Results. Relatively low concentrations of ADC and TSA over a 24-h period induced PR-B expression. Furthermore, ADC and TSA acted synergistically to reactivate PR-B expression. Depending on the cell line used, PR-B mRNA was induced 10-110 fold. This elevated PR-B expression continued for 48 h after drug withdrawal. Sustained upregulation of PR-B mRNA and protein was observed during prolonged and repeated drug treatment.
   Conclusion. The epigenetically silenced PR-B gene remains sensitive to changes in DNA demethylation and histone acetylation in uterine adenocarcinoma, cell lines. Treatment with ADC and/or TSA results in a robust and sustainable PR-B upregulation. These small molecule epigenctic modifying agents may be used to sensitize poorly differentiated, PR-B negative endometrial cancers to progestational therapy. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

AB The purpose of this paper is to examine the utility of linking systems between public health resource and user organizations for health promotion dissemination and capacity building, and to identify factors related to the success of linking systems. The design is a parallel-case study using key informant interviews and content analysis of project reports (synthesized qualitative and quantitative data) of three provincial dissemination projects of the Canadian Heart Health Initiative-Dissemination Phase. Each provincial project used linking activities with public health user groups including meetings, skill building, resources, collaboration, networking and research feedback to facilitate capacity building for and implementation of heart health promotion activities. This paper presents empirical examples of linking system designs, activities, and qualitative and quantitative changes in the public health user groups' health promotion capacity, program delivery and sustainability. The findings indicate enhanced health promotion skills, partnerships, resources, infrastructure, and increased programming and sustainability in the targeted public health organizations of all three provincial projects. Identified barriers to the success of linking systems included lack of appropriately skilled personnel, funds, buy-in and leadership. We conclude that linking systems can be flexibly used to build capacity and disseminate health promotion innovations, and suggest conditions for success.

AB Russia has the ninth highest tuberculosis burden in the world. After a period of decline starting in the 1960s, the case notification rate tripled during the 1990s. Historically, case-finding, treatment and reporting practices in Russia have differed from those advocated by WHO and the international community: Directly Observed Therapy-short course (DOTS). By 2003, approximately 26% of the population in Russia was covered by the DOTS strategy. By contrast, the average coverage in the 22 high-burden countries is 61%. The reasons for this low rate in Russia have not been systematically examined. Using qualitative research methods we explored, in depth, the attitudes of key stakeholders involved in tuberculosis control to introduction of DOTS in a region of Russia. Six focus groups and 128 in depth interviews were held with clinicians, managers, policy-makers and patients. The results show negative attitude to change due to inadequate understanding of DOTS; perceived 'directiveness' of the I externally developed' DOTS strategy and the standardized nature of the treatment regimen. The doctors, managers and patients saw that prolonged periods of hospitalisation (the traditional way of managing TB in Russia) was advantageous because treatment routines could be ensured, medical expertise was readily available, and other needs such as shelter and food were provided. Respondents felt that the patients were unlikely to adhere to treatment in the community. Cultural issues and capacity constraints, especially in laboratory equipment and personnel, would impede introduction and sustainability of the DOTS strategy. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB A manageable cavity-nesting bee, Osmia aglaia Sandhouse (Apiformes: Megachilidae), was evaluated as a pollinator for cultivated red raspberry and blackberries. Floral visits by free-flying honey bees or by less numerous caged O. aglaia yielded red raspberry fruit ('Canby' and 'K81-6') of equivalent size. These fruit were 30% larger (1.9 g, 70 drupelets) than fruit from unvisited flowers. Female O. aglaia readily visited flowers of all eight diverse blackberry cultivars observed. For all of these cultivated Rubus, female O. aglaia were observed to invariably collect pollen while pivoting atop the brush of pistils, maximizing opportunities for pollen transfer. Within its native geographic range in western Oregon and California, this effective native pollinator could be a sustainably managed, economical bee for cultivated cane fruit.

AB We present palaeoenvironmental, geomorphological, archaeological, and place- name data which allow a holistic assessment of the history of landscape change on Sandoy, Faroe Islands, especially in terms of the changes that occurred in response to the colonization of the island by humans. In contrast to other situations in the North Atlantic region, there is considerable continuity in the patterns and processes of landscape evolution across the initial settlement horizon. Many of the characteristic features of post- settlement North Atlantic landscapes - absence of trees, widespread blanket mires, high rates of soil erosion - were already in place when the first people arrived. Although human impact on Sandoy appears to have been light, conversely, the unusual environment forced major alterations of the subsistence economy imported by the colonists. Settlement- era archaeological records suggest that, from the start, patterns of resource use differed substantially from the regional norm, and these differences became amplified over time as the Faroese economy created a locally sustainable cultural landscape.

AB In the early Norse settlement period throughout the North Atlantic, effective management of the land area surrounding the domestic settlement, the home- field, was essential. In the Faroe Islands, the extent of home- field land suitable for growing fodder or cereal crops is limited by topography and by drainage highlighting the need to optimize the management of these land areas. In this paper we examine the management of home- fields through a modeling approach, allowing the long- term sustainability of the past agrarian system in the home- field area to be examined. The CENTURY agroecosystem model is used to predict soil organic carbon levels and the potential hay meadow and cereal production for locations around three settlements on the islands of Suderoy, Sandoy, and Eysteroy. Using paleoclimatic data and measurements from buried soil materials alongside ethnographic and historical evidence on land management, the results from this model reveal maximum hay and barley yields attainable through early agrarian practices. Comparisons between modeled outputs and recorded yields from the nineteenth century show that there is a strong moderating influence on longer- term climatic fluctuations. The role of soil management is emphasized through comparison of long- term climate/ yield data. This has been undertaken using statistical time series analyses, which reveal fluctuations in yield related to climate are relatively slight, except going into the twentieth century. It is concluded that intensity of soil management is the primary determinant of yield and could buffer cereal and hay yields against climatic downturns, and that from a low yield baseline in the early Norse settlement period, yield improves to an equilibrium level by the twelfth century.

TI Sustainable rangeland grazing in Norse Faroe
SO HUMAN ECOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE historical ecology; modeling; rangeland management; Norse Faroe
ID DEGRADATION; GREENLAND; ICELAND
AB The introduction of domestic livestock, particularly sheep, and rangeland grazing by Norse settlers to Faroe during the ninth century has generally been described as a major pressure on a sensitive landscape, leading to rapid and widespread vegetation change and contributing to land degradation. This view has, however, been developed without consideration of Norse grazing management practices which may have served to minimize grazing impacts on landscapes as well as sustaining and enhancing vegetation and livestock productivity. These alternative scenarios are considered using a historical grazing management simulation model with Faroese climate and vegetation inputs and given archaeological, historical and palaeoenvironmental parameters. Three contrasting rangeland areas are investigated and, based on the maximum number of ewe/ lamb pairs the rangeland could sustain, modeling suggests that utilizable biomass declined with the onset of grazing activity, but not to a level that would cause major changes in vegetation cover or contribute to soil erosion even under climatically determined poor growth conditions. When rangeland areas partitioned into what are termed hagi and partir are modeled, grazing levels are still within rangeland carrying capacities, but productivities are variable. Some rangeland areas increase biomass and livestock productivities and biomass utilization rates while other rangeland areas that were too finely partitioned were likely to suffer substantial decline in livestock productivity. Partitioning of rangeland is a likely contributor to long- term differentiation of landscapes and the relative success of settlements across Faroe beyond the Norse period.

AB Over-exploitation of groundwater resources threatens the future of irrigated agriculture, especially in the arid and semi-arid regions of the world. In order to reverse this trend, and to ensure future food security, the achievement of sustainable groundwater use is ranking high on the agenda of water policy makers. Spatio-temporally distributed information on net groundwater use-i.e. the difference between tubewell withdrawals for irrigation and net recharge-is often unknown at the river basin scale. Conventionally, groundwater use is estimated from tubewell inventories or phreatic surface fluctuations. There are shortcomings related to the application of these approaches. An alternative methodology for computing the various water balance components of the unsaturated zone by using geo-information techniques is provided in this paper. With this approach, groundwater recharge will not be quantified explicitly, but is part of net groundwater use, and the spatial variation can be quantitatively described. Records of routine climatic data, canal discharges at major offtakes, phreatic surface depth fluctuations, and simplified information on soil textural properties are required as input data into this new Geographic Information System and Remote Sensing tool. The Rechna Doab region (approximately 2.97 million ha), located in the Indus basin irrigation system of Pakistan, has been used as a case study. On an annual basis, an areal average net groundwater use of 82 mm year(-1) was estimated. The current result deviates 65% from the specific yield method. The deviation from estimates using tubewell withdrawal related data is even higher.

AB Arsenic contaminates groundwater across much of southern, central and eastern Bangladesh. Groundwater from the Holocene alluvium of the Ganges, Brahmaputra and Meghna Rivers locally exceeds 200 times the World Health Organisation (WHO) guideline value for drinking water of 10 mu g/l of arsenic. Approximately 25% of wells in Bangladesh exceed the national standard of 50 mu g/l, affecting at least 25 million people. Arsenic has entered the groundwater by reductive dissolution of ferric oxyhydroxides, to which arsenic was adsorbed during fluvial transport. Depth profiles of arsenic in pumped groundwater, porewater, and aquifer sediments show consistent trends. Elevated concentrations are associated with fine-sands and organic-rich sediments. Concentrations are low near the water table, rise to a maximum typically 20-40 m below ground, and fall to very low levels between about 100 and 200 m. Arsenic occurs mainly in groundwater of the valley-fill sequence deposited during the Holocene marine transgression. Groundwater from Pleistocene and older aquifers is largely free of arsenic. Arsenic concentrations in many shallow hand-tube wells are likely to increase over a period of years, and regular monitoring will be essential. Aquifers at more than 200 m below the floodplains offer good prospects for long-term arsenic-free water supplies, but may be limited by the threats of saline intrusion and downward leakage of arsenic.

   bolson aquifer in the El Paso del Norte region as a complex system

   groundwater model; Brackish water intrusion
AB As the latest drought has swept over the southwestern United States, most local and regional water providers have had to rely on ground water to meet their water demands as surface water supplies have diminished. In areas near major population centers this situation has continued to put strain and stress on already over-drafted regional aquifers. Metropolitan centers throughout the southwestern United States, as exemplified by Las Vegas, Nevada; Phoenix and Tucson, Arizona; and El Paso, Texas, have a history of over drafting their available ground water resources. How these stressed aquifers should be managed is an urgent issue. In El Paso, Texas long-term groundwater mining in the transboundary Hueco bolson aquifer has resulted in large water level drawdowns within the basin, particularly in several well fields. This situation has promoted the intrusion of brackish water into fresh water zones, and consequently reduced the volume of fresh water stored in the aquifer. Management of this aquifer is made more complex as the water resources of the region are shared across the United States/Mexico boundary and the transboundary region continues to grow rapidly. This paper describes the current situation within the Hueco bolson due to over drafting and continued reliance on the fresh water in storage and describes how understanding the dynamics of the aquifer as a complex system can offer managerial perspectives that can be used to establish operational procedures and programs for bringing drawdowns into equilibrium, increasing the longevity of the aquifer, gradually restoring water quality, and offering the hope of utilization of the resource in a sustainable manner.

AB Since the 1950s, records front the North Sea show a gradual increase in temperature. Using temperature as a proxy indexing the state of the environment, relationships between recruitment, spawning-stock biomass, and temperature are investigated for major North Sea stocks. Cod, plaice, and sole exhibit significant negative relationships between temperature and recruitment, while there is evidence of a positive effect for saithe and whiting. Stock recruitment models that incorporate temperature are developed and used to examine implications for the management of these stocks with small increases in mean winter sea surface temperature. These suggest that for cod, minimum safe biomass reference points are unlikely to be achieved even at fishing mortality rates that are considered safe. The same analysis suggests that sustainable fishing for cod is still possible with higher yields than have been experienced in recent years.

AB Robustness of both short-term stock biomass recovery and longer-term sustainable management strategies to different plausible climatic change scenarios were evaluated for North Sea cod (Gadus morhua), where climate was assumed to impact growth and recruitment. In the short term, climate change had little effect oil stock recovery, which depends instead upon reducing fishing effort to allow existing year classes to Survive to maturity. In the longer term, climate change has greater effects on stock status, but higher yields and biomass can be expected if fishing mortality is reduced. Incorporating environmental covariates in stock assessment predictions will not achieve sustainable resource use. The implications of climate change for biological reference points depend upon the mechanism through which temperature acts oil recruitment, i.e. on juvenile survival or carrying capacity. It is not possible to distinguish between these processes with stock assessment data sets alone. However, this study indicates that reference points based oil fishing mortality appear more robust to uncertainty than those based on biomass. Ideally, simpler management procedures are required that meet pre-agreed management objectives and are robust to uncertainty about the true dynamics.

TI Linking climate adaptation and development: A synthesis of six case
   studies from Asia and Africa
SO IDS BULLETIN-INSTITUTE OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
AB Increased temperature, floods, droughts, extreme events and changes in precipitation pose additional risks for developing countries and vulnerable communities striving to alleviate poverty and to achieve sustainable development. Knowledge and experience of adapting to climatic conditions has been built up over a millennia by communities in many parts of the world, including developing countries, often on the basis of experimentation initiated by communities. The synthesis brings together the main insights and conclusions from case studies describing examples of successful community-led interventions in six countries: China, India, Bangladesh, Senegal, Kenya and Zimbabwe. The climate impacts studied include "headline-grabbing" extreme events, such as national floods, and quieter forms of climatic disaster such as long-term aridity/drought, temperature increase and wind-related land degradation. The synthesis examines the roles played by formal and informal institutions, policy champions, donors, knowledge and research in decreasing vulnerabilities and supporting community-led adaptation to climate change.

AB In Thailand, agriculture is one of the major occupations; however, there is no comprehensive agricultural occupational health promotion and disease prevention model available. Objectives of this study were to empower farmers to study occupational health and safety situation in rice farming and to develop model to promote their health and prevent occupational health hazards among them. This participatory action research was performed in Tambol Klong 7, Klongluang district, Pathumthani, Thailand. The 24 rice farmers from 9 villages were voluntarily recruited as members of research team called farmer-leader research group. This group had a monthly meeting to discuss issues of agricultural occupational health and safety during 3 yr study period. At first stage, farmer-leader research group analyzed occupational health and safety during rice farming process. After we had results from situation analysis, farmer-leader research group decided which problems would be solved first. We developed model to solve those problems during the second stage. Finally, model was implemented to farmers in the study area. During first stage, results of questionnaires showed that there were 3 major occupational health and safety problems among these farmers; symptoms from pesticide exposure (65% of respondents), musculoskeletal problems during various process (16.6%-75.9%), and injuries during various process (1.1%-83.2%). From these results, farmer-leader research group decided to deal with pesticide problem. There was an experiment comparing using biofertilizers and bio pest-control with using chemical fertilizers and pesticides in the rice paddy. Results showed that the biological field produced the same amount of rice as the chemical field but cost less money than the chemical one. Benefits from using biofertilizers and bio pest-control were having higher profit, less exposure to chemicals, and good mental health from higher profit. After this experiment, biofertilizers and bio pest-control were disseminated to rice-farmers and students and teachers in local schools. At the end of study, we found that there were networks of farmers and networks of students-teachers using biological methods. This study showed that participation with farmers could create a real sustainable model to promote farmers' health and prevent them from occupational health hazards.

AB The full potential of the expected role of Information Technology (IT) in facilitating organizational adaptation has not yet been realized because most of the existing systems do not lend themselves to the levels of flexibility required to support changes in business processes. This problem is accentuated with increase of inter-organizational linkages involving disparate IT systems. Web services have emerged as a disruptive technology, with a real potential of enabling flexible business processes.

AB A firm's capacity to enter and sell products in international markets requires an important degree of competitiveness, which fundamentally resides in its intangible resources. Thus, in the current work and drawing from the resource-based view of the firm, we analyse the influence of a firm's technological capacity on both its decision to export and its export intensity from a sample of Spanish manufacturing firms using non-linear regression models. Our findings show that product innovations, patents and process innovations positively and significantly affect both the decision to export and the export intensity. R&D spending intensity is not significant in the decision to export, although it is significant in export intensity. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The chemical control of groundnut white grubs, Holotrichia serrata F. and H. reynaudi Blanchard ( Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae), was studied in south-central India. Microplot trials demonstrated that chlorpyrifos and imidacloprid seed-dressings were effective against H. serrata at rates as low as 0.6 and 3.5 g a. i./kg, respectively, while microplot and on-farm trials showed that 1.2 and 3.5 g a. i./kg of chlorpyrifos and imidacloprid, respectively, were required for H. reynaudi. Chlorpyrifos residue analyses indicated that at 20 days after sowing (d. a. s.) rates up to 5.0 g a. i./kg produced residues in soil and groundnut seedlings markedly below the relevant MRL, and no detectable residues at harvest under the southern Indian rainy-season environment. A farmer survey found that in Andhra Pradesh (AP), insecticides ( chlorpyrifos and phorate) were applied for white grub control in 37.5% of farms sampled, while no insecticides were applied for this purpose in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. The white grub density on farms in AP where insecticide had been applied averaged 0.07 larvae/m(2), compared to 1.04 larvae/m(2) in the remaining AP farms. In AP, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, 70, 42 and 39% of currently untreated groundnut fields, respectively, exceed the provisional economic threshold. A survey in the Anantapur district of AP found that farmer's target and achieved rates for seed treatment averaged 0.44 and 0.52 g a. i./kg, both below optimal rates determined in microplot experiments. These data provide the foundation for an effective and sustainable program of management for groundnut white grubs in south-central India by providing key efficacy data and baseline data on farmer insecticide-use patterns.

AB The nature of the workplace continues to change as Europe adapts to the challenges of competing in a global marketplace. Across the European Union there is a trend of increasing absenteeism and early retirement due to mental health problems, particularly stress and depression. The social and economic costs of lost productivity in Europe are substantial. Moreover, the sustainability of social protection systems may be challenged further by increases in the levels of disability benefits paid to people who have left work on grounds of poor mental health. Yet despite these significant consequences, at both national and pan-European levels, decision-makers have been slow to recognise the importance of promoting mental health within the workplace, although recently there have been some positive developments. This paper outlines some of the socio-economic arguments for the promotion of good mental well-being in the labour force and identifies how they link with different national and European policy agendas around four key issues: economic growth and development, the promotion of a high level of public health, sustainability of social welfare systems and social inclusion. The role and activities to promote mental well-being in the workplace undertaken by both national and international organizations in Europe are outlined along with important gaps and challenges that need to be addressed.

SO IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE
LA English

   performance evaluation; spate irrigation; Wadi Laba
AB Spate irrigation is a method of harvesting and managing floodwater, which is unpredictable in timing and volume. In the spate-irrigated area of 16000 ha in Eritrea, the farmers have for decades used brushwood and earthen diversion and distribution structures, locally known as Agims and Musghas, to harness and share the floodwater. Although these practices managed to make the systems sustainable for the past 100 years, they failed to fully mitigate the unpredictability of the floodwater and relieve the farmers from poverty. With the aim of improving living conditions, the government decided to modernize the spate irrigation systems. In 1998, the Wadi Laba (2600 ha) was selected as a pilot project, and its major Agims and Musghas were replaced by a concrete headwork and gabions. The main targets were: expanding the annually irrigated area from 1200 to 2600 ha, diverting large floods in a regulated manner so as to increase the probability of irrigating the downstream fields, while preventing erosion and sedimentation and reducing the labour and brushwood needed for operation and maintenance.
   Field surveys, discharge measurements, interviews and group discussions were conducted to evaluate the performance of the Wadi Laba system. It was found that in an "excellent" flood season, only 1400 ha was irrigated. Reasons include: the inappropriate design assumptions and approaches in the initial phase of the modernization, the non-coherence of the modem design with the indigenous water rules and water-sharing arrangements, the failures of the breaching bund, the sedimentation in the culvert and the incorrect operation and use of the scour sluice. Among the proposed improvements are: strengthening the farmers' organization technically, institutionally and legally, replacing the culvert with a head regulator gate, constructing supplementary offtakes, converting the breaching bund into a low-crested rock fill spillway. Besides discussing these issues, this paper provides quantitative justification why the floodwater would have to be supplemented with groundwater, if there is to be a real possibility of achieving the set targets.

TI Overweight and obese children: mothers' strategies

ID CHILDHOOD OBESITY; EPIDEMIC
AB Aim. This paper reports a study exploring the strategies a group of mothers of overweight and obese children were using and planned to use in the future to assist their children to achieve a healthy weight.
   Background. Over the past two decades, the prevalence of childhood obesity has grown exponentially to become a major public health concern. Extant literature suggests that childhood obesity is associated with a range of physical, social and psychological effects, including poor self-esteem, depression, social isolation, and cardio-vascular and other morbidity. Parents are known to be important in determining early eating and exercise habits, and their involvement is crucial to achieving positive child health outcomes.
   Methods. An exploratory-descriptive design informed by feminist research principles shaped the study, which was carried out in 2003-2004. Eleven mothers meeting the inclusion criteria took part in in-depth interviews. These were transcribed, and qualitatively analysed.
   Findings. Participants revealed sound understandings of the concept and ramifications of obesity. They had initiated a range of strategies including role modelling, developing opportunities for increased physical activity, reducing the use of junk food, and heightened awareness of how they used food. Participants viewed the problem as a family rather than an individual problem, and aimed many of the interventions at the entire family to avoid targeting the focus child.
   Conclusions. Further research into how childhood obesity is managed within the context of family life is needed. Specifically, additional perspectives on how mothers from various socio-cultural groups address childhood obesity within family life, and longitudinal studies to explore the efficacy and sustainability of family-based lifestyle changes that are made in response to concerns about child weight issues. Additional research to explore the type and nature of family support that can best assist families to achieve sustainable lifestyle improvements is needed.

AB 1. Threat listing of exploited marine species has been controversial because of the scientific uncertainty of extinction risk as well as the social, economic and political costs of management procedures that may be triggered by designation of species as threatened.
   2. We applied three sets of threat criteria to 76 stocks (populations) of 21 exploited marine fish and invertebrate species. Two criteria sets were based on decline rates: World Conservation Union (IUCN A1) and the American Fisheries Society (AFS). The third set of criteria, based on population viability (IUCN E), was assessed using non-parametric simulation and two diffusion approximation methods.
   3. We compared extinction risk outcomes (threatened or not) against the exploitation status of each stock as reported in fish stock assessments (inside or outside safe biological limits). For each combination of threat and exploitation we assessed the rate of hits, misses and false alarms.
   4. Our analyses suggest that decline rate criteria provide risk categorizations consistent with population viability analyses when applied to exploited marine stocks. Nearly a quarter of the fish and invertebrate populations (n = 18) considered met one or more of the threat criteria.
   5. None of the threat metrics produced false alarms, where sustainably exploited stocks were categorized as threatened. The quantitative IUCN E metrics produced higher hit rates than the decline rate metrics (IUCN A1 and AFS) and all of the metrics produced similar miss rates. However, the IUCN E methods could be applied to fewer stocks (12-14) compared with IUCN A1 decline rate and AFS criteria, both of which could be applied all 76 stocks.
   6. Synthesis and applications. Threat criteria provide warnings of population collapse that are consistent with those provided in fisheries stock assessments. Our results suggest that scientists with different backgrounds and objectives should usually be able to agree on the stocks for which the most urgent management action is needed. Moreover, IUCN A1 decline rate metrics may provide useful indicators of population status when the information needed for full fisheries stock assessment is not available.

AB 1. Under the source-sink model, persistence of populations in habitat sinks, where deaths outnumber births, depends on dispersal from high-quality habitat sources, where births outnumber deaths. The persistence of the regional population depends on the proportion of sink relative to source habitat.
   2. Hunting that occurs in some parts of the landscape and not in others can create patches where deaths outnumber births. We tested whether hunting of culpeo foxes Pseudalopex culpaeus, which is patchily distributed in relatively homogeneous habitat in Argentine Patagonia, induces source-sink dynamics.
   3. On Patagonian sheep ranches, culpeos are hunted for fur and to protect sheep, and on cattle ranches hunting is usually banned. We monitored culpeo densities using scent stations and estimated survival, fecundity and dispersal by radio-tracking 44 culpeos and analysing carcasses collected from hunters on two cattle and four sheep ranches between 1989 and 1997.
   4. Survival of juvenile culpeos was lower on hunted than unhunted ranches, mainly as a result of hunting mortality. Reproduction could not compensate for high mortality on hunted ranches. Interruption of hunting led to an increase in juvenile survival, indicating that hunting and natural mortality were not compensatory. We concluded that sheep ranches were sinks because of the high mortality and that sink populations may be maintained by dispersal from cattle ranches.
   5. We used a simulation model to assess implications of changes in the proportion of source and sink areas on population dynamics. The percentage of land on cattle ranches in the study area was 37%. Current hunting pressure on culpeos would not be sustainable if that percentage fell below 30%.
   6. Synthesis and applications. Source-sink dynamics may occur in landscapes where hunting is intense and spatially heterogeneous. Wildlife management traditionally monitors demographic rates to evaluate the sustainability of hunting, but our results suggest that the size and spatial arrangement of areas with and without hunting should be considered as well. In regions where enforcement and monitoring are limited, securing large and regularly distributed source areas for hunted species may be more effective than trying to regulate harvest size.

DE West Africa; semi-arid; livestock; crop; urban; socio-economy
AB Livestock keeping may have an important environmental impact. Therefore, there is a crucial need for understanding where and why livestock is kept in an urban context. In that frame, a survey was carried out in Ouagadougou (Burkina Faso) in 2002. The study documents the socio-economic determinants of urban livestock keeping in a semi-arid environment, its constraints and the underlying driving forces for keeping livestock in the city and the perception of the future by livestock keepers.
   The results show that 26.3% of the households in Ouagadougou are currently keeping livestock, including all major domestic animal species. The main motivation for keeping livestock in an urban setting is its' generation of income. Main identified constraints are animal health problems, feed supply, theft, and manure management. A comparison with crop production highlights that the latter is practised by even poorer urban dwellers compared to pure livestock keepers. Technical, environmental and public health issues have to be resolved to secure sustainable urban development. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This article reports on field experience of unvented cathedralized (UC) attics in several environments in the United States. Traditionally, in some regions of the country, because of high water tables or the risk of flash flooding and lower cost, slab on grade construction is a preferred mode of construction. Mechanical equipment for air conditioning and distribution ducts are usually located in the attic spaces to conserve space. Conventional construction involves providing insulation on the floor of the attic and venting the attic space to the outside. The loss in efficiency in operation of the equipment and through duct leakage is no longer sustainable. Insulating the attic roof itself and blocking of ventilation to the outside transfers the air and thermal energy controls from the boundary with the living space to the plane of the roof. The air distribution systems now fall within conditioned space, which increases their efficiency, durability, and maintainability.
   While design criteria vary for different climatic regions, UC attics can be insulated in various ways and by using different vapor diffusion resistance strategies of the roof assemblies depending on the climate. The field data presented in this article include measured temperature of asphalt shingles, and thermal and moisture conditions of attic spaces and roof sheathing, as well as air leakage rates. This is of interest for determining probable roofing durability. A more complete understanding of the hygrothermal performance of the assemblies was gained through these measurements.

AB Sustainable development (SD) - that is, "Development that meets the needs of current generations without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs and aspirations" - can be pursued in many different ways. Stakeholder relations management (SRM) is one such way, through which corporations are confronted with economic, social, and environmental stakeholder claims. This paper lays the groundwork for an empirical analysis of the question of how far SD can be achieved through SRM. It describes the so-called SD-SRM perspective as a distinctive research approach and shows how it relates to the wider body of stakeholder theory. Next, the concept of SD is operationalized for the microeconomic level with reference to important documents. Based on the ensuing SD framework, it is shown how SD and SRM relate to each other, and how the two concepts relate to other popular concepts such as Corporate Sustainability and Corporate Social Responsibility. The paper concludes that the significance of societal guiding models such as SD and of management approaches like CSR is strongly dependent on their footing in society.

AB In the course of creating immense wealth, manufacturing industry has excessively consumed the resources and energy in the earth, and seriously polluted the environment. To take progress as the sustainable development way, save resource and improve environment, our nation has been advocating to construct the cycle economy and saving-oriented society. Taking the remanufacturing engineering as the representative, the "4R" rule (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle and Remanufacture) is the important measure to get the goal. Remanufacturing engineering is the industrialization of high-tech maintenance of the waste and worn productions, and is one of the most active factors in "4R". The development of high and new technology takes the important effect to promote the remanufacturing engineering.

AB Nowadays, issues on population, environment and resource have become the world's attentive focus. Sustainable development has been widely accepted around the world. As one of the biggest waste generator and resources consumer, manufacturing industry is facing more challenges as well as opportunities. In order to reduce both resource consuming and waste discharging effectively, traditionally manufacturing mode should be improved. Newly emerged creative technologies and strategies, including green design, green manufacturing and cleaner production, are regarded as the radical resolvent for current environment and resource issues and they will be the only way in the future that manufacturing will evolve. In this paper, a serial of research on green design/manufacturing and cleaner product theoretically and practically was presented. These creative technology and strategy will give strong support to 'green' the whole electromechanical designing and manufacturing processes.

AB The volume tendency of in-use and end-of-life computers in China were analyzed; the emerging danger of obsolete computers by incorrect treatment was summarized; the integration disposal technologies based on 3R (recycle, remanufacture and reuse) engineering aiming at monitors, electronic devices, metals, plastics materials, and overall computers were put forward; the economic and social benefits were also analyzed. The results show that the integration disposal process of obsolete computer is an optimum approach to save the resource of electromechanical products. Remanufacturing and disposal 100 thousand obsolete computers per year can create profits about RMB10 million yuan and provide employment for 300 persons. It can be deduced that there are great potential opportunities for the obsolete computers disposal industry containing recycle, remanufacture and reuse engineering.

ID CORROSION BEHAVIOR
AB Based on the advanced integrated technology of materials preparation and formation, a new pattern Zn- Al-Mg-RE anti-corrosion coating for steel structure sustainable design was manufactured by cored wires and high velocity arc spraying (HVAS) technologies. The developments of thermally sprayed coatings for steel structure protection were described. Based on Al, Zn, Zn-Al and Zn-Al-Mg coatings, the anti-corrosion properties of new-pattern Zn-Al-Mg-RE coating were evaluated through electrochemical methods including electrochemical polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) coupled with SEM and XRD. The models of Zn-Al-Mg-RE coating undergoing corrosion with the initial pinhole defect and the latter with accelerated products were also discussed. The results show that Zn-Al-Mg-RE coating exhibites excellent corrosion resistance for long-term immersion, which is helpful for the sustainable design of steel structure in aggressive corrosion conditions. And the corrosion products seem to possess certain self-sealing function.

AB The Catalytic Reaction Engineering toward Green Chemical Processes Project was undertaken between 2001 and 2003, funded under the Scientific Research in Priority Areas Program of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan. The representative of the project is Prof. Hattori of Nagoya University. This research project was aimed at establishing the hybrid field of catalytic reaction engineering to bridge the large gap between nano-scale catalytic chemistry and macroscopic chemical reaction engineering as an essential discipline for the realization of a sustainable society. Research was divided into three areas; the development of reaction fields using structured catalysts, the control of catalytic functions using reaction fields, and the design of catalytic reaction fields for achieving "green" chemical processes. Each of these research fields was further divided into three subgroups. Importantly, each division worked together toward achieving the overall result of catalytic reaction engineering. This project produced many useful and progressive results, as presented at the 10th Asian Pacific Confederation of Chemical Engineering (APCChE 2004).

AB Acute, uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most commonly encountered bacterial infections and management has been made more complicated in the last decade due to the trend toward increasing antimicrobial resistance to ampicillin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX). Fluoroquinolones are suggested as alternative antimicrobials for the treatment of UTIs in communities for which TMP/SMX resistance is >= 10%. The mutant-prevention concentration (MPC) is a novel susceptibility parameter designed to minimize the selection of first-step resistant mutants present in large, >= 10(10) CFU/mL, heterogeneous bacterial populations and is a distinct measurement from minimum inhibitory concentration testing. We measured MPC results for 80 enteric Gram-negative and 20 Pseudomonas aeruginosa urinary isolates against ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and garenoxacin. Ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and garenoxacin MPC results for Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa respectively were 0.5, 1, 1, 1 and 4 mg/L; 1, 2, 4, 2 and 16 mg/L; 1, 8, >8, 4 and >= 32 mg/L. By comparison, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)(90) results for the Enterobacteriaceae organisms ranged from <= 0.06-4 mg/L for the three drugs and 1-4 mg/L against P. aeruginosa. Similarly, MBC90 results ranged from <= 0.06-4 mg/L and 2-8 mg/L respectively. For ciprofloxacin against E.coli, E. cloacae and K. pneumoniae and for levofloxacin against E.coli, C. freundii and K. pneumoniae, MPC results were below susceptible breakpoints and within clinically achievable and sustainable drug concentrations for >24 hours of the dosing interval against. For garenoxacin, urine drug concentrations are expected to be in excess of MPC results for the entire length of the dosing interval for E.coli. Application of MPCs to fluoroquinolones and management of UTIs represents a situation where high levels of in vitro activity, based on low MICs, is reflected in correspondingly low MPC values for most of the organisms tested. Incorporation of MPC strategies into current fluoroquinolone dosing in UTI represents a realistic approach for preventing the further selection of resistant organisms associated with UTIs.

ID FALLS; RISK
AB Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the impact, in a regional setting, of a multi-strategic partnership approach for reducing benzodiazepine use in the management of insomnia, as recommended in Australia's National Policy on Quality Use of Medicines.
   Method: The setting was a rural region of South Australia, covering approximately 2000 km(2), with a population of over 20 000. The study involved participatory action research, with qualitative and quantitative evaluations. The intervention involved a multi-strategic approach, including provision of treatment guidelines, provision of consumer information, a local media campaign and education and training of health professionals. The quantitative evaluation involved a single region before/after study with 2 years of follow-up using pharmacy-based dispensing data for benzodiazepines and antidepressants, gathered for the months of November to April in 1998/99 ('before' period) through to 2000/01 ('after' period). The data were analysed using non-parametric statistics.
   Results: There was a 19% reduction in benzodiazepine dispensing 2 years after the intervention compared with a 6% reduction nationally. Dispensing of antidepressants increased by 33%, compared with a 28% increase nationally.
   Conclusion: It was concluded that the multi-strategic approach to the management of sleep disorders proved successful in promoting the use of non-drug alternatives, achieving sustained reduction in benzodiazepine consumption in a rural community, without therapeutic substitution of antidepressants.
   Implications: The study demonstrated that a sustainable reduction in prescribing of benzodiazepines can be achieved through the implementation of a multi-strategic approach involving local consumers, health professionals, a Division of General Practice, a government department, aged-care facilities and the local media.

AB This article elaborates the factors that have led to the emergence of the concept of learning objects as the predominant model for digital learning materials, examining the problems that they address. It suggests that while there do appear to be real benefits, for a learning object model to be successful there needs to be a thriving learning object economy. In turn, this demands a wide group of authors, drawn from the teaching community, and for these to participate there is an urgent requirement for tools that permit the easy creation and description of learning materials in learning objects format; but more importantly, support for sustainable communities of authors of digital learning materials.

TI Sustainable growth and the environmental Kuznets curve
SO JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC DYNAMICS & CONTROL
LA English
DT Article
DE economic growth; pollution
ID ECONOMIC-GROWTH; ENDOGENOUS GROWTH; POLLUTION; MODEL; EMISSIONS; QUALITY
AB This paper develops an endogenous growth model with pollution and both human and physical capital. Human capital is produced cleanly and physical capital can be used for pollution control. Economic growth is sustainable. In the long run it is optimal for human capital to grow more rapidly than physical capital, output, and consumption, while pollution declines for realistic parameter values. Our results differ sharply from Stokey's result for an AK technology that sustained economic growth is not optimal. The model can generate an environmental Kuznets curve. A pollution tax or a voucher system can implement the Pareto efficiency solution. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   thermotherapy and dilatation with double-balloon catheter
SO JOURNAL OF ENDOUROLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID DOUBLE-BLIND; RESECTION; DILATION; MULTICENTER; URETHRA; HUMANS; TURP
AB Purpose: To improve the outcome of transurethral microwave thermotherapy (TUMT) for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia, we combined TUMT and balloon dilatation (BD) with a double-balloon catheter and investigated its effects.
   Patients and Methods: For a short-term trial, 40 patients were divided randomly into two groups: 20 patients received TUMT alone, and the other 20 received TUMT followed by BD. The degrees of symptoms were graded according to the International Prostate Symptom Score and Quality of Life score, and the peak urinary flow rate was measured before and 10 weeks after treatment. A historic control study of 527 patients was also performed to evaluate the long-term re-treatment rate: 98 of the patients received TUMT alone, and the other 429 patients received TUMT followed by BD.
   Results: The symptom scores improved significantly in both groups. The peak uroflow rate was significantly increased in the group who received TUMT followed by BD (P < 0.01), whereas the change was not significant in the TUMT-alone group. Significant sustainability of long-term effects was more evident in patients receiving TUMT plus BD than in the TUMT-alone group, as judged by the higher proportion of BD-treated patients who required no further treatment during the 5-year study period in comparison with patients who received TUMT alone (66.3% v 28.6%, respectively; P < 0.001).
   Conclusions: Combined TUMT and BD achieves sufficient subjective and objective improvement and a sustainable long-term effect. We consider this combination technique to be useful for the treatment of prostatic hyperplasia.

TI Water availability and usage on the New Mexico/Mexico border
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
AB New Mexico, one of four states on the U.S./Mexico border, is faced with a pressing concern-lack of water. Since the region is either arid or semiarid, it is chronically short of continually available surface-water resources. Groundwater resources are used beyond their capacity to be naturally recharged, and most surface-water resources are used to the maximum. The quality of groundwater varies widely. As a result of nonpoint- and point-source contamination, as well as natural occurrence, water in some areas is too salty or has high levels of natural uranium, fluoride, or arsenic. To date, the New Mexico Environment Department (NMED) has recognized 1,400 cases of groundwater contamination, and 1,907 water supply wells have been affected (NMED, 2001a). Of approximately 4,000 miles of continuously flowing rivers and streams in New Mexico, 92 percent,are affected by nonpoint sources of pollution (NMED, 2001b). Numerous critical water issues exist along the New Mexico/Mexico border as a result of the impending critical issue of water availability, usage, and quality, as well as the fast-growing population. Related public health problems along the New Mexico/Mexico border are indicative of the need for a holistic, concrete, and sustainable solution to meet water demands in New Mexico. In order to accomplish the goals and objectives of Border XXI, Healthy People 2010, and Healthy Border 2010, a comprehensive statewide water management plan is needed.

TI Social interactions and resource ownership in two private protected
   areas of Paraguay
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE Paraguay; nature reserves; participation; conflict; private conservation
ID PARTICIPATION; CONSERVATION; COUNTRIES; POVERTY; PROGRAM
AB This paper describes the results of field research to dissect how social interactions differ between two reserves in Paraguay having very different styles of governance. The two reserves were Mbaracayu Natural Forest Reserve (Reserva Natural del Bosque de Mbaracayti, RNBM) and San Rafael Managed Resource Reserve (Reserva de Recursos Manejados San Rafael, RRMSR). RNBM is a private reserve owned by a non-governmental organisation. while RRNISR is a publicly-managed reserve, albeit with a substantial degree of private land ownership. Both reserves are intended to protect Atlantic Forest, one of the five world biodiversity 'hotspots', and also one of the most highly threatened. Each reserve and its buffer zone comprises a set of stakeholders, including indigenous communities and farmers, and the paper explores the interactions between these and the management regime. Indeed, while the management regimes of the two reserves are different, one being highly top-down (RNBM) and the other more socially inclusive (RRMSR), the issues that they have to deal with are much the same. However, while both management regimes will readily acknowledge the need to address poverty, inequality appears to be a far more sensitive issue. Whereas this may be expected for the privately-owned RNBM it is perhaps more surprising in RRNISR even when allowing for the fact that much of the land in the latter is in private hands. It is argued that the origins of this sensitivity rest within the broader features of Paraguayan society, and the prevalence of private land ownership. Yet ironically, it is the inequality in land ownership that is perhaps the most significant threat to conservation in both reserves. Therefore, while reserve-level analyses can provide some insight into the driving forces at play in the interaction between conservation and sustainable management, larger scales may be necessary to gain a fuller appreciation of the dynamics operating at site level. Even in a society with a history of centralised control these dynamics may be surprising. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   MANIPULATION; SYSTEMS
AB Extensive crop damage due to rodents, predominantly the black rat (Rattus rattus) is a major concern to both the Hawaiian and Australian macadamia industries. Within Australian systems, White et al. (1997) indicated the importance of adjacent non-crop habitats in the damage process with damage being directly related to the size and temporal stability of these habitats. It was also suggested that the current estimates of crop loss might be underestimates as R. rattus may remove nuts into adjacent non-crop habitats, however, the economic significance of nut removal was not investigated.
   This study has determined that the crop loss due to nut removal is equivalent to the crop loss due to in-crop feeding within the first row of the orchard, with nuts being removed and consumed under the cover provided by weedy adjacent habitats. Previous studies (White et al., 1997; Horskins et al., 1998; White et al., 1998) investigating the impact of rodents on crop damage have ignored the nut removal component of the damage process and hence rodents have a far greater impact on the Australian macadamia industry than previously suggested.
   This study also indicates that the cost-benefit of habitat manipulation as a rodent management strategy is much greater than that suggested by Horskins and Wilson (1999). Habitat manipulation is not only a cost-effective mean, of damage control but is also sustainable, having none of the potentially adverse public health and environmental effects of continual rodenticide use.

ID ECOLOGICAL SUCCESSION; DYNAMICS
AB The monoculture strategy of forest management, where the same tree species (e.g., Picea abies) is cultivated in a number of successive planting-growing-felling cycles, is generally considered to be economically efficient, yet not sustainable as it reduces biodiversity in the forest. The sound alternative suggests a long-term strategy of forest management in which different forest types rotate either with planting after clear cutting, or by natural forest succession, yet the commercial output remains dubious. We suggest an approach to formalization and modelling forest dynamics in the long-term by means of Markov chains, the monoculture strategy resulting in an absorbing chain and the rotation one in a regular chain, The approach is illustrated with a case study of Russkii Les, a managed forest located in the Moscow Region, Russia, and the nearby forest reserve having been used as a data source for undisturbed forest dynamics. Starting with conceptual schemes of transitions among certain forest types (states of the chain) in the monoculture and rotation cases, we estimated the transition probabilities by an original method based on average duration of the corresponding states and on the likelihood of alternative transitions from a state into the next one. Formal analysis of the regular chain reveals an opportunity to achieve particular management objectives within the rotation strategy, in particular, to get the distribution of forest types in accordance with an adopted hierarchy of their commercial values, i.e. more valuable types have greater shares.

ID ANALYTIC HIERARCHY PROCESS; MANAGEMENT
AB In determining the importance of criteria in the management of wetlands, two key issues arise: that is whether they should be conserved for environmental benefits, or whether they should be used for development activities. This is indeed the conflict faced in many natural resource management problems. This paper considers the development of stakeholder preferences in a region in Sri Lanka for representative criteria based on defined objectives for wetland management. Data were obtained spatially from a paired comparison based survey using the analytic hierarchy process to investigate the importance attached to the criteria by stakeholders who live and work in the wetland region. Distinct groups showing different concerns towards importance of objectives are shown to exist over the whole area and spatially. However, the consensus view of favouring conservation of the environment is indicated by 80% of the sample. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper uses the concept of sustainable development to examine the utilisation of wildlife resources at Moremi Game Reserve (MGR) and Khwai community area (NG 18/19) in the Okavango Delta, Botswana. Using both secondary and primary data sources, results show that the establishment of MGR in 1963 led to the displacement of Khwai residents from their land; affected Basarwa's hunting and gathering economy; marked the beginning of resource conflicts between Khwai residents and wildlife managers; and, led to the development of negative attitudes of Khwai residents towards wildlife conservation. Since the late 1980s, a predominately foreign owned tourism industry developed in and around MGR, however, Khwai residents derive insignificant benefits from it and hence resource conflicts increased. In an attempt to address problems of resource conflicts and promote sustainable wildlife utilisation, the Botswana Government adopted the Community-Based Natural Resource Management (CBNRM) programme, which started operating at Khwai village in 2000. The CBNRM programme promotes local participation in natural resource management and rural development through tourism. It is beginning to have benefits to Khwai residents such as income generation, employment opportunities and local participation in wildlife management. These benefits from CBNRM are thus having an impact in the development of positive attitudes of Khwai residents towards wildlife conservation and tourism development. This paper argues that if extended to MGR, CBNRM has the potential of minimising wildlife conflicts between Khwai residents and the wildlife-tourism sectors. This approach may in the process promote the sustainable wildlife use in and around MGR. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB How do international processes, actors and institutions contribute to domestic policy change and cross-national policy convergence? Scholars in the fields of international relations and comparative politics have identified a wide array of convergence mechanisms operating at the international or transnational level. In order to categorize this wide array of possible causes of policy convergence, we propose a typology of three broad classes of mechanisms: (1) the co-operative harmonization of domestic practices by means of international legal agreements or supranational law; (2) the coercive imposition of political practices by means of economic, political or even military threat, intervention or conditionality; and (3) the interdependent but uncoordinated diffusion of practices by means of cross-national imitation, emulation or learning. We illustrate and substantiate this claim through the empirical analysis of the international spread of three different kinds of policy innovation: national environmental policy plans and sustainable development strategies, environmental ministries and agencies, and feed-in tariffs and quotas for the promotion of renewable electricity.

TI Design of a supply chain network for pea-based novel protein foods
SO JOURNAL OF FOOD ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
DE novel protein foods; supply chains; optimisation
ID MODELS
AB This paper presents an operations research technique that call be used for supply chain design and applies it to create a supply network with a goal to manufacture a pea-based NPF as cheaply as possible. The current food production and consumption pattern has a strong impact on the environment and resources and is not sustainable. Meat production in particular is not appealing from an environmental point of view, because of the inefficient conversion of protein in the feed into protein in the slaughtered animal. Novel protein foods (NPFs) are non-meat protein ingredients that are designed to replace meat-based ingredients in meals. The non-meat protein products presently available do not meet the expectations of most consumers and cannot be considered as realistic alternatives to meat (http://www.profetas.nl). They are niche products and are expensive when compared to pork. The prospects for replacing meat-derived ingredients by NPFs are more promising. The partial shift from an animal based diet to a plant, specifically pea-based diet may be feasible only if the price of these products decreases.
   A supply chain for NPFs can be divided into three major links: primary production (growing and harvesting), ingredient preparation (milling and concentration of pea protein) and product processing (manufacture of the NPF). The pea-based product is designed for the Dutch market. The peas are sourced from several locations around the world such as Canada, Ukraine, France and the Netherlands and are transported by sea, rail, road or barge. This paper presents a study on the optimisation of the supply network for NPFs in the Netherlands using linear programming. It focuses on finding the lowest cost at which NPFs can be manufactured for a specific market demand; while deciding the location of primary production, ingredient processing and product production areas and modes of transportation by minimising the sum of production and transportation costs.

TI Controls and reference conditions in forestry: The role of old-growth
   and retrospective studies
SO JOURNAL OF FORESTRY
LA English
DT Article
DE Minnesota; northern hardwoods; spruce-fir-birch
AB Forest stands that experience only natural disturbance can serve as controls to provide a scientific basis for comparison with harvested forests to help determine when harvesting has been done in a sustainable manner. Primary stands can serve as references for silvicultural trials that attempt to mimic the primary forest structural attributes on shorter time scales of a few decades. At the landscape scale, retrospective techniques can be used to examine proportion and variation in proportion of stands among structural and successional stages expected under the natural disturbance regime. These analyses are referred to as range of natural variation and serve as landscape-scale reference conditions for comparison with the managed forest landscape.

   professional virtual communities; virtual breeding environments
AB Collaborative networks manifest in a large variety of forms, including virtual organizations, virtual enterprises, dynamic supply chains, professional virtual communities, collaborative virtual laboratories, etc. A large body of empiric knowledge related to collaborative networks is already available, but there is an urgent need to consolidate this knowledge and build the foundations for a more sustainable development of this area. The establishment of a scientific discipline for collaborative networks is a strong instrument in achieving this purpose. In this article the main characteristics of a "discipline" are analyzed in the context of collaborative networks, showing that the pre-conditions necessary for building this new discipline are available.

AB This study provides a theoretical framework illustrating how the internal social structure of the organization can mediate the relationship between high-performance work systems (HPWS) and organizational performance. HPWS positively influence the internal social structure by facilitating bridging network ties, generalized norms of reciprocity, shared mental models, role making, and organizational citizenship behavior. Although HPWS are conceptualized as a system of human resource (HR) practices, each category of HR practices has a differential relationship with the mediating variables. HPWS lead to (a) financial performance via administrative efficiency and (b) sustainable performance via flexibility arising from the coordination and exploitation of knowledge resources.

AB Conducting polyester PET and polyamide PA- 6 fibre and fabrics were prepared by in- situ chemical oxidative polymerisation using super critical fluid assisted process. The fibre materials and cloths produced were characterized by means of FTIR, WAXD, SEM, and DSC and two- probe resistivity. The samples were studied also by means of washing them several times. Homogeneous treated fibre materials with sustainable properties were produced. Melt spun fibre material of inherently conducting polymer blends have been reported earlier. Reasonable mechanical and electrical properties ( resistance of 10(5)...10(7) Omega/cm) are typical for blend of polypropylene and polyaniline. With bi- component extrusion technology the fibre as good as 10(3)...10(5) Omega/cm is reachable. (c) 2005 Springer Science+ Business Media, Inc.

AB Rhizobacteria are actively sought for the substitution of chemical fertilizers and pathogen control agents in environment-friendly sustainable agriculture. To be successfully commercialized in the current Korean market as agriculture biomaterials, microbial agents should exhibit both properties of plant growth promotion and pathogen control. That is, the organism must be a phytostimulator as well as a biocontrol agent. These criteria and the survival rate of a rhizobacterium, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens 7079, in the soil system were investigated to evaluate the suitability for future commercialization. B. amyloliquefaciens 7079-treated seedlings showed 22.8% maximum increase in leaf-length growth, compared with water-treated controls, showing the phytostimulating property. The disease suppression rates of Phytophthora-blight of peppers and Fusarium-wilt of tomatoes by B. amyloliquefaciens 7079 were 1.5 and 2.2 times better, respectively, than by three popular chemical fungicides in actual agricultural practices to control the respective pathogens. Survival of B. amyloliquefaciens 7079 on the rhizoplane and in the rhizosphere was favorable up to 50 days in the soil system employed. These positive properties show that B. amyloliquefaciens 7079 is likely to be a suitable candidate for commercialization to market as agricultural biomaterials.

AB Supplies of marine fish oils (FO) are limited, and sustainable production in aquaculture dictates that alternatives that do not compromise fish health and product quality, such as vegetable oils, must be found. Nutrigenomics will increase our understanding of how nutrition influences metabolic pathways and homeostatic control, and may be used to measure and validate subtle changes in organ-specific, metabolic gene expression signatures. We compared 2 groups of Atlantic salmon fed diets containing 100% FO or 75% rapeseed oil (RO) for 42 wk. A small-scale cDNA microarray was constructed to screen for changes in the expression of lipid metabolism genes in the liver resulting from this partial substitution of RO for FO. Delta 5 fatty acid desaturase gene expression was significantly greater in fish fed 75% RO than in fish fed the control diet; this was confirmed by quantitative real time PCR analysis. In addition, several genes, among these mitochondrial proteins, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, as well as other transcription factors, coactivators, and signal transducers, showed significant differential regulation. This partially validated microarray may be used for further gene expression profiling using other dietary comparisons, and for further characterization of selected genes.

SO JOURNAL OF PROFESSIONAL ISSUES IN ENGINEERING EDUCATION AND PRACTICE
LA English

ID CURRENT PHILOSOPHY; CIVIL ENGINEER; SUSTAINABILITY; ETHICS; ISSUES
AB This paper is concerned with the potential of accountability to improve the performance of public urban services. A number of assumptions are made in the literature relating to accountability; these concern the necessity of multiple strategies of accountability, information symmetries, sanctions, trust, homogeneous service users, community-level answerability, incentives, self-regarding behavior, and for users' voice to be heard in service delivery. It is the purpose of this paper to reconsider these theoretical propositions for the functioning of accountability in light of practical experience from the United Kingdom, South Africa, Bangladesh, and South Korea. Each of these case studies was selected to illustrate a different form of accountability. The forms of accountability investigated in this research are professional, political, user, and managerial accountabilities. An assessment is made of whether accountability is demonstrated in these case studies in the way predicted by the literature. The empirical data demonstrate that factors like multiple strategies and information/ resource symmetries are critical to accountability but that there is only partial evidence to support the need for sanctions, trust, incentives, self-interest, and user voice for effective service delivery. The research indicates the need for greater emphasis on the operation and maintenance of urban services and direct accountability to service users. However the assumption that service users are homogeneous is disputed. This paper concludes with a review of the practical implications of strengthening accountability as a means to improve the performance of urban services.

AB This article examines the interrelations between establishment of territorial quality certification systems (Protected Designations of Origin or PDOs), diffusion of innovations through local agro-food chains, and the role of the institutions overseeing geographical designations. Empirical analysis is applied to olive oil PDOs in Spain and entails a detailed case study of the "Sierra Magina" PDO in Andalusia. Making use of the neoinstitutional concept of 'organised proximity'-and focussing specifically on the problematic of organizational quality-the article assesses characteristics that support the competitive positions of local certified-product production systems In particular, the authors find that collective organisation and coordination between PDO agents who are locally responsible for quality assurance and protection can enhance local competitiveness Three hypotheses are confirmed. First, PDO labels can, through the action of PDO regulators, become quality assurance systems for distributors. Second, PDO Regulatory Boards can enhance and coordinate local inter-professional activities, particularly with respect to the diffusion of quality-enhancing innovations and knowledge Third, the study indicates that local certified-product systems are starting to incorporate quality attributes linked to the environment and sustainable development, although much remains to be accomplished in this regard (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Most data involving organizations are hierarchical in nature and often contain variables measured at multiple levels of analysis. Hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) is a relatively new and innovative statistical method that organizational scientists have used to alleviate some common problems associated with multilevel data, thus advancing our understanding of organizations. This article presents a broad overview of HLM's logic through an empirical analysis and outlines how its use can strengthen sport management research. For illustration purposes, we use both HLM and the traditional linear regression model to analyze how organizational and individual factors in Major League Baseball impact individual players' salaries. A key implication is that, depending on the method, parameter estimates differ because of the multilevel data structure and, thus, findings differ. We explain these differences and conclude by presenting theoretical discussions from strategic management and consumer behavior to provide a potential research agenda for sport management scholars.

ID CLIMATE-CHANGE; VULNERABILITY; RESOURCES
AB To evaluate the long term sustainability of water withdrawals in the United States, a county level analysis of the availability of renewable water resources was conducted, and the magnitudes of human withdrawals from surface water and ground water sources and the stored water requirements during the warmest months of the year were evaluated. Estimates of growth in population and electricity generation were then used to estimate the change in withdrawals assuming that the rates of water use either remain at their current levels (the business as usual scenario) or that they exhibit improvements in efficiency at the same rate as observed over 1975 to 1995 (the improved efficiency scenario). The estimates show several areas, notably the Southwest and major metropolitan areas throughout the United States, as being likely to have significant new storage requirements with the business-as-usual scenario, under the condition of average water availability. These new requirements could be substantially eliminated under the improved efficiency scenario, thus indicating the importance of water use efficiency in meeting future requirements. The national assessment identified regions of potential water sustainability concern; these regions can be the subject of more targeted data collection and analyses in the future.

TI Cultivaral difference in growth sustainability of rice species grown in
   low nitrogen-input condition
SO JOURNAL OF THE FACULTY OF AGRICULTURE KYUSHU UNIVERSITY
LA English
DT Article
ID PHOTOSYNTHETIC ACTIVITY; SENESCENCE; LEAF
AB The experimental materials used here were 12 rice cultivars released and grown in the past one century in the southern area of Japan and two African cultivars. With plants water-cultured under standard and low nitrogen applications, their dry matter weight, leaf area and net assimilation rate (NAR), rubisco content and chlorophyll content in leaves were investigated. Results obtained were as follows: By reducing the nitrogen concentration of culture-solution to 10% of the standard, the average plant dry matter weight and leaf area of the 14 cultivars were decreased to 25% and 20%, respectively. To evaluate the growth sustainability of cultivars grown under the low nitrogen application, the sustainability index (SIL) was used here. SIL of dry matter weight (SIL-DM), leaf area (SIL-LA) and NAR (SIL-NAR) were significantly different among cultivars. For these three parameters, large values were found in Koshilukari, one of the high quality cultivars widely grown in Japan today, and the small,ones,were observed in old, traditional cultivars, such as Asahi and Shinriki, and in G174 (O. glaberrima). A significant cultivaral difference in response to nitrogen application was also found in the rubisco and chlorophyll contents and their SILs.

DT Article
AB The general idea of the study is to address and explain the current process of establishing new economic relations in forestry-in-transition and assess opportunities for its sustainable development mainly by historical and political analyses approach. The scientific value of the study derives from the elaboration of multidisciplinary knowledge and the enhancement of practical applicability in a transitional economy of the concept of sustainable forestry development. Taking the forest sector of the Czech Republic as an example, the study draws on the state of affairs in forestry that is developing under changing economic conditions, examining failures and new incentives in economic and institutional reforms. The central objective of the study is to determine the appropriate forest policies and economic incentives to improve future output from Czech forestry, while making the sector economically efficient, socially acceptable and environmentally friendly. The way of the forest sector towards sustainable development is explored by analyzing the following: economics of forest use; contribution of forestry to country's economy; external trade and market in forest product; and issues affecting new forest owners, especially problems rising from the political and economic transition, and accession to the European Union.

TI Effectiveness of environmental restoration induced by various trials for
   preventing desertification in Horqin arid land, China - Construction of
   pilot villages based on economical and ecological sustainability (Part
   3)
SO JOURNAL OF THE FACULTY OF AGRICULTURE KYUSHU UNIVERSITY
LA English
DT Article
AB The basic idea for constructing the new agricultural system in the pilot village is to establish the economic sustainability with keeping the diversified agriculture. Farmers grow main products such as cereal crops, woods, fruits, vegetables and livestock. I All the residues are used for producing compost and methane gas by the individual farmers with recycling system. Newly stabilized sand dune is not only effective for preventing sand drift but also effective for producing notorious grass for livestock. With producing grasses, repeatedly, the soil physical and chemical properties are expected to be improved steadily. Wind shelter forests are effective for protecting agricultural area from strong wind and sand attack. Moreover these are effective for supplying woods and fuels, and litters are used for soil improvement. The long span land rental system is effective to improve the sustainable development of agriculture at the desert area in Naiman.

TI The potential for cooperative management of elasmobranchs and offshore
   renewable energy development in UK waters
SO JOURNAL OF THE MARINE BIOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION OF THE UNITED KINGDOM
LA English
DT Article
ID NORTH-SEA; HISTORY; FOOD
AB The UK government's strategy for reducing greenhouse gas emissions to meet carbon mitigation obligations and the wider aims on sustainable development has provided the impetus for a rapid growth in activity associated with offshore renewable energy, particularly offshore wind farms. Recently, consents for offshore renewable energy development (ORED) were approved in three strategic areas-the Outer Thames estuary, the Greater Wash and the eastern Irish Sea. The scale of the planned developments means that each will have a large environmental footprint and multiple ORED will have a cumulative effect on the environment. Here we discuss current understanding of ORED construction, operation and decommissioning with regard to the potential interaction with elasmobranchs because of the worrying status of elasmobranch populations within nthe UK coastal zone. Based on the likely interactions between elasmobranchs and ORED a framework is proposed which aims to promote cooperative initiatives between elasmobranch conservation management and the offshore renewables industry.

ID MANAGEMENT; RESOURCES
AB The selection of a method for policy assessment in a particular industry varies according to the characteristics of the issues involved. In the natural gas industry, each component has its own speci. c features and, when analysed as a single whole, a synthesized modelling approach may turn appropriate. This paper shows that in some instances, the integration of modelling methodologies might be of great value for understanding, evaluating and formulating energy policy. Here we address methodological issues that have been considered for the assessment of policy options in the natural gas industry in Colombia. We focus on both modelling and policy, specifically with respect to industry sustainability, and also on environmental impacts.

SO JOURNAL OF UROLOGY

AB Purpose: We present long-term observations on photoselective vaporization of the prostate in a prospectively studied cohort of men with obstructive benign prostatic hyperplasia.
   Materials and Methods: Obstructive benign prostatic hyperplasia in 94 men was treated with transurethral near contact vaporization with potassium-titanyl-phosphate laser with the patient under general or spinal anesthesia. Baseline characteristics, perioperative data, postoperative outcomes and adverse events were recorded.
   Results: Mean prostate volume was 45 ml (range 13 to 136). Mean lasing time was 47 minutes (range 10 to 99), and there was minimal blood loss and no evidence of fluid absorption. All 94 men were outpatients and all but 1 became catheter-free in less than 24 hours. Baseline mean American Urological Association symptom index score was 22, quality of life score 4.5, peak urinary flow rate 7.8 ml per second and post-void residual urine volume 197 ml. After surgery percentage changes from baseline in mean values of these parameters, reflecting significant (p < 0.0001) improvement at 1, 2, 3 and 5 years, ranged from 83% to 88%, 86% to 90%, 170% to 252% and 76% to 89%, respectively. Complications were mild, and included transient dysuria (6%), delayed hematuria (3%), bladder neck contracture (2%) and 2-day retention (1%). No patient had incontinence or newly developed impotence, but up to 26% of the sexually active men experienced retrograde ejaculation. Postoperatively, low stage prostate cancer was detected in 5% of the patients.
   Conclusions: Despite limitations our long-term experience and the literature suggest that significant improvements in symptomatic and urodynamic outcomes of photoselective vaporization of the prostate are achievable and sustainable.

AB Despite an increasing interest in more sustainable forms of land management, few analyses have examined whether 'local' or alternative' food supply systems are sustainable in environmental, economic and social terms. Using SUSTAIN's 'sustainable food' criteria, this paper analyses the sustainability of a number of 'speciality' food supply chains operated by small rural enterprises in the Scottish/English borders. Results indicate that, in the main, the case study businesses are not particularly sustainable; instead, driven by a strong economic imperative, they often have to 'dip' into various 'links' associated with more conventional (commodity-based) food supply chains. The paper concludes by warning against the tendency to conflate terms such as 'local', 'alternative', 'speciality' and 'sustainable'. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Landholdings and land parcels in South Asia are undergoing fragmentation, thereby accelerating the pace of their degradation and constraining agricultural development. Based on experiences gained in the region and elsewhere, this paper finds the fragmentation of small landholdings and tiny land parcels detrimental to land conservation and economic gain, thereby discouraging farmers from adoption of agricultural innovations. Primarily induced by the dependency of the major proportion of ever growing population on agriculture, the process of land fragmentation has been reinforced by the law of inheritance of paternal property, lack of progressive tax on inherited land, heterogeneous land quality and an underdeveloped land market. South Asian countries have had adopted policies and legal measures for facilitating land consolidation. However, desirable results were not achieved, as such interventions could not address structural causes of the problem. Broad policy and legal measures have been outlined for facilitating land consolidation in a sustainable way. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

DT Article
AB Mien members of an email discussion group for Spanish medical translators decided to start a journal for their community, they could not foresee the huge, immediate success the publication was to achieve. All issues of the quarterly journal Panace@ are published online with open access from the day of publication. There are no submittal fees for authors, subscription fees for members of the parent organization, or access fees for users. Here we report how the journal got started and what sustains it. Although questions of long-term sustainability remain unresolved, the system used to start Panace@ may be worth considering for other small organizations with limited access to institutional or private sources of funding.

AB The distribution and abundance of harbor seals (Phoca vitulina richardii) in Oregon were monitored from 1977 to 2003 by aerial photographic surveys. Harbor seals on shore were counted each year during the reproductive period. Mean annual counts of non-pups (adults and subadults) were used as an index of population size and the trend in the counts was modeled using exponential (density-independent) and generalized logistic (density-dependent) growth models. Models were fit using maximum likelihood and evaluated using Akaike's Information Criterion. The population dynamics of harbor seals in Oregon were best described by the generalized logistic model. The population grew following protection under the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 until stabilizing in the early 1990s. The estimated absolute abundance of harbor seals (all age classes) during the 2002 reproductive period was 10087 individuals (95% confidence interval was 8445-12046 individuals). The current predicted population size for harbor seals in Oregon is above its estimated maximum net productivity level and hence within its optimum sustainable population range. We speculate that recent increases in ocean productivity in the eastern Pacific Ocean may lead to an increase in carrying capacity and renewed growth in Oregon's harbor seal population.

AB Reef-building corals are threatened worldwide by mass-scale coral bleaching episodes that are pronounced in high sea surface temperature (SST) conditions. Although water-flow has been suggested to be a mitigating factor for bleaching, long-term effects of flow-mediated bleaching suppression are as yet not fully understood. In order to investigate flow effects, we monitored the corals Pocillopora damicornis and Stylophora pistillata grown for 20 months in experimental outdoor flumes with the flow rates of 20 cm s(-1) (flow) and < 3 cm s(-1) (still). Although bleaching was observed under high SST conditions, both species showed a shorter period or entirely no visible bleaching under the flow conditions. Better colony growth was found in the flow conditions whereas significant growth suppression and higher mortality were observed in still conditions. We conclude that water-flow is an essential environmental factor for the corals P. damicornis and S. pistillata, especially under high SST conditions. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Medical education and training: responding to community needs

   public health approach; research and training
AB At its inception in 1987, the Aga Khan University introduced the idea of community-based medical education in Pakistan, at a time when this model was being introduced and adapted internationally. Human resource development has been a major objective in the Department of community Health Sciences (CHS). CHS has contributed to developing a medical curriculum that addresses the health needs of the community at large. This paper narrates the department's experience in working directly with under-served communities, leading to the development of specialized courses and degree programs. CHS emphasizes operational research and development of managerial skills among front-line public health professionals, in both the public and private sectors. Training is provided by people from diverse backgrounds, such as public health, community development, social sciences, law, epidemiology, economy, biostatistics, demography, theater, and film. The lessons we have learned show that the mode of training depends on the overall objectives of the program, the clients and the setting. However, in the spirit of the participatory approach, the recipients of the training must be involved during all stages so as to ensure the sustainability of the training program. Training must focus oil the communities at the grass roots level or community based organizations, where the communties identify their own capacity and needs. Wide dissemination of training materials, courses and manuals is also useful to replicate successful experience.

AB Arsenic and fluoride in groundwater from Quaternary loess deposits in Argentina pose major health concerns. Common sources for arsenic and fluoride have been suggested but the processes of mobilization are disputed, and distributions in groundwater are largely unresolved at a sample density >1/50 km(2). At Los Pereyras in Tucuman Province, northern Argentina, we have evaluated distributions and hydrochemical associations of arsenic and fluoride with a sample density of 0.75 per km(2) over an area of 75 km(2), to a depth of 230 m. Groundwater in the loess is oxic and alkaline. Fluoride is restricted to the upper 20 m of the Quaternary loess, where it reaches 8.3 mg/l. Arsenic has a vertical layering consistent with that of fluoride, ranging from 20 to 760 mu g/l in the upper 20 m and 58-163 mu g/l below this. There are two sources of arsenic, one unrelated to the fluoride source. Positive correlations between arsenic and fluoride with pH, but not with alkalinity, support desorption from iron oxyhydroxides as the likely mechanism of release to groundwater for arsenic and fluoride, rather than the weathering of silicate minerals. Stratigraphic and/or palaeohydrological controls may explain the observed depth distributions within the loess aquifer.

AB There is widespread awareness of the decline and collapse of many commercially important marine fish stocks worldwide. Marine protected areas are increasingly proposed for use by researchers and managers, in combination with or separate from traditional fishery management techniques (e.g., harvest quotas, size quotas, etc.), to improve this situation. Marine reserves, also known as no-take zones, are the strictest of these protected areas. We review published and government documents that explore the costs and benefits of the Tortugas Ecological Reserve - a recently-created marine reserve that is part of the much larger Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary - to three major groups of stakeholders: commercial users, recreational users, and agency personnel. Although there is a great deal of uncertainty in all cases, identifying and quantifying economic costs is more straightforward than quantifying benefits, in part because they are more well-known and more short-term in nature. The costs of creating and managing this reserve are minor on the scale of the economy of Monroe Country, Florida, but benefits, although real, are unlikely to impact stakeholders in the short-term and are thus tenuous. In some cases, direct economic incentives for those few individuals suffering direct costs (i.e., commercial interests) are recommendable. In the absence of such, and given the disparate nature of costs and benefits associated with the creation of marine reserves, adaptive and interactive management approaches, combined with traditional fishery management techniques, are recommended to achieve policy and management goals. This includes ongoing public education, outreach, and stakeholder analysis over time (coupled with strict law enforcement within reserves) if the ultimate goal of improving the sustainability of habitat and fisheries in surrounding waters is to be achieved.

AB We report the first experimental study of nitrogen fixation by corona discharge on the anoxic primitive Earth. The energy yields of nitric oxide (NO) and nitrous oxide (N2O) were experimentally determined over a wide range Of CO2-N-2 mixtures simulating the evolution of the Earth's atmosphere during the Hadean and Archean eras (from 4.5 ba to 2.5 ba). NO, the principal form of fixed nitrogen in lightning and coronal discharge in early Earth, is produced ten times less efficiently in the latter type of electrical discharge with an estimated maximum annual production rate of the order of 10(10) g yr(-1). For N2O the maximum production rate was estimated to be similar to 10(9) g yr(-1). These low rates of syntheses indicate that corona discharges as point discharges on the clouds and ground did not play a significant role in the overall pool of reactive nitrogen needed for the emergence and sustainability of life.

AB There is a huge annual trade in Himalayan medicinal plants but only limited information on their sustainable use and conservation. The aim of this paper is to investigate if sustainable commercial medicinal plant management is promoted by forest policy formation and implementation in Nepal. Data was obtained through 175 semi-structured interviews with persons from five stakeholder groups involved in commercial alpine medicinal plant exploitation and conservation in Nepal: harvesters, traders, District Forest Office staff, staff at departments and ministerial level of the Ministry of Forests and Soil Conservation, and international and local NGOs and donors. The emphasis was on recording respondents' views on the official mechanisms regulating harvest of alpine commercial medicinal plants. It was found that current approaches to non-timber forest policy formation and implementation need to be revised if objectives of conservation and sustainable management are to be achieved. Identified problems include exclusion of harvesters from the policy formation process and widespread agreement among respondents that current collection permits and bans do not strongly affect resource utilization.

TI Resuscitating the teaching of anatomical pathology in undergraduate
   medical education: Web-based innovative clinicopathological cases
SO PATHOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE pathology; education; digital images; clinicopathological case
AB Aims: Medical education has undergone substantial change in recent years, resulting in shorter, more compact courses that often contain much less pathology than previously. There has also been a concurrent decrease in the academic pathologist workforce in Australia, such that medical schools struggle to deliver even this reduced pathology curriculum. This paper reports the development and evaluation of an innovative approach in an undergraduate medical school to supporting pathology lectures, through integrating pathology with clinical medicine.
   Methods: A series of 32 clinical pathological cases (CPCs) was developed to replicate clinicopathological conferences in a small group format. The CPCs were based on the pathology lectures, developed by a multidisciplinary clinical team and delivered to the students by clinical tutors. Students had access to learning support resources on the School's Intranet in both the main campus and rural teaching sites. Digitised pathology images, Web-based delivery and semi-guided learning issues are the main characteristics of the pathology module. The module was evaluated by a ranking system by the medical students for two consecutive years.
   Results: In both years, the CPC module achieved a high score when compared with other components of the pathology curriculum. Positive feedback and frequent enquires were also received about the module.
   Conclusion: The Web-based CPC modules provide an important resource that can facilitate teaching of pathology to medical students in the main campus and rural teaching sites. The module provides an opportunity to improve the profile of pathology in the medical school, in a manner that is sustainable with only one academic pathologist. It has the potential to be used nationally and internationally because of its multidisciplinary nature and the flexibility in its mode of delivery.

DE information sharing; peer-to-peer systems; statistical mechanics; club
   formation; dynamic equilibrium
AB File-sharing systems, like many online and traditional information sharing communities (e.g. newsgroups, BBS, forums, interest clubs), are dynamical systems in nature. As peers get in and out of the system, the information content made available by the prevailing membership varies continually in amount as well as composition, which in turn affects all peers' join/leave decisions. As a result, the dynamics of membership and information content are strongly coupled, suggesting interesting issues about growth, sustenance, and stability.
   In this paper, we propose to study such communities with a simple statistical model of an information sharing club. Carrying their private payloads of information goods as potential supply to the club, peers join or leave on the basis of whether the information they demand is currently available. Information goods are chunked and typed, as in a file-sharing system where peers contribute different files, or a forum where messages are grouped by topics or threads. Peers' demand and supply are then characterized by statistical distributions over the type domain.
   This model reveals interesting critical behaviour with multiple equilibria. A sharp growth threshold is derived: the club may grow towards a sustainable equilibrium only if the value of an control parameter is above the threshold, or shrink to emptiness otherwise. The control parameter is composite and comprises the peer population size, the level of their contributed supply, the club's efficiency in information search, the spread of supply and demand over the type domain, as well as the goodness of match between them.

SO POLITY
LA English
DT Article
DE United States; Florida; everglades; water management
ID CONSERVATION; POLITICS
AB In 2000 the US Congress authorized the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP). At an estimated cost of $7.8 billion, it represents the most ambitious effort in recent US history to reform a water management infrastructure. This infrastructure is located in South Florida and controls water in the Everglades. As the title of this plan indicates, the effort to reform this water manipulation system is being promoted as a means to restore the health of the Everglades eco-system. By placing CERP within a historical context, the author of this paper demonstrates that CERP is a continuation of the historic process to utilize the Everglades - its land, water and soil - as a means to maximize capital accumulation. This process has been led and shaped by economic elites and producer groups, which is consistent with the business dominance view of the policymaking process. Finally, the portrayal of CERP as an effort to restore the health of the Everglades eco-system obfuscates the fact that it is predominately a water supply plan designed to further urban growth, and that CERP contains some significant hazards for the environment in the Everglades.

AB Utilisation of grazed grass should form the basis of sustainable dairy systems in the future. Grazed grass is the cheapest feed available for dairy cows and may also help to reduce the environmental impact of the most intensive systems while giving a natural image of farming. Efficient exploitation of grass by grazing will require the development of grazing systems designed to maximise daily herbage intake per cow while maintaining a greater quantity of high quality pasture over the grazing season. This paper discusses the conditions for efficient exploitation of grass and outlines the possibilities for future advances. There are opportunities to consume more grass by extending the grazing season in early spring and late autumn or by intentionally deferring grazing from a period of grass surplus in the spring to a period of grass shortage in the summer. The introduction of legumes in grass-based swards should also be seriously considered as an alternative option to pure grass swards in order to maximise cow performance. There are also opportunities to manage seasonal production of grass by plant selection, improved N fertilisation strategies and better grazing management. The opportunity to increase cow performance by decreasing stocking rates is rather limited because this practise is constrained by the necessity to maintain high quality swards over the grazing season, unless alternative strategies are adopted. Increasing leaf blade mass at the base of the sward by appropriate grazing management in the early spring may play a major role in increasing herbage intake. This will result in a low residual sward height thus making grazing management easier. This requires a greater knowledge of the carryover effects of early season grazing management on mid-season pasture quality and the implication for milk output per hectare. In the future, development of reliable decision support methods and tools for short term rationing of grass at the paddock level and long term budgeting of grass at the farm level will give farmers more confidence in grazing and will undoubtedly contribute to optimising the proportion of grazed grass in the annual diet of the dairy cow.

SO QUALITY & SAFETY IN HEALTH CARE

ID CARE
AB Background: Pilot studies of complex interventions such as a team checklist are an essential precursor to evaluating how these interventions affect quality and safety of care. We conducted a pilot implementation of a preoperative team communication checklist. The objectives of the study were to assess the feasibility of the checklist (that is, team members' willingness and ability to incorporate it into their work processes); to describe how the checklist tool was used by operating room (OR) teams; and to describe perceived functions of the checklist discussions.
   Methods: A checklist prototype was developed and OR team members were asked to implement it before 18 surgical procedures. A research assistant was present to prompt the participants, if necessary, to initiate each checklist discussion. Trained observers recorded ethnographic field notes and 11 brief feedback interviews were conducted. Observation and interview data were analyzed for trends.
   Results: The checklist was implemented by theOR team in all 18 study cases. The rate of team participation was 100% (33 vascular surgery team members). The checklist discussions lasted 1 - 6 minutes (mean 3.5) and most commonly took place in the OR before the patient's arrival. Perceived functions of the checklist discussions included provision of detailed case related information, confirmation of details, articulation of concerns or ambiguities, team building, education, and decision making. Participants consistently valued the checklist discussions. The most significant barrier to undertaking the team checklist was variability in team members' preoperative workflow patterns, which sometimes presented a challenge to bringing the entire team together.
   Conclusions: The preoperative team checklist shows promise as a feasible and efficient tool that promotes information exchange and team cohesion. Further research is needed to determine the sustainability and generalizability of the checklist intervention, to fully integrate the checklist routine into workflow patterns, and to measure its impact on patient safety.
