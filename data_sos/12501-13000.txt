DT Article
DE sustainability; environmental degradation; mega-city
AB The immense growth of cities, especially in developing countries, is resulting in the urbanization of both poverty and environmental degradation to a greater degree than ever before. This paper examines the processes of growth and degradation in the Greater Cairo Metropolitan Region (GCMR), currently the world's tenth largest mega-city. It reviews the region's growth and selected environmental issues as well as impacts of current efforts on managing the region. The assertion of this paper is that current management policies and bodies lack a comprehensive view of urban governance for the region, which does not bode well for the future environmental and economic sustainability of the region.

DE carbon sequestration; CDM; forest certification; Forest Stewardship
   Council; sustainable forest management
AB Parties negotiating the Kyoto Protocol recently agreed that Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) investments can include carbon sequestration projects in developing countries. However, guidelines for achieving the socio-economic and environmental objectives of the CDM, and other concerns with sinks projects, have yet to be elaborated. Independently of the Kyoto process, international efforts have advanced to define and certify sustainably managed forests through processes, such as that of the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC). In this paper, the FSC-US principles and criteria for sustainable forest management are evaluated in light of current concerns for guiding afforestation and reforestation projects in the CDM. It is found that the FSC criteria would help to meet some of the objectives of the Kyoto Protocol, including provisions to reduce the risk of premature carbon loss, and features that could somewhat lessen leakage of emissions outside the project area. Existing FSC monitoring and verification procedures provide some, but insufficient, overlap with expected requirements for measuring carbon stock changes. FSC principles and criteria articulate stringent guidelines for meeting environmental and social goals that reflect years of negotiations between environmental, timber, human rights and labor interests.

TI Future restrictions for sinks in the CDM - How about a cap on supply?

DT Article
DE Kyoto Protocol; CDM; LULUCF; forests; supplementarity; sustainable
   development
AB The first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol is expected to result in only a small role for the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), including afforestation and reforestation projects. Wide ranging concerns regarding sinks in the CDM have been reflected in the Marrakech Accords capping the total amount of emission offsets from sinks projects to be used by Annex I countries. Decisions about the second commitment period and beyond are likely to be of far greater importance for these projects.
   This paper contributes to the discussion on how caps on sinks under the CDM could be used to obtain overall improved outcomes for developing countries. We examine two distinctive ways in which quantitative caps on sinks in the CDM can be implemented: one, restricting the use of sinks CERs to meet targets, as under the Marrakech Accords (a cap on demand); and two, restricting supply of sink CERs using a quota system. We argue in favour of a supply side cap, if Parties are to preserve the idea of limiting sinks in the CDM. Limiting the supply of credits could lead to better financial outcomes for developing countries as a whole, make higher-cost projects viable which may have better sustainability impacts, and provide an alternative to deal with equity concerns between developing countries.

AB Land acquisition is one of the keys to biodiversity conservation, and it is a transdisciplinary endeavor requiring consideration of natural and social phenomena. I integrated principles of conservation biology, ecological economics, and political science to outline an approach to conservation land acquisition in the United States. American political economy, especially, has profound implications for conservation land acquisition, yet these implications have been largely neglected by public land conservation agencies. I derived three general recommendations for the conservation of biodiversity via land acquisition: ( 1) relatively inexpensive lands in relatively intact ecosystems should be prioritized for acquisition, ( 2) fee-title acquisition should be favored over easement acquisition, and ( 3) low-lying coastal properties should receive lower priority. These recommendations contribute to an ecologically macroeconomic approach to conservation land acquisition, and each will become more appropriate as the sizes of the U. S. and global economies increase. Ultimately, however, the conservation of biodiversity will require a new political economy predicated on sustainability rather than growth.

AB Ugandan farmers were interviewed in order to investigate their knowledge, perceptions and ability to manage pests in agroforestry generally and on Alnus species particularly. Farmers' ability to recognise pest problems on Alnus species was significantly influenced by their length of experience in cultivating the species, but not their age, sex or formal education. Most farmers (77%) were aware of pest problems-on Alnus species. However, identification of pest problems was based largely on damage type rather than causal agents. Whereas farmers had good knowledge of vertebrate pests of Alnus, insects and diseases that infest the tree species, were unknown to most farmers. Apis mellifera damage on Alnus was the most frequently described damage, but its cause was either unknown or misdiagnosed. Most farmers did not control insect and disease infestations on Alnus because they did not know the causal agents and/or appropriate control measures. Farmers were generally more knowledgeable on insect and disease infestations on crops than on multipurpose tree species (MPTS) and most of them (98%) perceived that crops suffer more damage from such pests than do MPTS. However, farmers' ability to manage insect pests and diseases seemed weak on both crops and MPTS. Most farmers suggested the use of pesticides to combat pests, but they mentioned only one insecticide, permethrin and one fungicide, mancozeb. More alarming were the suggestions by a few farmers on the use of mancozeb against aphids, and permethrin to combat crop wilt and dieback. Farmers need to be educated about diagnosis, basic ecology and management strategies for both crop and tree pests to ensure sustainable pest control in agroforestry. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB In Australian grain-growing regions, the evolution of weeds resistant to multiple herbicides threatens the sustainability of existing cropping systems. As a result, herbicide susceptibility is considered to be a potentially exhaustible resource. Based on a survey of 132 Western Australian grain growers, perceptions of various factors relating to the herbicide resource were measured. These include the rate of resistance evolution, cost of resistance, the future availability of replacement herbicides, reductions in the level of resistance in a population over time, and mobility of resistance. Growers were found to have a generally high level of awareness of herbicide resistance and consider it to have a high potential cost. However, many perceive that the stock of effective herbicides is likely to be renewed in the short term, either through new herbicide development or resistance reversion. Potential opportunities for targeted extension to improve farmer decision-making are identified. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Anthropogenic disturbance of deep-sea benthic systems, especially by fishing, has increased markedly in the last 40 years. Deep-sea mining and extraction of fossil fuels can occur at extraordinary intensity at individual sites, but the large number of fishing vessels and their mobility probably makes commercial trawling the most pervasive of our marine activities to depths of up to about 1200 m. Knowledge of the effects of trawling on soft-sediment. benthic communities is, however, limited to shallow, coastal systems, mostly at small spatial scales. We extend that knowledge to deeper systems at the scale of commercial fishing by assessing the effects of bottom trawling in northeastern New Zealand. We characterized the invertebrate catch of 66 research trawls spread along 220 km of continental slope in depths of 200-600 m (encompassing about 2400 km(2)) At each site, we indexed the intensity of previous trawling using trawl-by-trawl fishing returns. A suite of multivariate analyses revealed that fishing activity was negatively associated (after excluding the effects of depth and location) with invertebrate species richness and diversity and with the density of several taxa. Our models explained up to two thirds of the variation in the invertebrate catch of research trawls. After excluding the effects of depth and location, we attributed 11-40% of total variation to fishing. Concordance among the results of several multivariate methods based on different analytical approaches and assumptions reveals a strong and coherent pattern in the data that is consistent with the predicted and observed effects of trawl fisheries and other sources of physical disturbance. We infer that trawling probably changes benthic community structure and reduces biodiversity over broad spatial scales on the continental slope as well as in coastal systems. Such effects would have important implications for local and regional biodiversity and for the development and management of sustainable fisheries.

AB Unsustainable consumption patterns of the North (or rather of the global affluent consumers class) have been identified by Agenda 21 as one of the key driving forces behind the unsustainable development. However, neither accounting based on the system of national accounts SNA nor household economics provide the proper instruments to assess the environmental impact of household decision making. Eco-efficiency assessments as familiar in the business sector provide no appropriate tool for households. As an alternative an environmental space based assessment scheme is suggested covering the major pressures on the environment caused by household decisions. The methodology is used twice: once to analyse the environmental relevance of the main activity clusters of household consumption and once to identify the dominant acts of consumption within each cluster. The latter provide the basis for deriving environmental performance indicators. A rough analysis of household influence potentials permits to identify housing, eating and mobility as the three priority fields for action for minimising the environmental impact of households. Extending the influence analysis actor matrixes are derived allocating influence and thus responsibility for environmental pressures to different groups of economic agents.

AB This article has the aim to provide a methodological framework for the calculation of ecological footprints related to leisure tourism. Based on the example of the Seychelles, it reveals the statistical obstacles that have to be overcome in the calculation process and discusses the strengths and weaknesses of such an approach. As many tropical island-states depend heavily on foreign exchange earnings derived from visitors arriving by air, special attention is paid to the use of energy associated with air travel. Furthermore, implications of the findings for national greenhouse inventories are discussed. Finally, as the Seychelles have safeguarded a wide range of ecosystems in protected areas, which are for their existence ultimately dependent on financial resources derived from tourism, the question is raised if long-distance travel can be a means to safeguard biodiversity.

SO ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS

DT Article
DE sustainability; vision; human capital; social capital; natural capital
AB Economics has been defined as the science of allocation of scarce resources towards alternative ends. This definition implies that the first step in economic analysis is to determine what ends are desirable for society. Most sectors of the society would agree that sustainability is a desirable end, but there is little agreement as to what a sustainable future would look like. The University of Maryland Institute for Ecological Economics sponsored a democratic future search process designed to create a relatively detailed, shared vision of a sustainable and desirable USA in the year 2100. This paper presents the vision developed at that conference, examines the resources required to achieve the vision, and assesses the suitability of market mechanisms for allocating the required resources towards the desired ends. We find that markets are not efficient mechanisms for allocation in this case, and propose the institutions of a 'strong democracy' as a promising alternative. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB This paper presents a study of a secondary school in Queensland, Australia, involved in an innovative change process called IDEAS (Innovative Design for Enhancing Achievement in Schools). This process of change centres on the action of teachers in classrooms rather than change in organizational structures. Our main findings illustrate how a group of teachers created a professional community through their participation in the process. We found that shared understanding developed through professional learning can impact on action in the classroom. However, the sustainability of this action within the organization will depend on the established professional community's ability to create a broader 'school-wide' understanding of these new relationships. It will also require developing a new image of teacher and student and their workplace. Through their development of this image, the teachers are in the process of creating a school for students of the twenty-first century, in line with their vision.

AB Achieving sustainable development is a target that is now widely seen as important to worldwide public opinion. In this context, the utilization of renewable energy resources such as solar, geothermal, and wind energy appears to be one of the most efficient and effective ways of achieving this target. Recently, wind power as a potential energy has grown at an impressive rate in Turkey. This paper investigates the status and future directions of wind energy development in Turkey as of the end of October 2001. Electricity generation through wind energy for general use was first realized in Izmir, Turkey in 1986 with a 55 kW nominal wind energy capacity. However, the development of wind energy in Turkey started about 3 years ago when some wind plants were installed at several locations in the country. To date, 3 wind power plants were installed with a total capacity of 18.9 MW. It is projected that the total installed capacity will reach about 504 MW by the end of 2002. Present applications have shown that wind energy in Turkey is a promising alternative. As the public recognizes the projects, the progress will continue.

AB New participatory forest management policies are being promoted in South Africa involving devolution from the state to local communities at a time when traditional authority has been eroded and is weak. Here, attitudes of forest stakeholders (forest resource users and managers) to three possible forest management policies, as well as to resource use, were investigated using questionnaires. There was concordance in the attitudes of resource users and managers and a general lack of support for community forest management (CFM), particularly among older resource users. Power shifts, uncertainty about land tenure and the management of what has essentially become an open-access system, all confound attempts to implement community-based forestry programmes. Local communities appeared to be wary of taking on responsibility for forest management at this time and indicated comparatively stronger support for state forest management (SFM). Forest stakeholders were more equivocal in their support for participatory forest management (PFM), although this probably reflects a poor understanding by forest users of the new PFM process. No stakeholders supported a total ban on forest resource use, but all supported controlled use. These latter attitudes were independent of the preferred management system (i.e. CFM, SFM or PFM). This study corroborates the view that CFM has been overemphasized. Rather than narrowing forest management around communities, but recognizing the state's incapacity to ensure the integrity of forest resources into the future without the co-operation of forest users, an all-inclusive approach, such as PFM, provides for greater management input by the state.

ID SYSTEM
AB Shiyang River basin is located in Hexi Corridor, central-west Gansu province, northwest China. It is an area of typical and to semiarid features. During the last century, especially the last half century, mankind's production activities have caused a series of detrimental environmental effects, which are summarized: water environment change, land desertification and salinization, and vegetation degeneracy. Changes in the water environment include the surface water system, water quantities, continuous lowering of the groundwater table and degradation of groundwater quality. Vegetation cover in the lower reaches is seriously degenerated, resulting in land desertification, salinization and dust storms. Analysis indicates that the rate of the groundwater table lowering in Shiyang River basin generally exceeds 0.3 m/year, and the mean annual rate of groundwater decrease in Wuwei and Minqing sub-basins reaches 1.11-3.98%. Until 1998, the shortage of groundwater volume was 4.526x10(8) m(3). If no effective measures are taken, this figure will be 6.728x10(8) m(3) in 2010. Remedial actions include: (1) recovery and protection of the water conservancy function of the mountain forests to ensure the sustainable development of this recharge area; (2) establishment of an authoritative agency to reasonably allocate the total water resources in Shiyang River basin; and (3) enactment of legislation and economic control to build up a water-saving society in Shiyang River basin.

AB "Avanpa Brasil" (Forward Brazil) is a package of 338 projects throughout Brazil; the portion of the plan to be carried out in Brazil's Legal Amazon region totals US$43 billion over 8 years, US$20 billion of which would be for infrastructure causing environmental damage. Brazil's environmental impact assessment system is not yet capable of coping with the challenge presented by Avanpa Brasil. Generic problems with the licensing process include stimulation of a lobby in favor of construction before decisions are made on the advisability of the projects, the "dragging effect" of third parties, whereby economic activity is attracted to the infrastructure but escapes the environmental impact assessment system, a tendency for consulting firms to produce favorable reports, a bureaucratic emphasis on the existence of steps without regard to the content of what is said, and the inability to take account of the chain of events unleashed when a given project is undertaken.
   The environmental and social costs of forest loss are high; among them is loss of opportunities for sustainable use of the forest, including loss of environmental services such as biodiversity maintenance, water cycling, and carbon storage. The benefits of export infrastructure are meager, especially from the point of view of generating employment. Much of the transportation infrastructure is for soybeans, while the hydroelectric dams contribute to processing aluminum. The example of Avanpa Brasil makes clear the need to rethink how major development decisions are made and to reconsider a number of the plan's component projects.

AB An overview of the structure and elements of integrated models aimed at studying fishery management policies using static and dynamic optimisation techniques is presented. Continuous and discrete time models are considered under both open-access and sole-owner settings. A variety of economic and biological processes that affect the fishery as a whole is examined. It turns out that overseeing important fish population characteristics such as metapopulation dynamics and multi-species interaction can lead to serious misrepresentation of the fishery and suboptimal controls. Adequate understanding of the economic conditions and considerations potentially affecting the fishermen is necessary to model their behaviour and address their concerns. Misrepresentation of these economic and biologic processes will have an impact on the success of management policies in attaining a sustainable fish population.

TI A method to assess the freshwater inflow requirements of estuaries and
   application to the Mtata estuary, South Africa
SO ESTUARIES

ID WATER INFLOW; EASTERN CAPE
AB The National Water Act (Act 36 of 1998) in South Africa recognizes basic human water requirements as well as the need to sustain the country's freshwater and estuarine ecosystems in a healthy condition for present as well as future generations. In this Act, provision is made for a water reserve to be estimated prior to the authorization of water use (e.g., for agriculture, large volume residential and industrial uses) through licensing. This reserve is the water required to satisfy basic human needs (i.e., 25 1 person(-1) d(-1)) and to protect aquatic ecosystems to ensure present and future sustainable use of the resource. This led the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry and estuarine scientists throughout South Africa to develop a method to determine the freshwater inflow requirements of estuaries. The method includes documenting the geographical boundaries of the estuary and determining estuarine health by comparing the present state of the estuary with a predicted reference condition with the use of an Estuarine Health Index. The importance of the estuary as an ecosystem is taken from a national rating system and together with the present health is used to set an Ecological Reserve Category for the estuary. This category represents the level of protection afforded to an estuary. Freshwater is then reserved to maintain the estuary in that Ecological Reserve Category. The Reserve, the quantity and quality of freshwater required for the estuary, is determined using an approach where realistic future river runoff scenarios are assessed, together with data for present state and reference conditions, to evaluate the extent to which abiotic and biotic conditions within an estuary are likely to vary with changes in river inflow. Results from these evaluations are used to select an acceptable river flow scenario that represents the highest reduction in freshwater inflow that will still protect the aquatic ecosystem of the estuary and keep it in the desired Ecological Reserve Category. The application of the Reserve methodology to the Mtata estuary is described.

AB Estuaries are highly complex ecosystems. Consequently they present daunting challenges to planners and regulators responsible for devising 'sustainable development' strategies or for taking rapid decisions with respect to 'crisis management'. Over the lifetime of the Estuarine and Coastal Sciences Association, there have been significant developments in both the range and sophistication of the tools available to assist with these tasks. Indeed, managers are now faced with a confusing plethora of possibilities that may, or may not, help in achieving the optimum solution to a given problem.
   Typical problems confronting managers and the systems available to resolve the issues are considered. By way of illustration, we present some examples based on our experience over the last 25 years in the Mersey Estuary (which has seen dramatic improvements in water quality and a number of major proposed developments), from the Ribble Estuary and from along the north-west coast of the U.K. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB The long-term benefits of retaining or planting trees on farms to rehabilitate land and protect the soil from erosion or salinity problems has to be traded off against the impact of tree competition on commercial crops, especially in the medium to low rainfall regions of Australia. The incentive to plant trees would increase if tree competition could be offset by economic returns gained from farm forestry products and by the beneficial impacts of tree windbreaks on crop yields and resource sustainability. The Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) has a well-established capability to simulate cropping systems and this paper reports on progress in applying APSIM to agroforestry systems in order to quantify the potential benefits and risks of planting trees as windbreaks to cropping land in Australia. A simple case study indicating one possible model configuration is used to demonstrate this emergent capability for simulating tree and crop productivity and their interactions. The simulated agroforestry system consisted of the growth of a belt of trees (Eucalyptus argophloia) positioned as a windbreak on the edge of a field where a crop of winter chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) is grown over a 30-year period. The example simulations quantify the yield and economic returns of annual chickpea crops in addition to the discounted economic return from timber production after 30 years of tree growth. This example demonstrates how APSIM can be used to quantify the economic tradeoffs in planting trees as windbreaks on a commercial farm in a low rainfall region of Australia.

AB The preservation of plant residues is important for sustainable arable cropping. Lignin is a marker for plant residues in soils. We have investigated influences of the length of cultivation on the dynamics of lignin. Composite samples were taken from the top 20 cm of soils that have been cropped for periods varying from 0 to 98 years in each of three different agro-ecosystems in the Free State Province of South Africa. Lignin-derived phenols were determined in the < 2 &mu;m (clay), 2-20 &mu;m (silt), 20-250 &mu;m (fine sand) and 250-2000 &mu;m (coarse sand) size separates. With increasing length of cultivation, the concentration of such phenols decreased to 36% of that in the grassland. The lignin contents as proportions of the total carbon did not change during cultivation, suggesting that there was no selective enrichment of lignin moieties as C was lost as a result of cultivation. The loss rate constants of lignin concentrations in particle-size fractions increased in the order clay (0.17 year(-1)) &LE; silt (0.18 year(-1)) < fine sand (0.20 year(-1)) < coarse sand (0.22 year(-1)). Increasing ratios of phenolic acids to aldehydes in bulk soil, silt and fine sand fractions with increasing length of cultivation indicated that side chains were being oxidized. The ratios in the silt fraction, however, decreased after 10-20 years. We attribute this to a loss of lignin together with silt by wind erosion, resulting in a rejuvenation of lignin compounds in the remaining silt-sized pools of C.

AB Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), present in climbing and mossy fiber afferents to the adult mouse cerebellum, acts as a neuromodulator to enhance the spontaneous and amino-acid-induced firing rate of Purkinje cells. CRF also is present during development of the mouse cerebellum, at ages that precede synaptogenesis, which suggests that it may have a different function during development compared to its modulatory role in the adult. The intent of this study was to determine when CRF begins to affect the firing rate of Purkinje cells as well as the time course over which this effect matures. The earliest effect of CRF was elicited at postnatal day (P) 9. at which time a weak enhancement in the amplitude of the firing rate was recorded. However, the amplitude, time to peak, sustainability, and duration of the response were significantly different from that recorded in the older animals or adults. The excitatory effect of CRF became stronger and the duration of the response increased progressively from P9 until it was adult-like by P20. Purkinje cells in the posterior lobe vermis developed a mature response before those in the anterior lobe or hemispheres. Data from previous studies have shown that CRF and its type 1 receptor are present in the cerebellum before birth and that both undergo major reorganization around P10. Taken together, these immunohistochemical observations and the present physiologic data indicate that CRF does not modulate the activity of Purkinje cells until the peptide begins to assume an adult-like distribution in cerebellar afferents.

CT Symposium on Welfare Reform Under the Labour Government
CY MAY   22, 2002

AB This paper examines New Labour's social security and related policies since 1997 in the light of evidence on public attitudes. The list of measures where policies have been in or have come into line with public attitudes is much longer than the list of measures where policies have been out of line with public attitudes or appear to have led them. One interpretation is that policy has been led by opinion surveys and focus groups, with opportunities lost to take more radical action and then persuade people of the need and justification for it. An alternative would be that policy has navigated with the grain of some of the more progressive parts of public opinion to achieve a result that has carried the public with it, in a way that would not have been sustainable if there had simply been an increase in the generosity of an unreformed social security system.

   the case of the North Atlantic
SO FISH AND FISHERIES
LA English
DT Article
DE buy-back; decommissioning; level of subsidies; open access; private
   property
AB This paper provides both an estimate and assessment of subsidies in fisheries in the North Atlantic. The subsidies are estimated, on the basis of data taken from an OECD study and the Sea Around US Project database, to be in the order of US$ 2.0-2.5 billion per year. The assessment of the impact of the subsidies upon resource management and sustainability requires an examination of the underlying economics of subsidies in fisheries. There is general agreement, to which we subscribe, that fisheries subsidies do great harm by exacerbating the problems arising from the 'common pool' aspects of capture fisheries. Many economists, however, believe it that, if the 'common pool' aspects of a fishery could be removed by, for example, establishing a full-fledged property rights system, the negative impact of fisheries subsidies would prove to be trivial.
   This paper demonstrates that the aforementioned comfortable belief is unfounded. Fisheries subsidies can be seriously damaging, even if the 'common pool' aspects of the fishery are removed. There is also a widely held belief among economists and government officials that subsidies used for vessel decommissioning schemes, far from being harmful, actually have a beneficial impact upon resource management and sustainability, or are at worst, neutral. About 20% of the fisheries subsidies in the North Atlantic are directed towards these purposes. In this paper, we argue that these seemingly beneficial subsides can, in fact, be highly negative in their impact.

FX When the Fisheries Centre, University of British Columbia commenced the
   first phase of its Sea Around US Project (SAUP: see
   http://www.fisheries.ubc.ca) focused on the North Atlantic, it seemed
   obvious that one issue, which would have to be examined was the
   magnitude, and the impact of fisheries subsidies upon resource
   management in the region. This paper arises from the resultant SAUP
   study on fisheries subsidies in the North Atlantic. We would like to
   thank the Environment Project of The Pew Charitable Trusts,
   Philadelphia, for its financial support through the Sea Around US
   Project. We would also like to thank our colleague, Colin W Clark, for
   his unstinting advice and assistance, and to thank the participants in
   the April 2001, Sea Around US Final Report Workshop, Nanaimo, Canada,
   for their insightful comments. Finally, we would like to acknowledge the
   many useful comments of the four referees for this paper.

DE effort allocation; fisheries management; maximum sustainable yield; MSY;

ID CATCH
AB The allocation of effort among fishing gears is as important as controlling effort with respect to both sustainable yield and ecosystem management. Differences in age-specific vulnerability to the fishing method can modify the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) that is obtainable from a fish stock. Different gears or methods are more or less selective for the species targeted, and MSY is rarely, if ever, attainable simultaneously for all species. The different fishing methods capture different types of nontarget species. Some methods will often be more profitable than others, and different user groups will prefer different methods. In many fisheries, it is unlikely that fishing can be limited to a single gear or method, so compromises among them will be required. Global MSY is discussed as a possible reference point for fisheries management. The yellowfin tuna fishery in the eastern Pacific Ocean (EPO) shows all the above characteristics and is used to illustrate effort allocation among fishing methods.

AB In northern industrialized countries, the inland fisheries sector has long been dominated by recreational fisheries, which normally exploit fish for leisure or subsistence and provide many (poorly investigated) benefits to society. Various factors constrain the development and existence of inland fisheries, such as local user conflicts, low social priority and inadequate research and funding. In many cases, however, degradation of the environment and loss of aquatic habitat are the predominant concerns for the sustainability of inland fisheries. The need for concerted effort to prevent and reduce environmental degradation, as well as conservation of freshwater fish and fisheries as renewable common pool resources or entities in their own right is the greatest challenge facing sustainable development of inland waters. In inland fisheries management, the declining quality of the aquatic environment coupled with long-term inadequate and often inappropriate fisheries management has led to an emphasis on enhancement practices, such as stocking, to mitigate anthropogenic stress. However, this is not always the most appropriate management approach. Therefore, there is an urgent need to alter many traditional inland fisheries management practices and systems to focus on sustainable development.
   This paper reviews the literature regarding the inputs needed for sustainability of inland fisheries in industrialized countries. To understand better the problems facing sustainable inland fisheries management, the inland fisheries environment, its benefits, negative impacts and constraints, as well as historical management, paradigms, trends and current practices are described. Major philosophical shifts, challenges and promising integrated management approaches are envisaged in a holistic framework. The following are considered key elements for sustainable development of inland fisheries: communication, information dissemination, education, institutional restructuring, marketing outreach, management plans, decision analysis, socioeconomic evaluation and research into the human dimension, in addition to traditional biological and ecological sciences. If these inputs are integrated with traditional fisheries management practices, the prospects for sustainability in the inland fisheries will be enhanced.

   over-exploitation
AB Since humans began fishing (at least 90 000 years ago), fishing technology has developed with the objective of trying to catch the greatest quantities of fish possible, of an ever-increasing variety. Fishing technology has evolved from simple harpoons and hooks to the industrial factory trawlers of the 20th century. After millennia of assuming that seafood resources are inexhaustible, and centuries of somewhat muted concerns that advanced fishing technologies may have detrimental impacts on stocks and ecosystems, the last century has seen advances in fishing technology blamed as a major cause of the current over-exploitation of fish stocks. It has mainly been during the last few decades that fishing technologists have begun to focus on more conservation-orientated goals. This occurred initially in response to concerns over the by-catch of charismatic species (like dolphins in tuna purse-seines), but quickly broadened to address concerns over the discarding of not-so-charismatic species (like juvenile fish killed by shrimp trawling). To ameliorate these issues, technologists and commercial fishers successfully developed various innovative gear-based and operational solutions. The steps involved in successfully reducing by-catches have tended to follow a certain incremental framework involving identification of problems using observer programmes, developing technological solution to these problems, experimentally testing these solutions, implementing these solutions throughout industry and finally gaining acceptance of the solutions from concerned interest groups. Most recently public concern has broadened once again from by-catch issues to encompass a much wider context involving the impacts of fishing on entire ecosystems, i.e. the impacts of fishing on all species affected not just those species caught, retained or discarded. As a consequence, there have been many calls for ecosystem-based fisheries management to ensure that fisheries operate under the principles of ecologically sustainable development. Scientists are gradually filling the gaps in our knowledge about how fishing affects whole ecosystems but, because of the scales and complexities involved, such studies are usually difficult, expensive and of long duration. While this descriptive work is difficult, finding solutions to any identified problem is an even greater challenge, particularly for fishing technologists. The easiest solutions to such problems involve rather draconian management strategies like closures. A less extreme alternative involves the development of new technologies that reduce the impacts of fishing on ecosystems - in a similar way as that done to reduce by-catch problems. Innovations like altering ground-chains, footropes, sweeps and trawl doors have been suggested as possible ways to ameliorate the environmental damage done by trawling, but such research is still very much in its infancy. Nevertheless, the recent history of fishing technology is chequered with successfully meeting such challenges, giving one confidence that solutions to such issues may eventually be developed. Integral to the success of any solutions that strive towards the goal of perfect selectivity, however, is a corresponding improvement in the adoption of these methods by fishers. As our framework shows, this is best achieved by involving fishers in all aspects of the work.

AB In this article we outline three different modes of natural resource governance that can be traced in international policy making and planning over the last 40 years. We show that a shift from the hierarchical to the heterarchical mode of governance can be found in natural resource governance. Agenda 21 introduced new planning ideas to the international decision-making process. with all countries and levels of government asked to assume responsibility for natural resource policy. Deliberation and participation of major groups is now emphasised, and forests are viewed at the international level as an inter-state matter of a transboundary nature. The deliberations and outputs of the Intergovernmental Panel on Forests (IPF). the Intergovernmental Forum on Forests OFF) and the United Nations Forum on Forests (UNFF) are an empirical validation of this. We further argue that different planning approaches were inspired by the hierarchical and heterarchical modes of governance. The Tropical Forestry Action Plan, aimed at reducing deforestation in tropical forest countries, was primarily a technocratic planning tool, implemented by external staff and focused mainly on the forestry sector. National Forest Programmes (NFP), on the contrary, are oriented at implementing international commitments to enhance sustainable forest management following deliberative and participatory approaches at the national level. NFPs can also be seen as a framework for national decision-making activities, hence this shift in the mode of governance is also reflected at the national level. We further outline what the international community expects NFPs to deliver, as referred to in the Proposals for Action issued by the IPF and IFF Analysis indicates that those IPF/IFF Proposals for Action making reference to NFPs are in those categories calling for improved international co-operation and technology transfer, as well as the provision of financial assistance and the promotion of public participation. We propose a conceptual framework for assessing the implementation of the IPF/IFF Proposals for Action at the national level. This assessment can be used to identify and communicate relevant topics. priorities, implementation responsibilities and implementation gaps. It can also be used as an ex post-evaluation tool to analyse the implementation of international agreements. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Participation is about finding consensus in diversity and reflects a normative shift towards multiple-use values that recognise that forest management should blend multiple management objectives into a coherent set of practices. A framework to incorporate interest groups' values and needs into functional forest management systems has yet to be institutionalised in contemporary forest policy and management. Participation is not just a means but also a model for involving those concerned. It should be understood as a pro-active approach for creating an enhanced understanding of objectives, problems and their solution. Optimally any participative process will help to create more informed operative decisions, and thus provide a more solid base for policy outputs, increasing the chance of reaching 'sustainable' decisions that consider long-term effects. The analytical framework of this paper draws on theoretical traditions within the sociology of law and legal theory, and analyses some recent national legislation and international law with respect to participation. It proposes a set of guidelines that aim to facilitate participation (as opposed to merely pro forma consultation) with particular reference to the formulation and implementation of National Forest Programmes (NFPs).

DT Article
DE multi-level co-ordination; National Forest Programmes
AB The concept of National Forest Programmes (NFP) calls for the integration of multiple levels of government as well as the integration of private actors into the programming, implementation and evaluation of measures to promote sustainable forest management. But systems of multi-level policy co-ordination are threatened by overload and deadlock owing to the large numbers of levels, arenas and actors involved. This paper examines the mechanisms that may cause these problems and aims at identifying some potential escape routes from imminent deadlock. In order to achieve this, I discuss the problem-solving capacity and limits of different modes of multi-level co-ordination against the background of NFPs. After problem description, the aim is to learn from real world policy processes how policy makers handle problems of multi-level co-ordination, and how they can evade dangers of overload and deadlock. The examples are taken from European social and employment policy and from regional development policy. They show that specific patterns of arranging policy arenas and negotiations can provide viable solutions. The proposals range from governance by hierarchy to structures of more or less autonomous arenas that are loosely coupled by policy brokers. Beyond that, I argue that two EU regulations already embody the core of our current understanding of NFPs, namely the Regulation on the Support of Rural Development in combination with the Structural Funds Regulations.

AB This paper analyses the existing legal framework and political culture in Austria with regard to the procedural elements and output of a National Forest Programme (NFP). The procedural elements of a NFP have been defined by international organisations in the Rio follow-up process. The output of a NFP relates to the goal of the sustainable management, conservation and sustainable development of forests. At present there is no NFP in Austria. For the procedural elements of participation. intersectoral co-ordination and long-term, iterative and adaptive planning a weak legal framework exists that has so far impeded NFP formation. Regarding the output of a NFP, the Austrian Forest Act and other forest regulations focus strongly on timber production rather than ecological, social and cultural goals. On account of these shortcomings, the process and output of a substantive NFP requires some changes in Austria's legal framework and political culture. The corporatist structure of the Austrian forestry sector appears to be the central explicative variable for the weak shaping of most of the NFP elements in legislation and practice.

AB 1. To illustrate advances made in biomanipulation research during the last decade, seven main topics that emerged after the first biomanipulation conference in 1989 are discussed in relation to the papers included in this special issue and the general literature.
   2. The substantially higher success rates of biomanipulations in shallow as opposed to stratified lakes can be attributed to several positive feedback mechanisms relating mainly to the recovery of submerged macrophytes.
   3. The role of both nutrient loading and in-lake concentrations in predicting the success of biomanipulations is emphasised and supported by empirically defined threshold values. Nutrient recycling by aquatic organisms (such as fish) can contribute to the bottom-up effects on lake food webs, although the degree can vary greatly among lakes.
   4. Ontogenetic niche shifts and size-structured interactions particularly of fish populations add to the complexity of lake food webs and make scientifically sound predictions of biomanipulation success more difficult than was previously envisaged.
   5. Consideration of appropriate temporal and spatial scales in biomanipulation research is crucial to understanding food web effects induced by changes in fish communities. This topic needs to be further developed.
   6. An appropriate balance between piscivorous, planktivorous and benthivorous fishes is required for long-lasting success of biomanipulations. Recommended proportions and absolute densities of piscivorous fish are currently based on data from only a few biomanipulation experiments and need to be corroborated by additional and quantitative assessments of energy flow through lake food webs.
   7. Biomanipulation effects in stratified lakes can be sustained in the long term only by continued interventions. Alternate stable states of food web composition probably exist only in shallow lakes, but even here repeated interventions may be needed as long as nutrient inputs remain high.
   8. Biomanipulation is increasingly used as a lake restoration technique by considering the needs of all lake users (sustainability approach). The combination of water quality management and fisheries management for piscivores with positive effects for both appears to be particularly promising.
   9. Biomanipulation research has contributed substantially to progress in understanding complex lake food webs, which should in turn promote a higher success rate of future whole-lake biomanipulations.

AB A preliminary conceptual design of dual-cooled long-lived radioactive waste transmutation blanket for the Fusion-Driven sub-critical hybrid System (FDS) is presented on the basis of feasible plasma physics and technology level i.e. the neutron wall loading is assumed to 0.5 MW/m(2) with availability of 50%. The concept has the attractive advantages e.g. tritium is self-sustainable, plutonium for the purpose of neutron multiplication is self-sustainable and the thermal power output is stable. The one-dimensional neutronic transport calculation using the discrete ordinate method and burnup calculation using the direct numerical method are carried out to assess the performance of the blanket.

SO GENDER & SOCIETY
LA English

ID FEMINIST ORGANIZATIONS; MOVEMENT; CHALLENGES; GENDER; WORLD
AB During the past two decades, opportunities for women's social movement organizations to expand their scope of engagement have often been accompanied by greater vulnerability to donor discipline and scrutiny. Efforts by activists to accommodate the demands for accountability and institutional sustainability by professionalizing their organizations have been instrumental in moving feminist concerns into the political mainstream. However such institutionalization has frequently contributed to the persistence or creation of social hierarchies within and between women's organizations, as well as to shifts in their social change agendas and action strategies. This article examines the common dilemmas of activists in Latin America and the United States, bringing together two usually separate domains of scholarship to analyze the course, costs, and possibilities of organizational transformation.

AB Tensions over freshwater resources may become more frequent as pressures on water resources grow due to increased demand and variability of rainfall. Conflicts may take place between or within countries or between competing sectoral users. This paper focuses on institutional approaches for enhancing cooperation between countries for sustainable development of transboundary freshwater bodies and contributing basins. It is assumed that instead of being zones of conflict, shared water resources can provide a basis for cooperation and benefit-sharing provided that threats to the international waters are recognized and collaborative structures are created. The paper draws upon experiences gained within the international waters focal area of the Global Environment Facility, the main funding mechanism for countries to support the environmental management of transboundary water resources. Lessons for promoting peaceful cooperation for environmental management, benefit-sharing and sustainable use of transboundary freshwater resources are highlighted through examples from Africa, Central Asia and Latin America. Experience shows the importance of processes that bring together all sectors and actors whose actions affect the transboundary waterbody at regional, national and local levels. The development of a science-based diagnostic analysis is essential to identify the threats to the transboundary ecosystem and to break down the issues into manageable parts with the aim of developing a strategic action programme. Ensuring political commitment that can result in institutional, policy and legal reforms in the countries concerned is the key to sustainable development of the transboundary resource.

TI Medieval and post-medieval glass technology: a review of bracken in
   glassmaking
SO GLASS TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB There is a strong but largely unsubstantiated belief that fern was used throughout Northwest Europe, and to a lesser extent southern Europe, as a source of alkali for the manufacture of potash glass by medieval glassmakers. This is because fern is mentioned in surviving documentary evidence relating to glass production, and Medieval glasshouses in NW Europe were often located in forests and other woodland where ferns grow freely. This paper presents compositional, archaeological and documentary evidence for the use of the fern, bracken, as a source of alkali in medieval and post medieval glassmaking. The most compelling evidence can be found in documentary material but this should be treated with some caution. Nevertheless, cumulatively, these sources suggest tentatively that fern ash may have been used at a number of glassmaking centres throughout Europe. The feasibility of using bracken as a sustainable source of alkali in glassmaking and its glass forming properties will be reported in future papers.

AB A spatial analysis of phytomass carbon (C) in Indian forests for the period (1988-94) at the district-level is reported. District-level forest phytomass C (1988,1994) was computed by combining remote sensing-based forest area inventories on 1:250 000 scale, field inventories of growing stock volume by the Forest Survey of India (FSI), and crown density-based biomass expansion factors. The estimates of forest area inventory, forest phytomass C density, and forest phytomass C pools (1988-94) were linked to the district boundary coverage of India in ARC/INFO Geographic Information System (GIS). Of the total 386 districts examined, only 17 districts had more than 75% forest cover (as percent of their geographic area) in 1988. Estimated district-level forest phytomass C densities ranged from 4.3 to 206.8 MgC ha(-1)*. At the national level, forest phytomass C pool was estimated to be 3871.2 and 3874.3 TgC# in 1988 and 1994, respectively. Although the aggregated national estimates were similar, the district-level change analysis indicated a decrease of 77.8 TgC and an increase of 81 TgC (1988-94). The highest decrease of 10.4 TgC was observed in Vishakapatnam district (Andhra Pradesh) while largest increase of 9.8 TgC in Bastar district (Madhya Pradesh) resulting from deforestation and afforestation activities, respectively. At the national level, the total forest cover decreased by similar to0.6 Mha, however, the district-level spatial analysis indicated an increase of 1.07 Mha, and decrease of 1.65 Mha forest cover during 1988-94 period. Although, this is the first district level phytomass C analysis of Indian forests, the aggregated results at state-level were close to the earlier estimates. The spatial analysis identified the districts that have undergone significant changes in their forest phytomass C during the study period. This improved understanding of forest phytomass C pools is important to sustainable development and conservation of forests, mitigation strategies for C sequestration, and accurate estimation of contribution of land use changes to C emission in India.

ID SUSTAINABILITY; ECONOMY
AB This paper proposes an evolutionary reading of rural development referred to cases of rapid industrial growth, where a strong concentration process has involved the main urban centers and the successful industrial districts. This territorial development pattern has gradually extinguished rural society and its institutional basis, creating a clear separation between new central and peripheral areas. The consequent effects on local economy and social dynamics reveal the long-term risks raised in terms of development sustainability. An empirical study of two Italian provinces is also carried out to show how this framework can be helpful in interpreting real historical patterns.

ID EXERCISE; STAIRS; WOMEN
AB This study aimed to evaluate whether a stair-promoting signed intervention could increase the use of the stairs over the elevator in a health-care facility. A time-series design was conducted over 12 weeks. Data were collected before, during and after displaying a signed intervention during weeks 4-5 and 8-9. Evaluation included anonymous counts recorded by an objective unobtrusive motion-sensing device of people entering the elevator or the stairs. Self-report data on stair use by hospital staff were also collected. Stair use significantly increased after the first intervention phase (P = 0.02), but after the intervention was removed stair use decreased back towards baseline levels. Moreover, stair use did not significantly change after the re-introduction of the intervention. Lastly, stair use decreased below the initial baseline level during the final weeks of evaluation. Furthermore, there was no significant change in self-reported stair use by hospital staff. Therefore, the signed intervention aimed at promoting an increase in incidental physical activity produced small brief effects, which were not maintained. Further research is required to find more effective 'point of choice' interventions to increase incidental physical activity participation with more sustainable impact.

ID ONE-CHILD POLICY; EQUITY
AB Economic migration and growth in informal employment in many of the major cities of developing countries, combined with health sector reforms that are increasingly relying on insurance and out-of-pocket payment, are raising concerns about equity and sustainability of economic and social development.
   In China, the number of internal migrants has dramatically grown since economic transition started in 1980, and maternal health care for these is a pressing issue to be addressed. To provide information for policy-makers and health administrators, a medical records review, a questionnaire survey and qualitative interviews were carried out in Minhang District, Shanghai. This paper describes important inequities in main maternal health outcomes and utilization indicators relating to economic and social transformation of the Chinese society. Analysis of the data collected clarifies that insufficient antenatal care is one of the main determinants for poor maternal health outcomes and that migrants are using antenatal care services significantly less than permanent residents. The data suggest that there is no single explanatory factor, but that migrants are faced with a package of obstacles to accessing health care services, and that health systems may need to rethink and redesign their delivery approaches to specifically target those groups that are faced with such multi-faceted packages of obstacles to service-access. Although the study addresses a specific Chinese phenomenon related to internal migration and registration of residency, parallels can be drawn to other settings where a combination of economic and social transitions of the society and a reform of health care financing are potentially creating the same conditions of significant inequalities.

ID WORKSITE; PARTICIPATION; IMPACT
AB This paper describes a comprehensive evaluation of the organizational impact of a workplace health promotion programme, in the context of a framework devised by Nutbeam in 1998. The Happy Heart at Work programme, sponsored by the Irish Heart Foundation, has been in existence for 10 years and aims to promote a healthy lifestyle through specially devised modular materials. A postal census survey of 785 valid registered sites expressing any level of initial interest in the programme yielded a 40% response rate (n = 311). Of these, 194 (63%) were currently active and 114 were not. Active organizations were less likely to be Irish owned (54.5% versus 71.4%, p < 0.05), and more likely to operate in shifts (72.3% versus 51.1%, p < 0.05) or to have an occupational physician amongst the staff (36.9% versus 31%). Programme impact within active organizations, based on pre-defined Health Promoting Workplace parameters, was documented. There was agreement in the questionnaire responses that participating organizations promote a smoke-free environment (mean rating on five-point scale = 4.42), employee health and well-being (4.21) and good nutritional practice (4.11). Triangulation of research methods, including a telephone survey of gatekeepers from within organizations (n = 18), focus groups with participant employees (n = 42) and a review of the staff opinions of the facilitating organization on the programme, all showed strong concordance with respect to the strengths and weaknesses of Happy Heart at Work. The programme was felt to help improve employees' lifestyle habits and morale, as well as the company's public image. The main drawbacks of the programme were its relatively low profile, even in actively participating organizations, and the fact that it was not seen to be independently sustainable without intensive and ongoing support.

ID HEALTH
AB New technologies and a growing global consciousness have created innovative opportunities for young people to connect locally, nationally and internationally for social action. This paper describes the dynamics of collective action in this new environment. Particular attention is given to how youth social action initiatives use information and communication technologies (ICT) to foster connection, action and sustainability. In-depth interviews were performed with five youths (aged 18-24 years) and two youth workers at two international non-government organizations (NGOs) focusing on social justice and human rights: Global Youth Connect and Amnesty International Canada. Qualitative methods were used to code and analyze the interview tapes and notes. Three main results are discussed: (i) the role of connection in building a youth action movement; (ii) the differential use of various communication technologies; and (iii) access barriers to connection opportunities. ICT enables new and expanded ways of connecting youth to express and share their experiences, which is a key success factor for social action initiatives.

AB Maori continue a centuries old harvest of titi chicks (sooty shearwater, Puffinus griseus) on islands adjacent to Rakiura (Stewart Island). This study measured time limits on the number of Titi taken each day from Putauhinu Island. In the first period of the harvest ("nanao") the chicks are extracted from the breeding burrows during daytime. In the second period of harvest ("rama") the chicks are caught at night after they have emerged from their nesting burrows. Capture rate is much higher during the rama than the nanao. More time is spent processing (plucking, cutting-up, gutting, and packing) chicks during rama than the nanao because of a 1.3-1.7 increase in the number of chicks caught. Recently introduced motorized plucking machines decrease the time required to pluck each chick and make plucking less physically demanding and less painful. However, motorized pluckers did not increase the number of chicks harvested on Putauhinu. Other social limits may control harvest intensity and influence sustainability of muttonbirding.

TI Putting the community back into community-based resource management: A
   criteria and indicators approach to sustainability
SO HUMAN ORGANIZATION

   Canada
AB Advocates of community-based resource management often depict indigenous communities as homogeneous sites of social consensus. While proving successful at advancing local involvement in the management and decision-making process, these idealized images fail to represent the plurality of values and personal interests nested within indigenous communities. By failing to account for internal diversity, indigenous communities that are now regaining management responsibility for their traditional homelands risk furthering the traditional "top-downism" long inherent in institutionalized resource management. However, in regaining these responsibilities, indigenous communities have an opportunity to implement new and locally defined approaches to management. This paper describes one such community-based process and builds upon the experiences of the Little Red River Cree Nation of Alberta, Canada, to illustrate the challenges and opportunities involved. Specifically. through the use of criteria and performance indicators, derived from multiple community perspectives, the Little Red River Cree Nation has developed a self-improving forest management system that is proving responsive to the values, expectations, and changing needs of community members.

AB The development of heat sinks for microelectronic applications, which are compatible with sustainable development, involves the achievement of a subtle balance between a superior thermal design, minimum material consumption, and minimum pumping power. Due to the rapid proliferation of electronic systems, substantial material streams and energy consumption rates are associated with the cooling of computers, as well as other categories of electronic equipment. This presentation explores the potential for the least-energy optimization of natural- and forced-convection cooled rectangular plate heat sinks. The results are evaluated in terms of a heat sink coefficient of performance, relating the cooling capability to the energy invested. Guidelines for "sustainable" heat sink designs are suggested.

AB The livestock keeping forest dwelling communities are viewed by the forestry experts, economists and other agencies as a cause of forest depletion while anthropologists and ecologists have argued that the pastoralists have developed sustainable mode of pasture management based on sound knowledge of forest ecosystem. The arguments in this regard including the relocation of such communities are manifold arid well documented, One such community called Van Guijars who solely, sustain on animal husbandry inside the forest of North India was studied to document their livestock rearing practices mainly. Van Gujjars rear the buffaloes totally on forest grazing and tree fodder lopping. They pay grazing fee to the forest department but it is very, nominal vis-a-vis the area grazed, livestock maintained, trees lopped and earning made by the Van Gujjars through sale of milk and milk products, Moreover the Van Gujjars had no responsibility towards afforestation and maintenance of forest. The relationship of Van Gujars with the forests appeared to tic purely extractive since no arrangement to secure the participation of this community in forest management was in vogue. Whereas. the relocation efforts for this community have so far not met with success, The mechanisms, therefore, need to be evolved effective participation of Van Gujjars is ensured towards sustainability and better productivity of forests along with the socioeconomic and cultural wellbeing of this community since their existence outside forest appears to be a difficult alternative at the moment.

AB Trends of growing consumption, decreasing product lifetime and new application fields in nearly all industry segments lead to an enormous increase of electronics products. The production of raw materials and products, their use as well as the end of life treatment of these products cause considerable environmental impacts. To minimise hazards to human health and the environment, an economic growth in a sense of sustainable development has to be realised and new products and process technologies should proof that they contribute to the solution of global environmental issues.
   In this paper the interconnection technologies as key technologies for future products are discussed in correlation to their environmental behaviour At the present a transition to lead free soldering takes place worldwide. In that respect various environmental aspects of the different lead free interconnection systems (solders and surface finishes) should be compared in order to find the best solution from an ecological point of view.

AB The Venezuelan Land and Agricultural Development Law, dated 1111312001, aims to establish the foundations of integral and sustainable rural development in order to increase the productivity of the land and, moreover to establish equity and fair distribution of the land. Nevertheless, for the Venezuelan private sector the aforementioned law constitutes an expropriation threat that would limit the productive use of the land. However, the main purpose of the law is to develop agricultural production in line with the dietary demands of the Venezuelan population, having as a fundamental premise the elimination of the large estates through the suitable redistribution of the great expanses of land that have remained idle and uncultivated for many years. The purpose of this study is to analyze the scope of some significant aspects of this law, principally those related to the ownership of the land, the type of use made of the land and the security of food production.

AB While the combined forest cover of Small Island Developing States (SIDS) is insignificant in global terms, forests and trees on these islands are extremely important for the wellbeing of the inhabitants. For most of the larger islands, forests also contribute significantly to the national economy and to international trade in wood and non-wood forest products. In addition, forest resources on several islands are of global importance in terms of their role in the conservation of biological diversity, in particular endemic species and genetic variability. As a group, SIDS are well endowed with forests but the extent of forest cover varies greatly among island states. Despite variations in size, location, population density and climatic, geological and topographic conditions, these states share many characteristics which impose particular constraints, but also some which offer unique opportunities, for the sustainable management of their forests and trees.

AB This paper stresses that for many of the Small Island Developing States (SIDS) of the Pacific Ocean, trees outside forests (TOF), perhaps, the single greatest foundation for the life and health of our islands, soils, rivers, beaches, coastlines, people and the constitute. other plants and animals on which we depend. It examines how the protection and planting of TOF and the protection and enrichment of traditional agroforestry systems and associated traditional knowledge can serve as a basis for addressing deforestation, forest degradation, agrodeforestation and the loss of biodiversity. It can further serve as a foundation for biodiversity conservation and sustainable development in the Small Island Developing States of the Pacific Ocean. The nature of traditional Pacific Island agroforestry practices and the diverse range of time-tested species that could form the focus of national and community-based programmes for the protection and planting of TOF are also discussed.

AB The sustainable management of diverse indigenous tree resources is a critical element in the maintenance of livelihoods in rural parts of the South Pacific islands, such as Samoa. Samoa's lowland forests are in a degraded condition as a result of clearing for agricultural crops, intensive logging, severe cyclones and smothering of forest regeneration by the native vine, Merremia peltata. This paper reports on the development of species' conservation and management strategies for two endemic Samoan tree species. Both tree species, Terminalia richii and Mailkara samoensis, are useful timber species but are endangered at the population level. Complementary in situ and ex situ conservation measures are detailed, together with progress in implementing them. The paper also elaborates two general recommendations which are considered important for the conservation of all tree species and to sustainable forest management in Samoa. These strategies were developed by the Forestry Division in consultation with relevant village communities and the support and technical advice of the SPRIG (South Pacific Regional Initiative on Forest Genetic Resources), a regional development assistance project. It is concluded that in Samoa. and other Pacific Island nations, the majority of tree species will need to be conserved in managed native forests and conservation areas, managed by communities with technical advice and support from the relevant Government agencies.

AB The Mankote basin mangrove is the largest mangrove in St. Lucia, covering about 63 ha. It has been used as a source of fuelwood and charcoal since the 18th Century. Since the early 1980s the mangrove has been part of an applied research project testing the effectiveness of a management strategy based on sustainable harvesting for charcoal production and implemented with the active collaboration of the harvesters. Management is based on an agreed set of harvesting practices that serve as rules to be followed by the harvesters and which are intended to maximise regeneration of cut areas. A key element of the apparent success of management has been the agreement of sole access rights granted to the charcoal producers group and their sustainable prescriptive harvesting and surveillance functions supported by the management strategy endorsed by the relevant agencies. within a policy context set by the St. Lucian government that has favoured protection and permitted the delegation of management authority.

AB The island of the Commonwealth of Dominica is endowed with an abundance of natural beauty and biodiversity. The island's mountainous terrain, abundant rainfall, clear mountain streams, lush forests and unique species of flora and fauna put it in an advantageous position as an ecotourist destination within the eastern Caribbean islands, and within the Caribbean as a whole. Approximately 65%, of Dominica is covered with natural vegetation, including the most extensive area of rain forest on any of the Lesser Antillean islands. In recent years there has been a rapid growth in tourism development, based mainly on the island's natural attractions. For the period of 1989 to 1993, Dominica achieved the highest annual increase in visitor expenditure among the Caribbean islands. The economic future of Dominica is very dependent on the management and sustainability of its natural resources.

SO INTERNATIONAL GEOLOGY REVIEW

ID HEALTH
AB For more than 3.5 billion years, the Earth's biosphere maintained a dynamic equilibrium with solar energy and natural materials derived from the near-surface lithosphere, hydrosphere, and atmosphere. Beginning about 10,000 years ago, however, settled agriculture allowed the division of labor, rise of civilizations, and utilization of terrestrial resources at rates greater than those of replenishment. Demographic estimates put our numbers at 9-10 billion by 2050. About 85 percent of humanity now resides in the Developing Nations, and this proportion is growing. Due to the global information network, this is the first world generation to become acutely aware of the high standard of living confined to the Industrialized Nations. The grossly inequitable distribution of wealth, due partly to Earth resource exploitation, is resented by many people of the Developing Nations; this situation is politically destabilizing and must be ameliorated.
   But can 10 billion people be afforded comfortable lives without destroying the planetary carrying capacity and habitability through exhaustion of the Earth's natural capital? Humans now control a third of the terrestrial net primary biological production, and our share is increasing. Adverse environmental impacts include increasing air and water pollution; accelerating loss of biodiversity, ecosystem services, topsoil, fisheries, and tropical rain forests; and global warming + sea-level rise. Prospects for the intricate web of life are ominous. Modem societies are sustained by the extraction of fossil energy, water, and other Earth materials far exceeding planetary renewal rates. Island communities provide sobering examples of the collapse of cultures that have overexploited and devastated their environments. Thus, humanity must reach a steady-state stewardship of the planet involving super-efficient, universal mineral resource recovery and conservation while preserving ecosystem integrity. Utilization of renewable resources at or below recharge rates and near-total recycling of nonrenewable Earth materials can only be accomplished employing widely available, inexpensive energy. Unfortunately, the Second Law of Thermodynamics dictates that a portion of the mineral resources and most of the spent energy are irretrievably lost. Scientific research-generated technological advances providing production and ubiquitous availability of low-environmental-impact, cheap energy will be essential to preserving anything approaching steady-state resource utilization.
   Assuming technical, economic, and political success in achieving global equity and prosperity for 10 billion people (a very large order indeed!), the world ecosystem will be severely compromised through increased human consumption of the Earth's mineral resources. Biospheric equilibrium and ecosystem sustainability-the very carrying capacity of the planet-is already at risk, and this risk is increasing. Without doubt, the greatest long-term challenge facing humanity involves the preservation of a functioning, viable biosphere.

ID AQUIFER MANAGEMENT
AB Principles of sustainable ground-water exploitation are presented in this paper. The renewable and inappropriable nature of ground water is examined in light of the process of recharge. An example illustrates the interplay among ground-water extraction, recharge, natural recharge, and storage. It demonstrates the aquifer-specific characteristics of overdraft and replenishment, which are driven by climatic variability and the rate of ground-water mining. A second example uses game theoretic methodology to quantify the roles of cooperation and non-cooperation on ground-water extraction. The economic and environmental advantages of cooperative ground-water extraction are demonstrated with data from a coastal aquifer.

AB An overarching challenge of the 21st century is the pursuit of an economically equitable balance between an exponentially expanding human system on planet Earth and the finite system of renewable natural resources supporting that human system. The combination of rapidly growing human knowledge and revolutionary technologies for sharing knowledge provides an effective tool for addressing; (1) population growth and (2) gains in individual economic productivity that are driving expansion of the human system. An environmentally sustainable, economically equitable, and socially stable global society is within reach as an array of local and regional communities possessing those characteristics. Western Hemisphere Knowledge Partnerships offer an attractive way to demonstrate the potential of The Knowledge Age to mount an international response to this 21st century challenge.

AB Objective. To develop a framework to support the institutionalization of quality assurance (QA).
   Design. The framework for institutionalizing QA consists of a model of eight essential elements and a 'roadmap' for the process of institutionalization. The essential elements are the building blocks required for implementing and sustaining QA activities. Core QA activities include defining, measuring and improving quality. The essential elements are grouped under three categories: the internal enabling environment (internal to the organization or system), organizing for quality, and support functions. The enabling environment contains the essential elements of leadership, policy, core values, and resources. Organizing for quality includes the structure for implementing QA. Three essential elements are primarily support functions: capacity building, communication and information, and rewarding quality The model can be applied at the level of an organization or a system. The paper also describes the process of institutionalizing QA, starting from a state of preawareness, passing through four phases (awareness, experiential, expansion, and consolidation), and culminating in a state of maturity. The process is not linear; an organization may regress, vacillate between phases, or even remain stagnant. Some phases (e.g. awareness and experiential) may occur simultaneously.
   Conclusion. The framework has been introduced in nearly a dozen countries in Latin America and Africa. The conceptual model has been used to support strategic planning and directing Ministry of Health work plans, and also as a resource for determining the elements necessary to strengthen and sustain QA. The next step will be the development and evaluation of an assessment tool to monitor developmental progress in the institutionalization of QA.

AB Objective. The Chilean quality assurance (QA) program evaluation took place in July 1999, at the request of the Chilean Ministry of Health. The main objectives of the evaluation were to identify key aspects of the 8-year-old Chilean QA program that could be considered by other countries and to make strategic recommendations.
   Setting. In 1991, the Ministry of Health of Chile launched a national QA program. A national-level team initiated countrywide training of health care providers in QA skills, the development of quality committees at facility levels to direct local quality improvement activities, and training of quality monitors to provide technical support for training and quality improvement activities.
   Design. The evaluation team, consisting of two international consultants and a regional consultant from the Costa Rican Ministry of Health, visited six regions and seven health 'servicios' (geographically defined administrative units within a region). The regions and servicios were purposefully chosen to represent different geographic areas, types of facilities, and levels of performance of QA activities. The evaluation was based on a framework developed and applied by the Quality Assurance Project (Center for Human Services, USA). Group and individual interviews with staff complemented document and record reviews.
   Results. The evaluation team found that Chile's QA program had been successful in achieving sustainability and institutionalization. Factors contributing to this success included the enabling environment, management and leadership, technical functions, and support functions.
   Conclusion. The Chilean QA program constitutes an interesting experience for consideration by other countries. Key features include its sustainability, nationwide coverage, decentralization, and alliance of quality improvement and regulation. Training results are impressive: almost 20% of Ministry of Health personnel received training, and 19 training modules are in use. Coaches are active and technically sustaining quality assurance activities nationwide.

AB The failure of many B2C companies has triggered widespread concern about the future prospects of such firms. Surviving and newly formed companies are reevaluating their strategies and struggling to build a sustainable business model. This paper empirically examines how customer value created through Web site interface and advertising affects firm performance in an electronic commerce context. Advertising can increase the number of visitors to a Web site. Web site features that facilitate presale, sale, and postsale tasks by increasing visitor-to-customer conversion can augment bottom-line performance measured in terms of economic value added (EVA). The results demonstrate that advertising spending alone has only a negligible impact on firm performance. A more appropriate profit-enhancing strategy for B2C companies is to complement advertising spending with a superior shopping experience that augments the value customers gain from the purchase experience. Advertising spending may act as a stimulus to increase Web site traffic. If complemented with Web site features that support customers' purchase-requirements determination and product-ownership experience, it can enhance the performance of B2C firms.

The principles of sustainable development have been publicly endorsed at the highest political level in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR). However, the SAR stills lacks a sustainable development strategy and has not officially adopted Agenda 21. Nor have any serious attempts been made to embed sustainable development within civil society. Nonetheless, the Government of the HKSAR is beginning to put in place institutional structures to handle sustainability concerns within the policy-making process.
   Given the ambivalence towards sustainable development in Hong Kong and uncertainty about what it entails, a policy shift towards an ecological modernisation position may find a more receptive audience among local decision-makers and the business community. This paper discusses some of the barriers to the pursuit of sustainable development in Hong Kong but argues that there are now opportunities for a shift towards a new set of policies consistent with ecological modernisation. Such a shift may be seen as a transitional stage in progress towards the formulation and adoption of a more comprehensive framework for sustainability issues in the future. Although we indicate limited action to date, ecological modernisation does provide a path not necessarily inconsistent with the economic aspirations of Hong Kong and may be a useful model to follow in much of the rest of Asia.

AB Industrial ecology is an approach to industrial development which emphasizes material cycling and webs of producers, consumers, scavengers and decomposers, and encourages resource conservation and waste prevention that leads to improved efficiency, competitiveness and sustainability. This article first introduces the functions and roles of scavengers and decomposers in the natural ecosystem. Then, by using this natural system metaphor, it studies how the industrial world can realize closing loop operation by encouraging the development of scavenger and decomposer businesses. A case study of Burnside Industrial Park is employed to further help the reader understand how to analyze the roles and functions of different businesses in an industrial system.

DT Article
DE land-use change; agro-pastoral production; sustainable development;
   remote sensing; geographical information systems
AB The study is focused on land use in agro-pastoral production in Ogun State. Using a combination of data from ethno-social surveys, remote sensing and geographical information systems (GIS), the study has characterized the overall agro-pastoral production system, with emphasis on population, land use and herd productivity.
   It was found that yields of arable crops on agro-pastoralists' fields were generally low due, perhaps, to the low genetic potentials of seed varieties used, poor soil conditions and poor land management practices. Livestock productivity was similar on all parameters to levels in similar contexts elsewhere across the West African sub-region but generally below possible potentials and research station findings. Much of the land cover had been considerably altered around the areas of pastoral household settlements compared with the situation 20 years ago. Agro-pastoral households currently use between 221 km(2) and 523 km(2) of land in Ogun State. Pastoral grazing orbits extend beyond the boundaries of the State in the northeastern areas and beyond the boundaries of the country into the Republic of Benin in the northwest. These areas represent potential conflict areas between crop farmers and agro-pastoralists. There was a direct and positive relationship between population density in pastoral household settlements and the area of land disturbed. It was recommended that there was a need for deliberate land-use planning intervention by government to ensure long-term peaceful co-existence of farmers and agro-pastoral producers. It was concluded that further studies should focus on establishing a clear link between the land-use practices of agro-pastoralists and their specific effects on soil conditions, ecological succession and the overall farming systems.

AB Integrated natural resources management (INRM) has to address both the livelihood goals of farmers and the ecological sustainability of agro-ecosystems and natural resources. Under the Ecoregional Initiative for the Humid and Sub-Humid Tropics of Asia - Ecor(I)Asia - one major set of activities has been the development of approaches, methodologies, and tools to meet the challenges of INRM research for sustainable agricultural development. Examples provided illustrate the role of these methodologies in the three main phases of knowledge development for improving INRM impact: knowledge generation, knowledge capitalization, and knowledge mobilization. The methodologies are designed for better integration across disciplines, spatial scales, and hierarchical levels of social organization. Attempts are made to quantify trade-offs between biophysical sustainability and socio-economic considerations. The case is made for using these methodologies in a more complementary manner to help bridge the top-down and bottom-up approaches in INRM. Inherent in the developing and implementing of these methodologies is the forging of partnerships and fostering linkages with multiple stakeholders, as well as using the knowledge base and integrative tools as communication platforms.

AB This paper addresses the critical situation of water resource exploitation for agriculture and environmental effects in Ningjin County in the North China Plain. Several negative environmental effects such as declining groundwater table levels, decline in groundwater quality, increased irrigation cost, increased soil salinity, compaction of soil, increased land subsidence and increased incidence of waterlogging have been experienced in the area, as perceived by the local farmers. This is due to overpumping of groundwater by a large number of wells clustered in small areas. The study indicates that if the current pattern of groundwater use, existing attitudes of farmers and improper implementation of policies and regulations is continued, the agricultural activities will face severe consequences and tend to be unsustainable. This warrants new strategies to improve the present situation.

ID DYNAMICS
AB Controversies surrounding the appropriate use and diffusion of agricultural biotechnologies are giving rise to questions about governance at the international level. This article investigates the likelihood that a single, international regime or multiple regimes governing this technology will form by way of negotiation. We show that four normative-institutional arrangements, organized around distinct general principles, have a potential governance role: world food security and safety, liberalized trade, protection of intellectual property, and conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity. We argue that an adequate amount of compatibility between the principles and norms of these arrangements is required to support the type of communicative action or truth-seeking needed to develop the intersubjective understanding for a regime. Using a framework for assessing normative compatibility, we find not one, but two nascent understandings rooted in the trade and biodiversity areas competing to form the foundation for governance. Further analysis of levels of institutional density between the two developing regimes reveals they are presently too low to support a negotiated resolution of normative conflict. Finally, we demonstrate that recent framing attempts at the international level to decrease areas of tension and incompatibility in principles/norms between the regimes have neglected to create the crucial normative background conditions needed to avert a scenario of increased political conflict in the near future.

SO IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE

DE subsurface drainage; salinity; costs of drainage; benefits of drainage;
   economic feasibility; sustainability
AB The sustainability of irrigated agriculture in India is threatened by waterlogging, soil salinity and alkalinity. To reverse declining agricultural productivity, a combination of surface and subsurface drainage, supplemented by improved irrigation management, has been identified as the most appropriate strategy. But drainage for salinity control is costly. Therefore, the benefits in terms of sustained agricultural production must be thoroughly investigated to establish its techno-economic feasibility. The present study attempts to do this by analysing: (i) the cost of installing subsurface drainage, (ii) the direct on-farm benefits of subsurface drainage, and (iii) the financial feasibility of subsurface drainage.
   Haryana State was selected as the site of the study. The study shows that, after the installation of drainage, land utilization intensified as a sizeable area of formerly fallow land was brought under cultivation. It also shows that the cropping pattern changed in favour of more remunerative crops and that crop yields increased. This is an indication of the immediate gain from drainage, which helps to increase land productivity, gainful employment of the farmers and, hence, farm income. Recently (1997-98), mechanically installed large-scale drainage development in the framework of the Indo-Dutch Haryana Operational Pilot Project (HOPP) also supported the above findings. Given a sustainable solution for the disposal of the drainage effluent, the financial feasibility of drainage in waterlogged and saline areas looks favourable, provided that sufficient water is available for leaching and irrigation.

DE irrigation; drainage; sustainable development; networking system
AB One critical problem confronting mankind today is how to manage the intensifying competition for water between expanding urban centres, traditional agricultural activities and in-stream water uses dictated by environmental concerns. In the agricultural sector, the dwindling number of economically attractive sites for large-scale irrigation and drainage projects limits the prospects of increasing the gross cultivated area. Therefore, the required increase in agricultural production will necessarily rely largely on a more accurate estimation of crop water requirements on the one hand, and on major improvements in the construction, operation, management and performance of existing irrigation and drainage systems, on the other. The failings of present systems and the inability to sustainably exploit surface and groundwater resources can be attributed essentially to poor planning, design, system management and development. This is partly due to the inability of engineers, planners and managers to adequately quantify the effects of irrigation and drainage projects on water resources and to use these effects as guidelines for improving technology, design and management.
   To take full advantage of investments in agriculture, a major effort is required to modernize irrigation and drainage systems and to further develop appropriate management strategies compatible with the financial and socio-economic trends, and the environment. This calls for a holistic approach to irrigation and drainage management and monitoring so as to increase food production, conserve water, prevent soil salinization and waterlogging, and to protect the environment. All this requires, among others, enhanced research and a variety of tools such as water control and regulation equipment, remote sensing, geographic information systems, decision support systems and models, as well as field survey and evaluation techniques. To tackle this challenge, we need to focus on the following issues:
   affordability with respect to the application of new technologies
   procedures for integrated planning and management of irrigation and drainage systems;
   analysis to identify causes and effects constraining irrigation and drainage system performance;
   evapotranspiration and related calculation methods;
   estimation of crop water requirements;
   technologies for the design, construction and modernization of irrigation and drainage systems;
   strategies to improve irrigation and drainage system efficiency;
   environmental impacts of irrigation and drainage and measures for creating and maintaining sustainability;
   institutional strengthening, proper financial assessment, capacity building, training and education. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

ID SALT TOLERANCE; IRRIGATION; WATER
AB Waterlogging and salinity are the major threats to the sustainability of irrigated agriculture in Pakistan. About 50% of the Culturable Command Area (CCA) in the Fordwah Eastern Sadiqia South (FESS) is affected by waterlogging and 12% by surface and profile salinity. A sample of 26 watercourses was selected in the project area to evaluate the individual and combined impacts of waterlogging and salinity on the yields of cotton, wheat, sugarcane and rice. The crop yields were measured separately for waterlogged fields and those affected with salinity and waterlogging simultaneously. The extent of yield loss as result of a rise in the water table from 1-2 m to less than 1 m was 27 and 33% for wheat and sugarcane crops, whereas it was 7 and 6% in the case of a drop of the water table to more than 2 m. For cotton, a rising water table from 2-3 m to 1-2 m and less than 1 m gave a yield decrease of about 11 and 60% respectively. The rice crop preferred waterlogging, and in contrast to Other crops, gave about 7% less yield with a lowering of the water table from less than I m to 1-2 m. The wheat and sugarcane yields had decreasing trends with salinity in excess of 4 dS m(-1) and had complete failures with salinity greater than 12 dS m-1 at water table depths of less than 1, 1-2 and 2-3 m. The cotton crop demonstrated relatively higher salinity tolerance under a water table deeper than I m. However, this crop could not survive at salinity levels in excess of 12 dS m(-1) at water table depth of less than 1 m. The rice crop was a complete failure at salinity level of greater than 12 dS m(-1) under water table depths of less than I and 1-2 m. The combined impact of waterlogging and salinity was more harmful to crop yields when compared with the individual effects of waterlogging. The combined analysis of waterlogging and salinity on crop yields provide a good sensitivity of the salinity-yield relationships and indicated the importance of subsurface drainage.

AB This paper addresses the long-term sustainability of the growth effects from trade, within the context of a dynamic optimization model where the investment sector exhibits an initial phase of increasing returns. If is proved that the qualitative properties of trade and growth remain valid, even for decreasing, rather than constant, returns to scale in the consumption sector. That is, trade enables an economy to escape a "poverty trap" and enjoy unbounded growth. Moreover, the asymptotic long-run growth rate of the optimal consumption levels with trade is determined, establishing that trade has a beneficial effect on long-run growth. .

ID NORTHERN SYRIA
AB In crop rotation trials, the errors arising over time on the same plot are correlated. Often-used analyses assume zero or constant correlation between the errors while the actual covariance structure for the plot errors might be very different. The objective of this study was to identify the most suitable covariance structure and incorporate the error structure in assessment of the crop rotations in terms of yield productivity and yield sustainability. A set of five covariance structures were examined for barley yield data from a 14-year, two-course barley rotation trial conducted at two locations in northern Syria. Selection of the covariance structures was based on the Akaike information criterion (AIC, Akaike 1974) (a function of penalized log-likelihood) obtained from fitting the structure. Covariance structure with heterogeneous variances and with constant correlation between errors over cycles within the same plot was found to account for most variability in grain and straw yields at both locations. Modeling data with this covariance structure, the legume rotations gave higher productivity as well as higher annual increases compared with the continuous barley system. This implies that an agricultural production system based on a legume following a cereal is likely to be more sustainable for cereal production compared to cereal followed by cereals.

Water rationing was in place in Tehran and other cities, and large proportions of the country's crops and livestock were perishing. Yet many academics and other experts in Iran insist that the water crisis is only partly drought-related, and claim that mismanagement of water resources is the more significant cause. Underlying this discussion is a complex of overlapping yet often conflicting ethical systems - Iranian, Islamic, and modernist/industrialist - which are available to inform water policy in Iran. A review of the various arguments about the nature of the crisis and the range of solutions that have been proposed, including precedents from traditional Iranian water management and the ethics of water use in Islamic law, suggests that Iran's own cultural heritage provides alternatives to wholesale adoption of Western models.

SO JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE

ID SEQUENCES
AB Field experiments were conducted at the Crop Research Centre of Govind Ballabh Pant University of Agriculture and Technology, Pantnagar during 1996/97 and 1997/98. Each experiment comprised 10 crop sequences: (a) wheat-rice, (b) chickpea-rice, (c) lentil-rice, (d) pea-rice, (e) wheat-mungbean green manure-rice, (f) wheat-Sesbania green manure-rice, (g) wheat-fodder-rice, (h) chickpea-fodder rice, (i) lentil-fodder-rice and (j) pea-fodder-rice, in a randomized block design with four replications. The crop sequences were compared in terms of economic rice equivalent yield (REY), protein production, apparent nutrient balances and effect on soil fertility status. Amongst crop sequences involving two crops each year (200 % cropping intensity), chickpea-rice gave highest REY and protein production. Of the sequences involving three crops each year (300 % cropping intensity), chickpea-fodder-rice and wheat-fodder rice were superior to others. The P balances were positive for all sequences, whereas K balances were generally negative except for sequences involving green manure legumes. Green manuring with Sesbania or mungbean helped restore soil fertility, indicating the advantage of green manure for higher productivity and sustainability of rice-wheat system. Chickpea-rice and chickpea-fodder-rice appeared promising alternatives to rice-wheat crop sequence.

TI Nature's concept. The 'New agriculture' amidst ecology, economy and the
   demythologization of the gene
SO JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY AND CROP SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
ID CONSEQUENCES; RESISTANCE
AB From worldwide discussions about the limits of agriculture has arisen a powerful vision of sustainable development. Phrases like 'limitation', 'sustainability', 'sufficient supply', 'fair distribution' and 'productivity of resources' are no longer hindrances but guidelines for a fairer and safer world. 'Nature's Concept' focuses on biological and ecological principles. On this basis, criteria of action have to be defined in order to determine long-term economic consequences of agri-production. The costs of destruction of natural resources, such as reduction of genetic resources, changes to the world climate and soil degradation, are inestimably large. The long-term effects show the real substance of the agri-shift and the demands on research. The solution for sustainable agriculture is more than ever a scientific development of 'tools' for a sensible management of resources. Gene technology may be an option to reduce the ecological risks of agriculture, especially those of devastating land use. For this purpose, new education programmes with international links and interventions by states are crucial in order to solve conflicts when short-term interests interfere with long-term ecological values. The international agri-centres could have a further impact to guarantee access to new techniques for all countries. Thus agriculture could finally become a major pillar in a fair world order.

TI The moral life of trees: Pastoral farming and production forestry in
   northern New Zealand
SO JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID RURAL COMMUNITIES
AB For the first time in the history of production forestry in northern New Zealand, forests are being planted on "good farmland." In this article we analyze conflicting narratives of sustainability in relation to this change, using concepts from Zizek (1993, 1997) and Hage (1998). We argue that forestry presents a threat to the identity of pastoral farmers as the backbone of the country, to their enjoyment of community, and to their sense of themselves as national managers and, further, that pastoral farmers can symbolize Pakeha (white New Zealanders). This threat is exacerbated because the recent growth in forestry includes considerable Maori involvement and coincides with Maori return to rural tribal lands. In addition, the multinational nature of forestry calls the bounded nation itself into question. Our evidence is drawn from ethnographic and other research in the late 1990s.

ID ACIPENSER
AB Illegal fishing for sturgeons in both river and sea environments has increased the difficulty for sturgeon hatcheries to obtain spawners. This has resulted in reduced hatchery output for stocking in the Caspian and Azov seas. Long-term holding of wild broodstocks, with repeated spawning in the hatcheries, is one possible solution to the problem. From 1997 to 2001, 105 female Russian sturgeon ( Acipenser gueldenstaedtii) were spawned at the Volgograd Sturgeon Hatchery using a surgical technique for egg removal. Seventy-four ( 71%) females survived until the spring of 2001. Five females that spawned in 1997 matured again in 2001, with four of them producing eggs of high quality. These results indicate the potential for a captive bloodstock programme that will assure continuity of hatchery operation, independent of the availability of spawners from the wild.

   basin management; nutrient emissions; Rhine
AB Management of river basins involves the making of informed choices about the desired levels of economic activities and ecosystem functioning in the catchment. Information on the economic and ecological effects of measures as well as their spatial distribution is therefore needed. This paper proposes the following instruments to support decision-making in river basins: (1) the linking of models and indicators to describe the economic and ecological effects of management actions and their spatial distribution and (2) an extended evaluation framework that aims to evaluate management actions on three objectives for sustainable river management. These are cost-effectiveness, spatial equity, and environmental quality. This paper illustrates the potential of these instruments for river basin management by a case-study on nutrient management in the Rhine basin. In this case-study four nutrient abatement strategies are formulated, based on policies of the International Commission for the Protection of the Rhine and the North Sea Commission. These strategies are analysed and evaluated on their contribution to the three management objectives. Results show that none of these strategies score highest on cost-effectiveness, spatial equity and environmental quality simultaneously. It appears that cost-effectiveness is in conflict with environmental quality, whereas spatial equity and cost-effectiveness show quite close correspondence. This means that a trade-off has to be made between costs and spatial equity on the one hand, and environmental standards on the other hand. This paper offers a framework to make these trade-offs more explicit and provides quantitative information on cause-effect relationships, economic and environmental effects and the spatial distribution of these effects for various management strategies. This information can be particularly useful in the development of compromises required to establish international agreement and co-operation. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB In recent decades, following the cleanup in the 1960s, the Thames Estuary has become a major nursery ground for economic and conservation species, and has seen the development of substantial commercial and recreational fisheries. The Environment Agency has both sea fisheries and freshwater fisheries statutory powers in the estuary. A unique and focussed survey programme has been developed to inform management policies. A Fisheries Management Action Plan has been developed to promote integrated salmonid, eel Anguilla anguilla and sea fisheries management, promote nurseries, sustainable exploitation and habitat protection and enhancement. Data are used to influence water quality, water resources and flood defence management regimes and in the planning field to influence development proposals. Consensus and collaboration have been built through the Thames Estuary Partnership. Research aims identified through the Thames Estuary Research Forum are described together with future pressures on key species. The survey rationales being developed will contribute to new standard sampling strategies and classification scheme to meet the requirements of the E.U. Water Framework Directive.

AB This paper critiques three prominent information systems (IS) contributions to the development of social (work) systems, namely ETHICS, UTOPIA and Multiple Perspectives. They are based on the sociotechnical Quality of Working Life and generally rely on systems design for improving working conditions by allowing employees to appreciate a holistic work experience, instead of being treated as a cog in the profit-making machinery of capitalism. However, this paper argues that ETHICS and Multiple Perspectives in fact shy away from the ideo-political differences that cause workplace conflict in the first place. Their pluralist means of resolving workplace conflicts through discussion and negotiation fail to problematize the colonizing or hegemonic influence of economic rationalism in obscuring the feasibility of alternative modes of workplace relations, They play down the asymmetrical power relations that perpetuate the exploitation of weaker stakeholders in real-life employment negotiations. Hence, political quietism in social IS approaches fail to acknowledge the ideological causes of conflict, that is the pursuit of profit at any cost, as opposed to a more sustainable and ethical approach to workplace relations. This paper presents a study of an organizational accounting IS system and uses it for illustrating the ideological roots of differences in employee-employer needs and priorities and revealing how reflexive decision makers are alienated when they attempt to distance themselves from the myopic ethos of economic rationalism. Despite these criticisms, the paper concludes on a relatively positive note. It argues that, since the Brundtland Commission report Our Common Future was released in 1987, there has been increased awareness that organizations cannot continue to exploit our resources (and ourselves) blatantly in the name of profit maximization. This process of redefinition opens the door for more realistic and politically challenging systems approaches.

AB Desalination of whey is an important process in food technology and can be done either by electrodialysis (ED) or-by ion exchange (IE) resins. The aim of the present paper is an assessment of the cumulative energy demand of both processes for a technical plant including production of the regeneration agents for the ion exchangers and treatment of waste water. A flow of 45 m(3) per day of nanofiltered whey, which is three times concentrated and partially desalted, is assumed as feed for the plant. Data for the assessment was obtained from own laboratory experiments to be reported here, as well as from commercial plants. Applying IE, the final whey product is desalted to a degree of 99%. The IE process yields 3.7 m(3) of waste water with 36.3 kg ash and an organic charge of 26 kg chemical oxygen demand (COD)/m(3) feed whey. The energy demand of IE amounts to 0.15 kWh for pumping, 25.33 kWh for the production of the regenerants, and 9.75 kWh for the reduction of the organic charge/m(3) whey. With ED, the final whey product is desalted to only 90%. ED yields 1.25 m(3) of waste water with 8.1 kg ash and an organic charge of 8.4 kg COD/m(3) whey. The energy demand of ED amounts to 4.2 kWh for pumping, 5.38 kWh for the electric current through the ED cells, and 3.16 kWh for the reduction of the organic charge/m(3) whey.

AB Supplementation with carotene-rich fruits may be an effective and sustainable approach to prevent vitamin A deficiency. To test the effectiveness of mango supplementation, 176 Gambian children, aged 2 to 7 y, were randomly assigned to one of four treatments: 75 g of dried mango containing similar to150 mug retinol activity equivalents with (MF) or without (M) 5 g of fat, 5 d/wk for 4 mo or 60,000 mug of vitamin A (A) or placebo (P) capsule at baseline. After 4 mo, plasma beta-carotene was greater in both the M (P < 0.05) and MF (P = 0.07) groups compared with the P group. After controlling for baseline plasma retinol, elevated acute phase proteins and age, plasma retinol concentrations in the A and MF, but not M, groups were higher than in the P group at the end of the study (P < 0.01). Increases in retinol concentrations, however, were small in both groups. These results support the use of dietary supplementation with dried mangoes and a source of fat as one of several concurrent strategies that can be used to help maintain vitamin A status of children in developing countries where there is a severe seasonal shortage of carotenoid-rich foods.

AB A train-the-trainer intervention, based on the World Health Organization's Safe Motherhood Initiative, was successful in changing some health beliefs and health practices among village men and women of childbearing age in a remote area of Uganda. Specifically, more villagers reported attending postpartum care and beginning prenatal care earlier in pregnancy. Some beliefs were not changed (eg, belief in bewitchment), but some beliefs (eg, use of herbal medicines during labor) were not as widely held as a result of this cost-effective and easily sustainable program.

SO JOURNAL OF URBAN PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT

AB Urban governments show considerable interest in formulating policies for a more sustainable transportation sector. In Australia, despite the Commonwealth Government Ecologically Sustainable Development (ESD) Transport Working Group making over 40 recommendation,, for more sustainable urban transportation a decade ago, a recent Institution of Engineers Australia, Transport Panel found little progress with transportation indicators of sustainability and appropriate analytical techniques. A review of the international literature is made to determine definitions of a sustainable urban transportation and land use system, and objectives that would form the basis for determining suitable indicators of performance. Drawing on hierarchical diagrams from decision theory, we show the link between higher-level policy objectives for sustainability and lower-order actions, measurable attributes, and performance indicators. The analytical framework for sustainable urban transportation analysis includes descriptive statistics-exploratory and graphical methods, spatial mapping, spatial statistics (to identify geographical patterns and to identify outliers in the data), regression analysis, travel preference functions based on Stoufler's intervening opportunity model, and linear programming. These analytical techniques are illustrated with examples of travel and urban form in Sydney using data from the Census of Population and Housing, 1961-1996. The need for geographically based indicators and transportation and land use policies is emphasized.

AB This paper adopts the World Bank's 1996 definition of sustainable transportation and attempts to identify ways of improving, the urban transportation planning process and methodology. After a literature review of related studies conducted in different parts of the world over the past decade or so, the major theoretical and methodological advances in stated preference (SP) surveys are summarized. Then, the paper continues to suggest ways of how SP techniques can be used side-by-side with the traditional four-stage transportation planning model. Lastly, it concludes with sonic future directions of change if these useful techniques are to play a more important role in planning for sustainable urban transportation.

SO MARINE TECHNOLOGY SOCIETY JOURNAL

AB Renewable energy sources from the oceans include offshore wind, wave energy, and underwater currents. Sustainable future economies require renewable energy sources. Recent developments in ocean-based renewable energy systems are outlined and forecasts for the next decade are put forth. Offshore wind energy is the fastest growing sector in renewable energy. Anticipated to reach $ 6 billion per year in Europe by 2006, upwards of 86 MW of capacity from 88 turbines are in place today. Capacity by 2010 is projected to grow to at least 2000 MW. Governmental support in Europe is fueling the development, in part, because of greenhouse gas emission targets. The first commercial-scale wave power facility was established in Scotland. Several proponents plan prototype demonstrations over the next few years. Growth in this sector is anticipated to reach $100 million per annum by 2010. Projects harnessing tidal currents have shifted toward capturing tidal-driven coastal currents. Conservative estimates of $40 million per annum by 2010 appear realistic. Ocean-based renewable energy development lag land-based systems because of significant capital requirements and difficulty obtaining the necessary financing due to risk and market barriers. The technical capabilities, both in engineering and management, exist in the offshore sector to undertake the size and scope of projects envisioned.

DE measuring soil sustainability; non-linear principal component analysis;
   soil conservation strategies; cluster analysis
AB This paper presents a new methodology for measuring the adoption of sustainable agricultural practices that attempts to integrate positive features of earlier approaches. It measures the degree of sustainability observed by the farmer and, at the same time, is straightforward and efficient in field-by-field appraisals. The methodology proposed starts with the identification of all available soil conservation practices in the area. The practices are then grouped into activity categories and are ranked within each category on the basis of their expected soil conservation effect on the plot system. The resulting ranking system is applied to each plot included in the analysis. Non-linear principal component analysis is carried out on the plot rankings to extract a limited number of major metric components.
   The method is applied to the Cabuyal watershed in Colombia. The analysis shows that soil management strategies of Cabuyal farmers consist of different combinations of basic soil conservation practices: soil disturbance control, soil protection practices and run-off control. A cluster analysis of the plot scores on these three combinations revealed that the different strategies of soil management are related to the institutional, economic, physical and personal-social factors affecting farms and farmers. The results from the cluster analysis show the usefulness of the proposed methodology for policy purposes.

AB After a series of demonstration projects, otolaryngology has begun to demonstrate clinical efficacy for telemedicine and is showing sustainability. Filling a need is the single most important factor in determining success, and those areas with the most need (eg, areas of geographic or social isolation) have been most successful. Recent legislation has improved reimbursement, while other legislation has added increased security requirements for the transmission of patient information. Equipment and transmission costs have dropped dramatically, but cost effectiveness has generally been demonstrated only when patient transportation or time away from work is calculated. Telemedicine programs that have adopted the principles of successful business models have had the greatest success.

TI Empowerment of women on an agricultural research farm in India: a
   success story
SO OUTLOOK ON AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
DE agricultural research farm; change management; empowerment; farm women
AB At the heart of all research activities in agriculture lies the huge power of human resources, which helps to galvanize scientists into action. This disorganized force of workers, called the labour force, comprises both men and women to be employed on an equitable basis. As in other areas of work, women working on the farm have certain stereotyped roles in an otherwise supposedly non-gender-specific domain. This paper looks into the presumptions, problems and prospects of these neglected, but essential women workers on agricultural research farms. It highlights the experiences and issues that have emerged from a novel experiment involving the empowerment of farm women. In the case presented, empowerment was achieved through a threefold strategic approach. This involved education to promote positive self-image and self-confidence, skills development, and creating an awareness of social change. Various initiatives were promoted on a sustained basis to bring about the change process. These included adult literacy programmes, payment of wages to individuals through their bank accounts, on-site skills development and training, participation of workers in decision-making meetings to develop action plans and set targets for their respective areas of work, acquisition of gender-friendly equipment, health campaigns, etc. All these brought about gradual but perceptible changes in their attitudes and behaviour. The result of this empowerment process was reflected in enhanced qualitative and quantitative outcomes. A crucial factor in the success and sustainability of this empowerment process was the support and visionary outlook of top management. The lessons from this case study can serve as motivating factors for other agricultural institutions to experiment.

AB Nonchemical methods including host resistance, organic amendments, crop rotation, soil solarization, and cultural practices have been used to control soilborne pests in fresh market vegetable production systems. Their suitability as alternatives to methyl bromide will depend on the approach to pest management used by the grower. Traditionally, methyl bromide is used in production systems that rely on the single application of a broad-spectrum biocide to disinfest soils prior to planting. Nonchemical methods are not suitable for a single tactic approach to pest management because they do not provide the same broad spectrum of activity or consistency as fumigation with methyl bromide. Nonchemical methods are compatible with an integrated pest management (IPM) approach, where multiple tactics are used to maintain damage from pests below an economic threshold while minimizing the impact to beneficial organisms. However, adoption of IPM is hindered by the paucity of economically feasible sampling programs and thresholds for soilborne pests and by a reluctance of growers to commit additional resources to the collection and management of biological information. A novel approach to the management of soilborne pests is to design the crop production system to avoid pest outbreaks. Using this "proactive" approach, a tomato production system was developed using strip-tillage into existing bahiagrass pasture. By minimizing inputs and disruption to the pasture, growers were able to reap the rotational benefits of bahiagrass without cultivating the rotational crop. While minimizing the need for interventive procedures, a proactive approach is difficult to integrate into existing crop production systems and will require several years of testing and validation.

AB Maize varieties with improved nitrogen(N)-use efficiency under low soil N conditions can contribute to sustainable agriculture. Tests were carried to see whether selection of European elite lines at low and high N supply would result in hybrids with differential adaptation to these contrasting N conditions. The objective was to analyze whether genotypic differences in N uptake and N-utilization efficiency existed in this material and to what extent these factors contributed to adaptation to low N supply. Twenty-four hybrids developed at low N supply (L x L) were compared with 25 hybrids developed at high N supply (H x H). The N uptake was determined as total above-ground N in whole plants, and N-utilization efficiency as the ratio between grain yield and N uptake in yield trials at four locations and at three N levels each. Highly significant variations as a result of hybrids and hybrids x N-level interaction were observed for grain yield as well as for N uptake and N-utilization efficiency in both hybrid types. Average yields of the L x L hybrids were higher than those of the H x H hybrids by 11.5% at low N supply and 5.4% at medium N level. There was no significant yield difference between the two hybrid types at high N supply. The L x L hybrids showed significantly higher N uptake at the low (12%) and medium (6%) N levels than the H x H hybrids. In contrast, no differences in N-utilization efficiency were observed between the hybrid types. These results indicate that adaptation of hybrids from European elite breeding material to conditions with reduced nitrogen input was possible and was mainly the result of an increase in N-uptake efficiency.

AB Two experiments were conducted during autumn 1997 and 1998 in west-central Florida to evaluate the effectiveness of soil solarization alone and in combination with the biological control agents Streptomyces lydicus (Actinovate) and Pseudomonas chlororaphis (syn. R aureofasciens, AtEze) and the reduced-risk fungicide fludioxonil (Medallion) in managing soilborne pathogens of impatiens (Impatiens x wallerana, 'Accent Burgundy'). Naturally infested soil was solarized for 47 or 48 days during September and October using two layers of 25-mum clear, low-density polyethylene mulch, separated by an air space of up to 7.5 cm. Solarization decreased the final incidence and progress of Rhizoctonia crown rot and blight, incidence of Pythium spp. in roots, and root discoloration, and increased shoot biomass in both experiments. The technique also consistently reduced root-knot severity and population densities of Meloidogyne incognita, Dolichodorus heterocephalus, Paratrichodorus minor, and Criconemella spp. The incidence of Rhizoctonia crown rot and blight was reduced by fludioxonil, but not by the biological control agents.

AB The tropical realm of the Pacific contains many islands with closely similar (analogous) environmental settings. Due to the 'filter effect' of the ocean, these are occupied by historically different species assemblages. This results in a unique biogeographic complexity not found in any of the continental tropical regions. The paper presents a hierarchical approach to the study of vegetation in analogous environments with data illustrated by a series of diagrams. It begins with differentiating island types and climatic zones. Then it focuses on Pacific-wide biomes, thereafter on island landscape profiles, and finally, on stand-level profiles as a method to compare forest structure and composition among islands in analogous environments at the scale of releves. The conclusions emphasize the urgent need for intensifying conservation-oriented research and capacity building in all island countries of the Pacific (not only Hawaii) to protect their indigenous biodiversities for sustainable uses and the health of their ecosystems. Attention is also drawn to the scientific advantage of using the Pacific-Asia Biodiversity Transect (PABITRA) Network, since it connects the island areas across biogeographic boundaries in form of an experimental design. This design refers to analogous island environments filled with different sets of biodiversities, which follow a trend of impoverishment with indigenous founder species from west to east.

AB The public policy literature has paid little attention to evaluating the ability of voluntary environmental programs to generate economic benefits for firms. Yet, given their voluntary nature, provision of economic benefits to firms is a necessary condition for these programs to become effective environmental policy instruments. Additionally, little is known about why firms operating in developing countries would participate in these initiatives.
   This paper provides some of the first cross-sectional empirical evidence about voluntary environmental programs established in developing countries. Specifically, the paper focuses on studying hotel participation in the Costa Rican Certification for Sustainable Tourism (CST program). The CST program is probably the first performance-based voluntary environmental program created by a developing country government. Results indicate that hotels with certified superior environmental performance show a positive relationship with differentiation advantages that yield rice premiums. Participation in the CST program alone is not significantly related to higher prices and higher sales. The evidence also indicates that participation in the CST program was significantly related to government monitoring, trade association membership and hotels focus on green consumers.

AB Flood defence measures do not provide a total solution to flood management but can significantly mitigate flood risks. They are often implemented as a combination of a whole range of measures, including flood forecasting and warning services. Historically, these services have often been provided as a last resort without identifying their relative contribution to overall flood protection. This paper offers one possible solution for integrating these services into the body of other flood management measures through quantifying the relative contribution of the individual measures. The need for the reallisation of the solution depends on stems from two major projects: (a) a research and development project on real-time modelling commissioned by the National Flood Warning Centre of the Environment Agency (the Agency); and (b) the project of Catchment Flood Management Plans (CFMPs) run by the Agency and the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA). The paper outlines the context of both projects and shows that flood forecasting and warning, as the management of flooding incidents, is integrated qualitatively to CFMPs. It also presents a tentative solution for integrating the relative contribution of individual flood management measures to mitigating flood risks.

AB PVC has been under intense and hostile attack for a number of years, primarily because of its association with chlorine chemistry. It has been argued by some that because of this association it is inherently unsustainable, although much of this argument has been emotionally driven rather than based upon scientific scrutiny. Yet the presence of chlorine imparts a range of unique technical features in PVC that set it apart from many other polymers. A number of these features are well known and documented, and perhaps this uniqueness makes it a fascinating polymer to study in terms of its potential for sustainability. It is durable in use and difficult to break down. This persistence has made it a target by some campaigners, yet this could arguably be one of its greatest strengths from a sustainability perspective. The following report assesses-on a scientific basis-what sustainability means to the PVC industry and the necessary steps that would be needed to deliver a truly sustainable polymer. The evaluation model presented is based on The Natural Step (TNS) framework. The TNS framework is a robust and science-based set of tools that define sustainability in unambiguous and workable terms and helps organisations engage with the practicalities of sustainable development. In particular, the study includes a case history of a sustainable development process leading up to this evaluation involving a number of leading UK retailers. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB The development of sustainable products requires not only the consideration of production processes. Rather, strategies and concepts for the end-of-life management of post-consumer products play an important role for their legal compliance, public acceptance and commercial competitiveness as well. With respect to the waste management options for polyvinyl chloride (PVC) products, the currently prevalent disposal in landfills was among the subjects of debate about environmental issues. A material and substance flow analysis was conducted to estimate the quantitative relevance of PVC products and their constituents in municipal solid waste. Landfill simulation assays demonstrated the long-term behaviour of PVC products and the fate of additives under landfill conditions. The methods of an integrated assessment and possible approaches towards life cycle management are discussed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB With more than 75% chemical enterprises already privatized or sold, the high-tonnage synthesis is the last sector at government's disposal. The 1995-2005 Chemical Synthesis Program has been failing. The Strategy for Poland's Chemical Industry until 2010, adopted June 2001, Is the most promising program now. Developing of Industrial production can follow the model of either (a) a (thermodynamically) closed industrial system that exchanges only energy with Nature or (b) soft technologies based on renewable raw materials that offer biodegradable products. Basic research and well-planned advancing studies are crucial. Perspective directions of applied studies here include synthesis of fine chemicals, catalysis, thermostable polymers, recycling, and protecion of environment Sustainable development and recycling are of paramount importance.

AB This article references the work of Daniel Goleman, author of Emotional Intelligence, Working with Emotional Intelligence, and co-author of Primal Leadership, creating an awareness of the contrast that exists between traditional training approaches and self-directed learning as we pursue leadership development. The emotional intelligence premise is overviewed and linked to the discussion of demonstrating a return on investment in our organizations as we deploy training programs to impact performance. The author contends that our traditional deployment of leadership development/communication skills training fails to, produce sustainable change in behaviors and supports Goleman's initiatives to invest in the emotional intelligence of leaders with individualized plans to impact the climate and performance of an organization.

AB Chemical crop protection, today a well-established technology to support sustainable production of food, feed, and fiber, will continue to play an important role in agribusiness in spite of the emergence of novel biotechnological solutions. Scientific progress in chemistry, biology, and molecular biology has revolutionized the way of searching for new agrochemicals over the past decade. Requirements, primarily in terms of safety to humans and the environment, have also changed. The search for and the development of novel agrochemicals with novel modes of action, improved safety profiles, and adapted to the changing requirement of the food and feed production chain are more than ever the challenge.

   Integrated coastal zone management
AB Some 44% of the world's population lives within 150 km of the coast and mass migration towards the coast will continue in the decades ahead. Degrading and exhaustive uses of land, water and other coastal resources and disruption of environmental processes through degradation of environmental quality and loss of critical terrestrial and aquatic habitats can lead to serious deleterious impacts on the health and productivity of coastal ecosystems. Following the Arusha Resolution (1993), the Seychelles Statement (1996) and the Colombo CZM Workshop (1999), the need for integrated coastal zone management has become critical because of the limited land resources and unproportional domination of coastal areas in the wider Caribbean and Indian Ocean/Pacific island states. The coastal zone of Mauritius (1,850 km(2), 20 degrees S, 58 degrees E, south-western Indian Ocean, 1.12 million inhabitants) was redefined in 1997 in the Environmental Protection Act of 1991 [Part VII (Act 34)] to include all islets within the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ; 1.7 million km 2). During the 1980s, the Mauritian economy underwent major structural changes successfully, with a rapid phase of industrialization diversifying into two major activities, textiles and tourism. Existing reports and data in a common framework have to be synthesized and organized to fill existing gaps in knowledge with data collection and scientific inquiries, to identify social and economic drivers and to relate socioeconomic change to demands for environmental resources (land use, water resources, marine systems) and environmental impacts as proposed under the MERMAID (Mauritius Environmental Resource Management and Industrial Development) project. Nutrient flux and sediment trace metal contamination studies are currently underway to investigate different watersheds impacted by agricultural, urban and industrial activities in the north-west of the island. There is a pressing need to integrate the natural sciences with socioeconomic disciplines as proposed by the International Human Dimensions Program (IHDP) for an integrated management of coastal zones. Three integrated pilot projects in the Pacific-Indian Ocean and wider Caribbean as identified by Land Ocean Interaction in the Coastal Zone (LOICZ) in the future, including current status and changes in material fluxes from drainage basins, transboundary impacts from the ocean and atmospheric inputs, could elucidate the land-sea interactions and human dimensions of change on small islands. The sustainability of marine resources and the conservation of biological diversity will depend on a critical understanding of linkages between human activities and ecological responses and upon a citizenry that assumes ownership of these regions. Case studies would also help in investigating how humans affect transport pathways and biogeochemical cycles in small island states.

AB The natural tropical rain forest is an irregular mosaic of ever-changing developmental phases of vegetation. Its structure is a key information for forest monitoring and sustainable management. This experimental study aims to improve the understanding of the relationships between the forest structure and the anisotropic behaviour of the remotely sensed forest reflectance. It relics on intensive field-based measurements and synchronous remote sensing data collection. Three different tropical rain forests have been observed using six different SPOT-HRVIR images. Texture information is related to forest structure by means of geostatistical analysis based on directional variograms for the NIR channel. The results demonstrate a strong interaction between the elements contributing to the forest structure, i.e. the tree crowns and the gaps, and the viewing and illumination conditions of each observation. The concept of the Bi-directional Standard deviation Distribution Function (BSDF) is introduced to discriminate the forest structures. A simple geometric-optical gap model explains more than 80% of the variability of the NIR reflectance standard deviation. Finally, a cross-thresholding approach using the NIR reflectance and the Local Directional Contrast (LDC) is proposed and successfully applied to discriminate the canopy roughness of the different forest sites.

AB This paper addresses the question of how technological transitions (TT) come about? Are there particular patterns and mechanisms in transition processes? TT are defined as major, long-term technological changes in the way societal functions are fulfilled. TT do not only involve changes in technology, but also changes in user practices, regulation, industrial networks, infrastructure, and symbolic meaning or culture. This paper practices 'appreciative theory' [R.R. Nelson, S.G. Winter, An Evolutionary Theory of Economic Change, Bellknap Press, Cambridge, MA, 1982] and brings together insights from evolutionary economics and technology studies. This results in a multi-level perspective on TT where two views of the evolution are combined: (i) evolution as a process of variation, selection and retention, (ii) evolution as a process of unfolding and reconfiguration. The perspective is empirically illustrated with a qualitative longitudinal case-study, the transition from sailing ships to steamships, 1780-1900. Three particular mechanisms in TT are described: niche-cumulation, technological add-on and hybridisation, riding along with market growth. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Major changes have been made over the past 20 years in the US intellectual property rights regime. These include the fact that the regime has been opened up to software patents and to business models, on one hand, and to living entities on the other-all within a general environment marked by the relaxation of patentability criteria. They have resulted in major changes in the US system of innovation-more specifically in the increasing privatisation of knowledge domains and activities that were previously public. The changes result from the combined effects of a response to US perceptions of increased foreign competition, of the emergence of major new technological opportunities in biotechnology and ICT, and of a series of regulatory changes that have paved the way for the financial sector's increased involvement, via direct investments in firms whose main activity is comprised of R&D. Contemporary doubts about the viability of these changes reflect, the harmful long-term economic effect of the privatisation of basic knowledge (especially in the biopharmaceutical sector) and the difficulties that the financial sector has faced in ensuring the sustainability of the necessary pre-conditions that allow for the development of innovation.

DE upside-down T-shaped afforestation way; microenvironment in root area of

AB Only by providing the good conditions for the growth of plants can a favorable ecological environment on which human beings rely for existence be created. The upside-down-T double-layer water-conserving afforestation way is developed according to the situation of the shortage of water resources, low soil fertility and vast land in the and areas. The characteristics of the afforestation way are to change the microenvironment in the root area of the plants, provide the favorable conditions for the growth of plants, and reduce the necessary conditions for the growth of plants in large areas in the arid regions. Meanwhile, the size of its water-conserving layer can be changed according to the size of the planted trees. The different ways of the bottom water-conserving layer can be used according to the requirements. The afforestation way is suitable for planting trees on a small scale and also for afforesting on a large scale under the adverse circumstances in the arid areas, and has been effectively used in the afforestation in the hinterland of Taklamakan Desert and the southern marginal zone of Gurbantonggut Desert. The prospects,of the afforestation way are broad in afforestation and desertification control in the desert regions.

DE Taklamakan Desert; Alhagi sparsifolia; water relation; sustainable
   management
AB Water relation characteristics of the desert legume Alhagi sparsifolia were investigated during the vegetation period from April to September 1999 in the foreland of Qira oasis at the southern fringe of the Taklamakan Desert, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region of China. The seasonal variation of predawn water potentials and of diurnal water potential indicated that Alhagi plants were well water supplied over the entire vegetation period. Decreasing values in the summer months were probably attributed to increasing temperatures and irradiation and therefore a higher evapotranspirative demand. Data from pressure-volume analysis confirmed that Alhagi plants were not drought stressed and xylem sap flow measurements indicated that Alhagi plants used large amounts of water during the summer months. Flood irrigation had no influence on water relations in Alhagi probably because Alhagi plants produced only few fine roots in the upper soil layers. The data indicate that Alhagi sparsifolia is. a drought-avoiding species that utilizes ground water by a deep roots system, which is the key characteristic to adjust the hyper-arid environment. Because growth and survival of Alhagi depends on ground water supply, it is important that variations of ground water depth are kept to a minimum. The study will provide a theoretical basis for the restoration and management of natural vegetation around oasis in and regions.

AB Environmental constraints have drastically limited options of sustainable development and have severely offset many developmental schemes. In this paper, possibilities of acidic deposition, as a counter measure of desertification, are analyzed. Seasonal data of ambient sulfur dioxide, pH of rain water and soil acidity are collected for over an year and analyzed. Arid environment of surrounding areas of Delhi is considered and analyzed. Though ambient sulfur deposition is well below critical level, it might not be truly indicative of plant survival in arid areas. Results may be useful in and area afforestation, and polluting industries relocation, which holds tremendous potential vis-a-vis sustainable development.

ID MOTHERS
AB Welfare to well-being leads to better quality of life for families and communities. Around the world, societies are experimenting and shifting policies that address welfare to well-being for families and communities. In the U. S., the greatest shift in several decades has occurred with the welfare reform policies. These shifts have placed at issue the extent to which individuals and families and governments contribute to self-sufficiency and sustainability of their members and the collective whole in society. The paper addresses: a framework for thinking about sustaining well-being in the context of making transitions from welfare for the few to well-being for the many; a research illustration of focus group findings on the meaning of self-sufficiency for families who are currently receiving one type of welfare (food stamps); and the opportunities emerging in the context of the interaction of the family and society at the community, state, national and global level that allows for a wholistic response to issues around well-being and quality of life studies.

SO SOCIAL POLICY & ADMINISTRATION
LA English
DT Article
DE food policy; public health; policy integration; policy confinement;
   sustainable food supply; multi-level governance
AB To address the policy malfunctions of the recent past and present, UK food policy needs to link policy areas that in the past have been dealt with in a disparate manner, and to draw on a new ecological public health approach. This will need a shift within the dominant trade liberalization-national economic competitiveness paradigm that currently informs UK food policy, and the international levels of the EU and the WTO trade rules, and grants the large corporate players in the food system a favoured place at the policy-making tables. The contradictions of the food system have wrought crises that have engendered widespread institutional change at all levels of governance. Recent institutional reforms to UK food policy, such as the FSA and DEFRA, reflect a bounded approach to policy integration. Initiatives seeking a more integrated approach to food policy problems, such as the Social Exclusion Unit's access to shops report, and the Policy Commission on the Future of Food and Farming, can end up confined to a particular policy sector framed by particular interests-a process of "policy confinement". However, the UK can learn from the experience of Norway and Finland who have found their own routes to a more joined up approach to public health and a sustainable food supply by for example, introducing a national food policy council. to provide integrated policy advice. Also, at the local and community levels in the UK, policy alternatives are being advanced in an ad hoc fashion by local food initiatives. More structural-level interventions at the regional and local governance levels are also needed to address the social dimensions of a sustainable food supply.

AB Surprise takes many forms, all tending to disrupt plans and planning systems. Reliance by decision makers on formal analytic methodologies can increase susceptibility to surprise as such methods commonly use available information to develop single-point forecasts or probability distributions Of future events. In doing so, traditional analyses divert attention from information potentially important to understanding and planning for effects of surprise. The authors propose employing computer-assisted reasoning methods in conjunction with simulation models to create large ensembles of plausible future scenarios. This framework supports a robust adaptive planning (RAP) approach to reasoning under the conditions of complexity and deep uncertainty that normally defeat analytic approaches. The authors demonstrate, using the example of planning for long-term global sustainability, how RAP methods may offer greater insight into the vulnerabilities inherent in several types of surprises and enhance decision makers' ability to construct strategies that will mitigate or minimize the effects of surprise.

AB The effects of cropping systems and management practices on soil properties provide essential information for assessing sustainability, and environmental impact. Tillage and fertilizer rates were evaluated for their effects on soil bulk density (BD), penetration resistance, soil organic carbon (SOC) concentration and availability of macronutrients on a sandy clay loam (fine-loamy, mixed, hyperthermic Typic Haplargids, USDA; Luvic Yermosoll, FAO) in a semi-arid region of Pakistan. Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) were double-cropped from 1996 to 1998. Tillage treatments were minimum till (MT), conventional till (CT), and deep till (DT). Low, medium and high fertilizer rates were applied to wheat and cotton. BD was affected neither by tillage nor fertilizer rates. Soil penetration resistance was lower for DT than CT and MT. Tillage methods affected soil P concentration but did not affect N and K concentrations. However, fertilizer application significantly increased soil P and K concentrations. Concentrations of N, P, K and SOC were greater in the plough layer than sub-soil. Grain yield of wheat was significantly negatively correlated with penetration resistance and was positively correlated with soil P and K concentrations. Yield of cotton was significantly negatively correlated with soil BD. These data provide an experimental basis to re-evaluate recommendations for fertilizer rates and tillage methods for production of wheat and cotton in Punjab. Further, there is a strong need to establish long-term experiments to study agronomic and environmental effects of tillage methods, fertilizer rates, and cropping systems on productivity and environment quality.

AB In grazed dairy pasture systems, a major source of NO3- leached and N2O emitted is the N returned in the urine from the grazing animal. The objective of this study was to use lysimeters to measure directly the effectiveness of a nitrification inhibitor, dicyandiamide (DCD), in decreasing NO3- leaching and N2O emissions from urine patches in a grazed dairy pasture under irrigation. The soil was a free-draining Lismore stony silt loam (Udic Haplustept loamy skeletal) and the pasture was a mixture of perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) and white clover (Trifolium repens). The use of DCD decreased NO3--N leaching by 76% for the urine N applied in the autumn, and by 42% for urine N applied in the spring, giving an annual average reduction of 59%. This would reduce the NO3--N leaching loss in a grazed paddock from 118 to 46 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1). The NO3--N concentration in the drainage water would be reduced accordingly from 19.7 to 7.7 mg N L-1, with the latter being below the drinking water guideline of 11.3 mg NL-1. Total N2O emissions following two urine applications were reduced from 46 kg N2O-N ha(-1) without DCD to 8.5 kg N2O-N with DCD, representing an 82% reduction. In addition to the environmental benefits, the use of DCD also increased herbage production by more than 30%, from 11 to 15 t ha(-1) yr(-1). The use of DCD therefore has the potential to make dairy farming more environmentally sustainable by reducing NO3- leaching and N2O emissions.

AB Solid state ionic technologies such as fuel cells, sensors, batteries, supercapacitors, hydrogen generation, storage de ices and electrochromic,windows are likely to play a major role in extending the life of existing fossil fuel resources by increasing the overall efficiency of energy generation and use. This ill lead to a reduction in the emissions of greenhouse gases and Pollutants. No single technology in isolation is likely to provide Solutions for the energy and environmental needs of future generations. This paper briefly outlines the applications of solid state ionic technologies for sustainable energy generation and summarises key Australian initiatives in this field. It also emphasises the significance of a total systems approach and discusses integration of renewable and solid state ionic technologies for clean and sustainable energy generation.

   systems; coevolution; technology assessment
AB Science-based innovations have played an important role in our society for centuries. In this paper, after a discussion of the concept of innovation, changes in three major developments in the context of innovation processes are analysed: structural changes in our economy, the broadening of decision-making processes and the emergence of the network society, and changes in the knowledge infrastructure. On the basis of this analysis, questions and challenges confronting the players involved in innovation processes and the management of them are identified and topics for a research agenda for innovation researchers that take into account the needs of these players are formulated. The focus is on the macro and meso level, and the broadening of decision-making on innovation processes acts as an important guiding principle. Three lines of research are distinguished on the research agenda: (1) empirical studies of innovation processes and systems, (2) critical reflection on innovation theory, and (3) analysis and support of decision-making processes. With regard to the first line, case studies of innovation in services, life sciences, the relationship between ICT and sustainability and the identification of (intangible) throughput and output indicators are on the agenda. The reflection on theory (line 2) focuses primarily on innovation in chains and clusters, the role of (knowledge intensive) intermediaries and the interaction between processes and systems. Furthermore, innovation studies should also try to contribute towards endogenisation of innovation in other scientific disciplines. With regard to the analysis and support of decision-making processes (line 3), strategic intelligence providing insight into the potential, application and implementation of new technologies and the development of instruments to support players in innovation processes are addressed. An important basic assumption of this paper is that innovation studies should not only strive to deepen the insight into innovation processes and systems, but also to contribute to the development of insights, concepts, methods, techniques and instruments to support various players involved in innovation processes. The major conclusion of this paper is that shifts in the context of innovation processes, more particularly the emergence of the 'porous society', will lead to a radical transformation of innovation systems in which (knowledge intensive) intermediaries and the quality of the interface between users and producers play an increasingly important role.

AB The sustainability criteria espoused by sustainable development (SD) models can be broadly classified along a weak-strong axis according to the quantity/entity they would opt to preserve (e.g. total capital stock, natural capital stock, individual forms of natural capital, etc.) and their belief in substitutability across various forms of capital. Underpinning this focus differentiation is a differing degree of belief in the ability of technical progress to allow substitution across different forms of natural and man-made capital. This paper presents a distilled version of the salient topics in thinking on SD and suggests a synthetic/eclectic approach emerging from and drawing on all shades of the weak-strong spectrum. A key for substitutability is technical progress. The latter can be seen as a form of human capital in which society invests. Technical progress not only enhances substitutability across forms of capital but also promotes economic growth, which, in turn, allows high investment in human capital, formation. The picture becomes less rosy when we are near catastrophe thresholds or, perforce, when there is uncertainty about what such thresholds are. A. useful rule-of-thumb seems to be to keep the option set as in-tact as possible for as long as possible while science improves our understanding of what is at stake. (C) 2602 Elsevier Science Inc.

DT Article
AB As we witness a changing landscape of business and world affairs, it becomes increasingly more important to maintain a systemic understanding of developments, as a guide for improved strategic management. Organizations that embarked on implementing new approaches (TQM, reengineering, learning organizations, etc) for significant performance improvements have experienced limited or no success. In periods of rapid change, the paramount challenges in strategic management are related to the effective execution of current plans and the adaptation needed to cope with change. Two significant causes for disappointing results have been the lack of framing problems in systemic terms and the poor coordination resulting from inefficient communication patterns. In this sense, any solution to a problem contains the seeds of the next set of problems. An effective approach for handling these deficiencies highlights the conversations-for-action needed for effective coordination in both strategic and operational planning. The need to develop and implement viable strategies for sustainable high performance requires that, in addition to materials and information flows within a system, we must explore ways to accommodate this third kind of flow of human communications within and between organizations.

ID MANAGEMENT
AB The concept of sustainable development has been touted as a new planning agenda (Beatley & Manning, 1998). As such, it becomes a fundamental concept that should be an important aspect of all further policy developments (Loffler, 1998). Sustainable development is based on a perceived need to address environmental deterioration and to maintain the vital functions of natural systems for the well being of present and future generations. Sustainability is defined as 'the ability of an organization to adapt to change in the business environment to capture contemporary best practice methods and to achieve and maintain superior competitive performance' (Zairi & Liburd 2001). This concept implies that sustainability is a mean for an organization to maintain its competitiveness. Quinn (2000) has a similar idea on sustainability. He describes it as the development that meets present needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. Gladwin et al. (1995), on the other hand, define it as 'development, which meets the needs of the present, without compromising the ability of future organisations to meet their own needs Total Quality Management (TQM) represents an integrative approach for the pursuit of customer satisfaction (Chin et al., 2001). However, facing intense pressure of global competition, organizations need to consider incorporating the idea of sustainability in TQM in order to sustain their competitive advantage and performance improvement. In addition, the interest of organizational survival, growth and prosperity has therefore got to be concerned with not just the present but also the future. ne concept of sustainability does however remain unclear and it is therefore worth exploring further how it can be applied. It is the purpose of this paper to highlight some of the key issues of sustainable TQM, to trace transformational evolutions that bring different orientations over time. The paper will then describe how various critical factors can create a sustainable competitive advantage, when working in harmony. Finally, a wide range of best practices will be illustrated to support a proposed model for TQM sustainability.

TI Effect of community-wide use of insecticide-treated nets for 3-4 years
   on malarial morbidity in Tanzania

ID BEDNETS
AB Objectives To investigate (1) benefits due to personal protection of individual net users vs. mass killing of mosquitoes within villages as a result of widespread net usage; (2) sustainability over several years of benefits against malarial morbidity of insecticide-treated nets; ( 3) distribution of the benefits in different age groups of children and (4) whether, as a result of fading immunity, older age groups 'paid for' the benefits which they had enjoyed when younger.
   Methods (1) Tabulation of earlier data to compare personal and community-wide effects against mosquito vectors; (2) two cross-sectional surveys for malaria parasitaemia, malarial fever, anaemia and splenomegaly in children in eight Tanzanian villages, in which there had been community-wide use of bednets which had been annually re-treated with alphacypermethrin for 3-4 years; ( 3) comparison between children of different age groups and with intact, torn or no nets in these villages and in 4-6 villages without nets.
   Results A 90-95% reduction in infective bites outside nets in netted villages and an additional 54-82% reduction of bites among individual net users. Highly significant reductions ( by 55-75%) in malarial morbidity for children aged 6 months to 2 years were found in netted villages with, for some outcomes, better results among individuals who themselves had intact treated nets. For older children, benefits were less clear or absent, but there was no sign that the benefits early in life were 'paid for' by worse outcomes in the netted villages later in childhood.
   Conclusions The overall benefits to the community of widespread use of treated nets are sustainable and are not reversed in 3-4 years as a result of fading immunity. It is important to ensure high enough coverage to realize the full potential of the treated net method. By showing an impact on the vector population in the community these results provide a strong argument for organized free provision of net treatment, rather than relying on marketing.

ID SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA; DISEASE
AB The malaria eradication campaign of the 1950s and 1960s achieved elimination of malaria from the industrialized world and drastic reduction of malaria elsewhere, especially Asia. In Africa, eradication was hardly attempted. For various reasons, results could not be maintained. Eradication had to be given up, control became the policy. Since 1992 malaria control is based on four principles: early diagnosis and treatment; selective and sustainable preventive measures, including vector control; detection, containment and prevention of epidemics, and building up of local capacity. Several constraints with the presently available tools are discussed. Major problems are drug resistance and poor performance of the health sector. International awareness of the problem and international co-operation, the financial resources now available and scientific advances offer opportunities for a concerted effort to reduce the burden of malaria. Operational research, field research and implementation and improvement of the peripheral health service will be of paramount importance.

TI Who built Irvine? Private planning and the federal government
SO URBAN STUDIES

DT Article
ID URBAN-POLICY; US
AB The Irvine Ranch in Southern California is the largest privately master-planned 'new community' or satellite new town ever to be built in the US. The development was led by the private sector but government played an important role. This paper traces how the federal government shaped the Irvine development through a range of policies and programmes from defence to habitat protection. In turn, the developers of Irvine were cast in a role of co-ordinating parts of government. This analysis highlights some of the problems likely to be faced as governments promote similarly phased, co-ordinated and mixed-use proposals under the rubric of smart growth or sustainable development.

Assessment of existing water supply and demand is presented and strategies are outlined. Potential available water resources and uses are presented. Strategies to meet unsatisfied water demand are presented. These include use of nonconventional water resources, privatization, efficiency enhancement in distribution systems, and demand management. Scenarios for sustainable water management are developed. Each scenario was based on combinations of the role of government in the water sector and the national financial situation. Comparisons among these scenarios were performed for the case of Jordan and a set Of recommendations are stated.

   problematique
ID WATER
AB Globally and regionally a realization is setting in that the constraint of freshwater resources availability and their sharing could be a major impediment to security and subsequently to sustainable development of developing countries. This aspect of sustainability referred to as the "Problematique" requires a long-term perspective and explicit recognition of a plethora of dimensions of development that need to be considered independently and simultaneously. In this paper, we discuss the Nile River Problematique as a hypothetical situation, using a methodology to study the policy formulation between the years 2000 and 2050 for development of Egypt and the upstream country of Ethiopia as constrained by, the growing population, increased global pressure for economic development, and the shared, annually finite water resource - the Nile. First, policy objectives are formulated. Central to our approach is the use of a decision (goal) seeking paradigm for the human dimension of global change referred to as the cybernetic paradigm. This requires the use of multilevel architecture Of models to deal with complexity and the human/machine interactive process to deal with uncertainty. A computer-based reasoning support system is used. Different policy targets are examined. The approach yields not only which combination of policy options will work, but the level and extent the policies must be applied. How such policy measures are to be enforced is not discussed. Policy implications are presented quantitatively using a "foresight" or scenario approach. The formulated policies here are not prescriptive; however practitioners have tested the methodology in a workshop.

TI Application of decision support system for sustainable management of
   water resources in the Azraq Basin - Jordan
SO WATER INTERNATIONAL
LA English
DT Article
AB Water scarcity in Jordan is a significant constraint to development, with limited available water and financial resources. As population and economic activity increase, it will be necessary to implement national strategies that seek to balance the present needs and those of future generations. Multiple variables associated with agricultural crops, industries, and the impact of climate change, were incorporated into a Decision Support System (DSS). The DSS utilized Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), which resulted in the prioritization of sustainable water policies for management in the Azraq Basin. The inputs to the DSS were generated through application of Modflow (groundwater), stochastic, and Penman Montieth models and through calculations of water productivity for agricultural and industrial sectors. The results of the DSS make recommendations as to how to enhance, long-term sustainability of water resources in Azraq, while allowing for water utilization and economic growth. It is recommended for future planning that further research of the impacts to water resources must be conducted at local and national levels and linked to regional and global climate change prediction. It can be concluded that the DSS tool and AHP are potentially positive contributions to the process of decision-making for selection and ranking of alternatives and policies and for help in solving problems that include conflicting criteria.

AB Three case studies of recent institutional capacity building projects within the water sectors of Mozambique and Zimbabwe are presented. These projects are classified and discussed using the analysis tools presented in Part 1 of this paper It is concluded that the successful outcome of ICB projects to a large degree depends on the design of the project as well as the willingness of the beneficiary and funding agencies to adopt a flexible and process-oriented approach. The importance of addressing human talent, organization, and resources as well as institutional development aspects in order to achieve sustainable results in ICB interventions is also illustrated.

ID WINTER; RATES
AB Northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) populations have been declining significantly throughout much of their North American range. Food plots are a management tool that might alleviate the bobwhite's winter stress, improving population sustainability, but their positive effect could be negated by increased hunter harvests near food plots. Food plots have been used to increase available winter food sources for northern bobwhites oil the Fort Riley Military Reservation since the early 1960s, We hypothesized that food plots increased hunting mortality of bobwhites by concentrating hunters and bobwhites around food plots. We monitored 554 radiomarked bobwhites during the 1994-1995, 1995-1996, and 1996-1997 winters to estimate Survival and cause-specific mortality near and far from food plots. Effect of hunting mortality near food plot.,, was weak and inconsistent. Feeding in food plots by nontarget wildlife compromised the comparison of overwinter survival of bobwhites near and far from food plots during A years and study sites. Avian and mammalian predators accounted for 55% of overwinter mortality of radiomarked bobwhites during the study. We provide recommendations to reduce mortality and increase survival of bobwhites on Fort Riley during winter. These strategies might apply to other bobwhite populations in North America.

AB Landscapes and landscape structures that enable the exchange, dispersal and migration of big forest-favouring game species are resources which densly populated Europe is running short of. Two projects in Austria provide information that is needed for the management of this ressource. "Efficient green bridge insertion in Austria" is a project which lead to a concept of green bridges for the Austrian network of motorways. By evaluating existing passageways wider than 30 m and their suitability for wildlife and further by gathering information about the most important migration routes for red deer, moose and large carnivores the permeability of the network of motorways was investigated. An interdisciplinary project in Austria, titled "Wildlife corridors", examined the applicability of remote sensing methods and terrestrial surveys to identify corridor structures at different landscape scales. With the collected data and information from aerial/satellite images and terrestrial surveys a resistance model for the investigation area and the indicator species red deer and wild boar could be developed. The most probable migration route between the floodplains of the Danube and the floodplains of the Leitha was detected. Both projects reveal explicit measurements of "resource management", which ensure genetic exchange on the long term. They are a contribution to sustainable wildlife management in Austria and the border areas. Besides the improvement and implementation of the gained data, the integration of our results in instruments of regional planning and landsape planning are the most important next steps. Only thereby the ressource wildlife corridor can be taken into consideration in planning processes and strategies at different scales.

DE Cyprus; hunting; fallow deer; Dama mesopotamica; prehistory; subsistence
AB Recent archaeological discoveries have shown that it was over 10,000 years ago that people of the Pre-pottery Neolithic B culture of mainland southwestern Asia colonized the island of Cyprus. In order to sustain their agro-pastoral way of life they imported a range of exotic plants and animals. Amongst the animals, sheep, goat, pig and cattle were arguably domestic, whilst the Persian fallow deer (Dama mesopotamica) would most likely have been released to be exploited as a free-living game animal. Whilst it constituted only a minor resource in mainland subsistence economies during the Holocene, the fallow deer rapidly rose to a conspicuous level of importance in early prehistoric (Neolithic and Chalcolithic) Cyprus, declining only during the Bronze Age, after about 4,000 years ago. That deer hunting persisted as an economic activity of the first importance throughout at least six millennia suggests that prehistoric communities on the island of Cyprus must successfully have pursued a system of game management which focused not only on productivity but also upon sustainability.

AB The concept of sustainability was introduced into the forestry literature by H. C. VON CARLOWITZ in 1713 and into the hunting literature in 1812 by G. L. HARTIG. In the field of hunting, some qualitative aspects were added by F. VON RAESFELD from 1899 onward. Today the concept of sustainability is firmly established in wildlife management. In this sense hunting is defined as sustainable management of game populations. By that, the concept and the principle of sustainability have become part of hunting philosophy and general reasoning in the field of naturphilosophie.

ID SELF-DETERMINATION; AFRICA; MANAGEMENT; ZIMBABWE
AB In light of the increasing loss of species diversity and human cultural diversity and the pressure top-down nature conservation has often placed on local cultures around the world, understanding the linkages between conservation and cultural sustainability and finding ways to address them in an integrated way have become critically important. The potential for linking conservation and cultural sustainability is examined through the case of the Paphos Forest in Cyprus. In the Paphos Forest, the Cyprus mouflon (Ovis gmelini ophion), an endangered subspecies of wild sheep, faces an uncertain future, while small village communities are experiencing decline and are struggling to sustain their way of life. This paper describes the historical context that has guided conservation policy in Cyprus and presents the findings of a preliminary qualitative inquiry conducted in the summer of 2000 in four village communities in the Paphos Forest. The inquiry revealed that local people are greatly concerned about the future of their villages and find intolerable the agricultural damages caused by mouflon, which place an additional strain on local agriculture. Despite these problems, there is potential for linking conservation with efforts to enhance the viability of the village communities. Local people value the forest and generally support the conservation of the Cyprus mouflon, which is considered an element of the local culture. Furthermore, people would welcome opportunities to participate in conservation programs, with the hope that this would benefit both mouflon and their communities.

AB In Europe, the majority of driven pheasant shooting is supported by the release of captive-reared pheasants to increase numbers of birds available to hunters. In Austria, as in the rest of Europe, intensification of agriculture has contributed to the decline of wild pheasant populations during the last 40 years. However, high densities of wild pheasants can still be found in some areas. Seefeld Estate, a 2400ha farm in Lower Austria, has among the highest densities of wild pheasants in Europe. Spring densities of over 100 hens/km(2) have been measured on areas of this efficient and productive modern arable fanning estate. Imaginative management of set-aside, game cover and field margins, combined with targeted predation control, have enabled an annual sustainable harvest of wild pheasants to be maintained. The annual harvest in the last 10 years has ranged from 16 to 54 birds/km(2). Seefeld has maintained these higher densities in a region where wild pheasants have otherwise declined (current mean annual harvest = 4 birds/km(2)). This paper discusses the main factors responsible for high pheasant densities at Seefeld Estate and their implications for wild pheasant management in Europe. In addition, we will discuss the added conservation benefits accrued on Seefeld Estate because of wild pheasant management.

AB We present generalized regression analysis and spatial prediction (GRASP) conceptually as a method for producing spatial predictions using statistical models, and introduce and demonstrate a specific implementation in Spins that facilitates the process. We put forward GRASP as a new name encapsulating an existing concept that aims at making spatial predictions using generalized regression analysis. Regression modeling is used to establish relationships between a response variable and a set of spatial predictors. The regression relationships are then used to make spatial predictions of the response. The GRASP process requires point measurements of the response, as well as regional coverages of predictor variables that are statistically (and preferably causally) important in determining the patterns of the response. This approach to spatial prediction is becoming more commonplace, and it is useful to define it as a general concept. For instance, GRASP could use a survey of the abundance of a species (the response), and existing spatial coverages of environmental (e.g. climate, landform) variables (the predictors) for a region. A multiple regression can be used to establish the statistical relationship between the species abundance and the environmental variables. These regression relationships can then be used to predict the species abundance from the environmental surfaces. This process defines relationships in environmental space and uses these relationships to predict in geographic space. We introduce GRASP (the implementation) as an interface and collection of functions in Splus designed to facilitate modern regression analysis and the use of these regressions for making spatial predictions. GRASP standardizes the modeling process and makes it more reproducible and less subjective, while preserving analysis flexibility. The set of functions provides a toolbox that allows quick and easy data checking, model building and evaluation, and calculation of predictions. The current version uses generalized additive models (GAMs), a modern non-parametric regression technique the advantages of which are discussed. We demonstrate the use of the GRASP implementation to model and predict the natural distributions of two components of New Zealand fern biodiversity: (1) the natural distribution of an icon secies, silver fern (Cyathea dealbata); and (2) the natural pattern of total fern species richness. Key steps are demonstrated, including data preparation, options setting, data exploration, model building, model validation and interpretation, and spatial prediction. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Seahorse aquaculture has received widespread attention due to concerns over declines in wild seahorse populations, and in recognition of their high economic value and marketability. Seahorse aquaculture has great potential to integrate both conservation and sustainable development goals by providing an alternative livelihood option for fishers in source countries who, in the absence of alternatives to fishing, continue to exploit declining seahorse populations. To date, few culturing protocols have been established for tropical species exploited in Indo-Pacific source countries. We here present data on culturing Hippocampus kuda, one of the more heavily exploited species in both traditional medicines and marine aquarium trades. We also present results of an experiment testing the effects of three locally available Artemia enrichments on H. kuda survivorship, sex ratios, and growth to market size (14 weeks of age). Our results indicate that H. kuda grows rapidly from birth to 14 weeks, at a rate of 0.9-1.53 mm day(-1). Survivorship to market size varied among Artemia enrichments and was highest (73%) when seahorses were fed Artemia enriched with an emulsion derived from Acetes sp., a locally available planktonic crustacean, and lowest (40%) when seahorses were fed Artemia enriched with an emulsion derived from local fish. Growth, however, did not vary among enrichments. Sex ratios were not significantly different from the expected ratio of 1:1 nor did enrichment affect sex ratio. The seahorses were only marginally sexually dimorphic at market size (males 3 mm > females in standard length). The rapid growth rate and high survival of H. kuda on readily available local Artemia enrichments is promising for the development of seahorse aquaculture in source countries.

ID MATRIX MODEL
AB An approach is developed for analysis of harvest and effort data that uses a surplus production model modified for analyses in a fluctuating environment, and that maximizes harvest with as small an effect on the intrinsic rate of increase as possible. Harvest and hunter effort data that are suitable for analysis with a surplus production model have been collected for several wildlife species for many years. I used data for the mallard duck, lesser scaup duck, white-tailed deer, and black bear. The parameters were estimated with harvest and hunter data using non-linear least squares. For each species both the relation between the maximum sustainable harvest (MSH) and effort and a more conservative optimal level of harvest and effort were obtained under a range of environmental conditions. The mallard duck and white-tailed deer were both over harvested for short periods in the past, but only the black bear population appears over harvested today.

AB Life-history models have traditionally dealt with short-term evolution where evolutionary equilibria arise from genotypic and phenotypic covariance that have evolved by natural selection. For the case of body mass evolution in mobile organisms with non-overlapping generations, I analyse an alternative model of long-term evolution by the ecological constraint of density dependence in the number of intraspecific competitive interactions per individual. The model is based on the principle that phenotypic constraints that may explain the evolution of life-histories shall not be assumed unless the constraints reflect laws that lie outside the domain of evolutionary biology. It is argued that the model may explain population dynamic cycles either by selection acting directly on genotypic variation or by long-term selection for inheritable phenotypic responses that react to the density dependent changes in the ecology. The model has an evolutionary equilibrium that is a continuously stable strategy (CSS) when, at equilibrium abundance, the second derivative of the density regulation function with respect to the intra-population variation in In body mass is smaller than the density regulation function or the first derivative of that function. On the time-scale of population dynamics the model shows inertial dynamics with damped, stable, or repelling cycles in population abundance and life-history traits like the body mass and the intrinsic population dynamic growth rate. For harvested populations that are allowed sufficient time to equilibrate at the CSS, the equilibrium abundance is constant and independent of the harvest while the intrinsic growth rate is positively related to the harvest. This implies no upper limit to the long-term sustainable harvest of individuals, although there is an upper limit to the sustainable harvest of biomass. It is also shown that the evolutionary maximal harvest does not generally coincide with the maximal sustainable yield. And that harvest functions that increase more than proportional with the abundance will stabilise the cyclic population dynamics, while harvest functions that increase less than proportional will destabilise the dynamics.

ID CROSS-FLOW MICROFILTRATION; DEPOSITION
AB The development of fouling in a cross-flow microfilter coupled to an anaerobic bioreactor has been studied. The membrane bioreactor (MBR) was operated at a fixed flux substantially lower than the nominal 'critical flux' of the feed, measured by flux-stepping. A characteristic two-stage transmembrane pressure (TMP) profile was observed with an initially extended period of slow TMP rise followed by a sudden transition to a rapid TMP rise. This TMP profile was reproducible and depended on the imposed flux. The generic nature of this behaviour was confirmed in the MBR literature. Membrane autopsy revealed significant fouling by extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and an uneven distribution of EPS and fouling resistance. The initial and gradual TMP rise is believed to be caused by the deposition of this EPS. The sudden rise in TMP is believed to be caused by local flux in some regions of the membrane increasing (to maintain the fixed average flux) and exceeding the critical flux of the dominant foulant (biomass). Strategies to extend the sustainable operating period are discussed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Sustainability in agricultural landscapes means that the use and management of ecological potential does not reduce its capacity to meet society's future environmental, social and economic needs. Using this description of sustainability, Australian agricultural systems are far from sustainable at present. Removal of vast areas of native vegetation and the introduction of inappropriate agricultural systems have resulted in extensive loss of native biota, loss of productive agricultural land and decline in rural society. These degrading trends will continue to worsen unless Australian society intervenes on a broad scale. For example, to stop water tables from rising with attendant salination of soil, it has been estimated that over 30 billion perennial trees and shrubs will need to be planted. How does a society generate the will and ability to tackle environmental problems at this scale when its community and institutional boundaries do not reflect ecological reality? This paper discusses these issues and concludes with a 10-point plan to guide development of an approach to sustainable landscapes. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, we investigate the durability of environmental knowledge. We draw upon two case studies on different types of environmental knowledge. One is theoretical: the concept of "natural capital" as an organising element in ecological economics. The other one is practical: knowledge used in the choice of technique in district heating. Our claim is that the validity of knowledge is the result of a process in which knowledge claims are incorporated as natural elements into broader discursive and political contexts. Techniques of creating temporal continuums and ruptures are essential in that process. Thus, the way how knowledge claims relate to people and their goals defines the temporal durability of knowledge, not their intrinsic properties. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

ID MANAGEMENT; ISSUES
AB As manufacturing firms search relentlessly for sources of competitive advantage, a greater emphasis is developing on supply chain management as a means of achieving differentiation in a firm's strategic position. Currently, some researchers are focusing on effective 'end to end' management of key logistical process linkages within the supply chain, as a means of achieving sustainable competitive advantage that is difficult for competitors to emulate. The emphasis presented is on improved delivery performance and customer service. This involves defining optimized balances between supply chain parameters, the achievement of which should result in reduced cost, improved use of working capital, better asset utilization and optimized intra-supply-chain usage. This paper discusses the development of a model and illustrates an application in a major multinational steel producer. Progress has been made in understanding the logistical processes that are used to manage supply chain linkages and, importantly, in understanding the feed-forward and feedback linkages that are necessary to enable supply chain management to be more effective. A generic model for a tiered approach to the planning and scheduling of manufacturing supply chains is thus presented. Ideas for further work are described.

AB Technological change has affected most aspects of farm enterprises in Nigeria in the past few decades with many positive and negative consequences on the entrepreneurs. The study investigated the extent of this change and the effect on rural farm enterprises in southeastern Nigeria. It also attempted assessing the technical changes in relation to the perceived negative consequences to find out if the changes were neutral and/or biased to those consequences. Data were collected from 200 farm entrepreneurs from four out of nine states of southeastern Nigeria by the use of interview schedules. Descriptive statistics and factor analysis were used as the analytical tools. The major finding was that technological change was neutral to most of the perceived negative consequences associated with change. Most of the problems were institutional and farm entrepreneur related. The study recommends that all the identified agencies, institutional and social problems relating to technological adoption and use in farms in the area must be tackled if the needed transformation of agriculture is to be achieved in the new century.

AB Tropical agricultural systems characterized by swidden-fallow practices have been studied in many tropical areas of the world. One feature of these systems is the high diversity of cultivated species and varieties. The objective of this paper was to analyze the inter and intraspecific diversity of cultivated crops under swidden cultivation systems adopted by caicaras in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, and the genetic erosion of this diversity in the last decades. To analyze the inter and intraspecific diversity of cultivated crops under swidden cultivation systems in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, interviews were performed in 33 swidden agriculturists' households concerning the species and varieties under cultivation and others that have been lost. The plots were visited to check the crops cited in the interviews. The agriculturists cited 261 varieties from 53 crop species, with 30.6% of lost varieties. Each agriculturist cited an average of 25 varieties. The main crop was cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz), followed by yams (Dioscorea spp.), sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas Poir.), squash (Cucurbita pepo L.), sugarcane' (Saccharum officinarum L.), and beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.). Among the interviewed agriculturists, 87% of them have sons and/or daughters not involved in agricultural activity, reflecting a trend toward the loss of the local agricultural skills. A model was proposed to explain the dynamics of the system focusing on the crop diversity and considering the resource resilience. The exchange of crop varieties among agriculturists builds a network which buffers against the loss of the managed diversity in the regional scale. Features such as the itinerancy cycles of fallow/swidden, and the traditional ecological knowledge contribute to the increasing of the managed diversity. However, the agriculturists also pointed out several factors contributing to the depletion of the managed diversity, related to restrictive environmental laws, rural exodus, increasing tourism, and changing of livelihood activities. The loss of crop diversity indicates the urgency for strategies towards the maintenance of the diversity and knowledge tied to the agricultural systems of caicara communities, calling for specific strategies and policies to avoid the loss of their agricultural legacy.

AB In humid tropical agroecosysterns, maintenance of soil fertility is critical to sustainability, yet inputs of fossil-fuel fertilizer are beyond the economic means of many farmers. One economically viable alternative is to manage soil organic matter (SOM) dynamics by altering the composition and number of crop species. The objectives of this study were to determine long-term effects of crop-species composition and richness on indices of soil fertility, in comparison with forests, and to evaluate mechanisms of crop-species influence. Study plots were established in the diverse array of agroecosystems in Kerala, India, where agriculture has been documented for >4000 year. With 91 different crops in the region, analyses were simplified by categorizing crops by functional groups, based on life form, nutrient cycling traits, and phenology. Mono-, bi- and polycultures contained 1, 2 and >2 functional groups, respectively. A paired-plot design in which a monoculture or biculture was paired with a polyculture within a farm was used, such that climate, soil, ownership, and management were as similar as possible for a pair. Soil properties (total soil organic carbon (SOC), N, pH, bulk density) and crop structural attributes that had the potential to influence SOC stocks (basal area and frequency) were measured in 100 m(2) plots (n = 70 pairs) within 50 farms. Three plots in nearby forests provided a basis for comparison. Total SOC ranged from 6 to 20 g kg(-1) (in coastal areas and uplands, respectively), compared to 34-60 g kg(-1) in nearby upland forests. Differences in total SOC between mono- and polycultures depended on identity of the functional group in the monoculture: SOC amounts were higher in polycultures if the monoculture in comparison was a palm (P = 0.02) or herbaceous annual (P = 0.001), but not if the monoculture was a deciduous tree. Total SOC was 61% lower in polycultures cultivated for 40-60 years than in nearby forests. Under some conditions, total SOC increased directly with basal area (BA), an index of shading, indicating that BA may be an important design element of agroecosystems. Modeling results indicated that differences in lignin content of crop inputs could influence SOM quantity and quality; hence, crop tissue-chemistry traits may also be important elements of design. These results from ancient, humid tropical agroecosystems suggest that for maintenance of long-term soil fertility, high species richness may not be as important as individual species traits that influence nutrient cycling.

AB Chinese ecological agriculture (CEA) is a relatively recent agricultural and rural development approach, which has emerged in light of continuous efforts in exploring sustainable agriculture and rural development in modem China. Based on the discussion of the ecological agricultural concepts and practices in ancient China, as well as the agro-ecological problems that have emerged in modem China, this paper introduces the emergence and development process of CEA and analyses its concept, connotation and underlying principles. In addition, the processes as well as some practical principles in organizing CEA projects are discussed, and the major CEA development patterns currently practiced in China are introduced. Using the Fushan Integrated Ecological Farm in Fushan village, Zhejiang Province, a typical CEA project in south China, as an example, the practical organization process of a CEA project is introduced as well as the significant benefits achieved by the launching of an appropriate CEA project in China's rural areas. The successful practices of a variety of CEA projects with various development patterns and models that have been developed with adaptation to various natural and socioeconomic conditions across China justify the rationality as well as applicability of the CEA approach, showing its important relevance to agricultural and rural development in China.

   approach to multiple land-use in an isolated location

   indigenous knowledge; sustainability
AB This paper presents an example of how agroforestry is practised to satisfy the local people's basic subsistence needs in the isolated Indian Ocean island of Soqotra, Republic of Yemen, south of the Arabian Peninsula. Combined with an arid tropical climate, the harsh seasonal conditions and annual period of isolation have moulded the culture of the Soqotra population, and fostered a traditional approach to land-use, based on the seasonal cultivation of homegardens and ranging of livestock ( mostly goats). The homegardens contain many species of cultivated plants, composed of a wide diversity of plant groups. In addition to food, some cultivated plants provide medicine ( mostly endemic plants such as Aloe perryi, Jatropha unicostata, Commiphora ornifolia), forage for domestic goats, cattle and camels (e.g., Paracalyx sp., Thespesia populnea, Pennisetum purpureum), shade and other aesthetic values ( e. g., Cordia sinensis, Parkinsonia aculeata, Pithecolobium dulce). Most gardens are located around the periphery of towns and villages, with aspects of location, climate, and other ecological parameters carefully considered in their establishment. Homegardens are mostly worked by women, and to a lesser extent by children and men. At present, only a small proportion of Soqotra's population cultivates homegardens. Historically, and up to the present day, there has been little commercial utilisation of the cultivated species. Considerable potential exists for the development and/or expansion of local markets, although the recent increase in supply of produce from the mainland via commercial air delivery may limit such expansion.

AB Which decision support tools should be developed to help agricultural stakeholders manage nitrogen in an environmentally friendly way? This paper presents the limitations of current decision support tools with respect to the implementation of a four-step quality spiral. PLAN: planning technical actions that satisfy both economic and environmental constraints. The priorities are to develop decision tools at the farm and the regional levels, and to estimate the indirect effects of nitrogen on the environment due to its interaction with pesticides. DO: implementation of technical actions. The design of decision support tools must integrate more information about the way in which farmers and their advisors will use the tools. CHECK: efficiency of the "PLAN/DO" steps must be evaluated on different scales. The priority is to propose and validate environmental indicators. ACT: definition of new priorities for the next loop. Research is required on diagnosis tools for tracing back the causes of environmental problems.

AB The validation of the carbon and nitrogen model NDICEA ( Nitrogen Dynamics in Crop rotations in Ecological Agriculture) is presented. The model allows one to estimate how crop rotations and manure applications affect the amount of mineral nitrogen in different phases of a crop rotation. The model was tested on 8 organic farms and research sites. The model's performance was tested by means of visual performance and a number of statistical measures. The results show that the model fits the observed mineral nitrogen for the top 30 cm of the soil with a modelling efficiency (ME) of 0.4 and a coefficient of determination (r) of 0.65. NDICEA is used to gain insight into the different sources of N mineralisation in the soil. Results show that the model NDICEA can be used to simulate sustainable farming systems at the field level using on-farm data and readily available climatic data. The model might therefore serve as a tool for evaluating the impact of the crop rotation and manure regime on long-term soil fertility levels and nitrogen leaching losses at the field level.

AB We estimate the probability of deforestation at the plot level for Chiapas and Oaxaca, two poor Mexican states with high levels of biodiversity. Results highlight the importance of physio-geographic endowments as well as policy variables and allow to test explicitly for aggregation bias. They also suggest that, if combined with information on the biodiversity value of specific plots, such models could be of great relevance for policy by allowing to identify the ex ante risk of deforestation.

SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH

DT Article
AB Objectives. This study estimated the impact of red light camera enforcement on motor vehicle crashes in one of the first US communities to employ such cameras-Oxnard,California.
   Methods. Crash data were analyzed for Oxnard and for 3 comparison cities. Changes in crash frequencies were compared for Oxnard and control cities and for signalized and nonsignalized intersections by means of a generalized linear regression model.
   Results. Overall, crashes at signalized intersections throughout Oxnard were reduced by 7% and injury crashes were reduced by 29%. Right-angle crashes, those most associated with red light violations, were reduced by 32%; right-angle crashes involving injuries were reduced by 68%.
   Conclusions. Because red light cameras can be a permanent component of the transportation infrastructure, crash reductions attributed to camera enforcement should be sustainable.

ID CHRONIC FATIGUE SYNDROME; INFECTIOUS-MONONUCLEOSIS
AB Background: Functional endoscopic sinus surgery has remarkably improved the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis patients. Computed tomography, endoscopic optical instrumentation, powered microdebriders, and computer-assisted surgery have surmounted the technical problems of obstructive sinusitis care. Most experienced practitioners achieve reported success rates of 85-95% among their surgical patients. However, the 5-15% refractory patients reported by all rhinologic surgeons leave an exasperating and perplexing group who, despite appropriate mechanical corrections, continue to experience debilitating rhinosinusitis episodes requiring repeated oral, nebulized, or intravenous antibiotics, and in some cases, antifungal therapy.
   Methods: Recent studies have indicated that host immune response mechanisms may be altered in the paranasal sinus tissues of sinusitis patients. After years of observation, it was felt that these difficult patients may suffer from a common thread of significant partial immunocompromise. Drawing on military experience of treating immunoimmature populations prone to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infectious mononucleosis and the consequent postmononucleosis syndrome, it was sought to screen disabled refractory postsurgical sinusitis patients for this factor and treat them with long-standing military protocols for the immunoimmature populations dispatched to third-world combat conditions.
   Results: Treatment of Epstein-Barr Virus-Mild Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome consisted of periodic intramuscular serum immune globulin injections (immunomodulator therapy), after obtaining their thorough written informed consent, which produced substantial and sustainable improvement in patient's quality of life.
   Conclusion: Detection of mild-to-moderate acquired immune deficiency among postsurgical rhinosinusitis patients can lead to successful treatment and an improved quality of life.

LA English

ID VOLE MICROTUS-ARVALIS; REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS; SPAIN; DIET; PREY
AB The Montagu's harrier (Circus pygargus) is a ground-nesting raptor that breeds mainly in cereal crops in western Europe. We evaluate how the use of agricultural habitats may affect population sustainability in this species, based on simulation analyses, and explore how conservation measures could be optimized. Probability of extinction increased with decreasing harrier productivity, and this trend was accentuated when the carrying capacity (maximum number of breeding pairs) decreased. Harrier productivity in agricultural habitats is strongly affected by harvesting activities. An average of 60% of nestlings in agricultural areas of France and the Iberian Peninsula would perish in the absence of conservation measures. These losses would make populations unsustainable, if no immigration occurred. Simulation analyses showed that connectivity between populations through natal dispersal could allow persistence of threatened populations even in the absence of conservation measures. The probability of extinction of four hypothetical populations connected through natal dispersal would be lowest if one of those populations were fully protected (or fully productive), even if the other ones were unprotected. Montagu's harriers are semi-colonial, and populations could be considered as a compound of subpopulations (the colonies). Additionally, Montagu's harriers bred more frequently in areas where food abundance was high, and where the number of fledglings produced in the previous reproductive attempt was high. These factors could be used to develop sustainable and efficient conservation plans, identifying and protecting the most productive and stable colonies in agricultural areas, and further exploring experimentally factors that are likely to attract and maintain harriers in protected areas.

AB Science remains an eminently social institution, though the interactions between science and society are often poorly understood. This article addresses the context of recent efforts to identify environmental contributions to cancer. The authors first examine cancer incidence and discuss how incidence patterns may be related to air pollution and occupational and general toxic chemical and xenestrogen exposures. They then discuss the social context in which cancer research and treatment occurs, including the dominating role of the biomedical model and socioeconomic factors, including regulatory strategies that address single chemicals, corporate conflicts of interest, and the manipulation of public opinion. Last, they consider the broad context out of which cancer arises and discuss the merits of applying the precautionary principle to sustainable social policies. Progress in reducing cancer may be fruitfully made by returning our attention to broad-scale factors such as those affecting the quality of air, water, workplace, household environments, and the global climate.

AB In the past decade, an environmental health movement has developed, and a number of medical social movement organizations (MSMOs) participate in efforts to promote sustainability and protect the environment. Physicians have organized as part of the larger peace and social justice movements since the mid-1800s. While these larger movements are the subjects of substantial historical and sociological research, there is no scholarship about contemporary MSMOs. In particular, contributions from such scholarship are noticeably absent in discussions of the current crisis of medical professionalism. Physicians and their medical organizations have limited understandings of social movements, activist roles, and medicine, as the profession has not found solidarity with other classes and groups in pursuit of environmental health, human rights, or universal access to health care. Physicians for Social Responsibility, Physicians for Human Rights, and Physicians for a National Health Program are important exceptions.

AB 1. A dynamical and spatial simulation model of a harvested benthic ecosystem of central northern Chile (Tongoy Bay) was constructed using the ECOSPACE software package.
   2. In this system the red alga (Chondrocanthus chamissoi), the scallop (Argopecten pupuratus), the gastropod (Xanthochorus cassidiformis) and the crab (Cancer polyodon) are harvested intensively. The impacts of harvesting these resources exclusively in the seagrass, sand-gravel, and in the sand habitats, as well as, in the seagrass and sand-gravel and in all habitats were assessed. The goal was to explore policies of sustainable exploitation of the benthic systems.
   3. The most important findings were: (a) Fishing exclusively in either the seagrass or sand habitats produces a population increase in the sea star Luidia magallanica, in the seagrass Heterozostera tasmanica, and in the crab Paraxanthus barbiger. (b) Exclusive fishing in the sand-gravel habitat causes only small effects on the species and groups, which suggests that this habitat is the most resistant to harvest. (c) The simultaneous fishing on two or three habitats would produce the largest negative effect on the entire system. Therefore, a habitat rotation fishery is recommended.
   4. Our study suggests that trophic-spatially explicit models offer great possibilities for the screening and planning of effective interventions or manipulations of natural systems. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

DE fiscal sustainability; intergenerational equity; public policy
AB The authorities in a number of advanced countries have produced intergenerational reports that seek to determine the fiscal sustainability of current policy parameters. The Australian government will publish its Intergenerational Report in May 2002. This paper attempts to place these reports in analytical perspective. We examine the notion of intergenerational equity, the conceptual basis for generational accounting, Australian efforts at constructing generational accounts, and then review the intergenerational reports of several other countries. The paper concludes with a brief synoptic discussion of various policies that can help Australian governments achieve intergenerational balance future.

AB This paper is concerned with emerging trends within the delivery systems and financing methods of public and private infrastructure projects in the US, and with the ongoing debate on public/private partnerships. Project delivery methods and more generally the procurement policies that currently drive the management of the US infrastructure system are explored. The historical evolution of government procurement policies of facilities indicates a wide variety of strategies including a dual-track procurement strategy that used a combination of different delivery methods and, in many instances, private financing. The methods ranged from the combined procurement of the design, construction, operation and maintenance of a facility, such as Design-Build-Operate (DBO) and Design-Build-Finance-Operate (known outside the US as 'BOT'), to the separate procurement of these services, such as Design-Bid-Building (DBB) and Design-Build (DB). In the last 50 years, there has been a shift toward the exclusive reliance on separate procurement such as DBB and the use of public funding. This approach is not sustainable financially, considering the widening gap between the availability of public funds and the increasing needs of the existing infrastructure system. Some drivers that foster a possible future shift in public procurement procedures are highlighted as well as the development of a more efficient infrastructure management practice.

   HISTORY; DISTURBANCE; PATTERNS; CONSEQUENCES; RECRUITMENT; MANAGEMENT
AB Fire history and forest dynamics were reconstructed for a 3800-km(2) territory located in the south-central boreal forest of Quebec. Fire cycle was characterized using a random sampling strategy combined with archival data on fires that had occurred since 1923 on private land owned by Smurfit-Stone. Bioclimatic subdomain, land use, surficial deposit, and mean distance from a firebreak did not affect the fire cycle. Fire cycles have been longer since the end of the Little Ice Age (similar to1850). Warming after the Little Ice Age seems to have triggered a change in fire frequency. Forest dynamics were characterized by transition matrices for changes in dominant canopy composition from 344 permanent sampling plots. These permanent plots were sampled approximately every 15 years over the preceding 40 years. We observed two distinct patterns of replacement: (i) deciduous and mixed stands were replaced by balsam fir (Abies balsamifera (L.) Mill.) (and, to a lesser extent, by black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) BSP)) and (ii) jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.) was replaced by black spruce. Analyses confirm that species replacement occurs in the eastern boreal forest of Canada when the fire-return interval is long enough and that the substrate plays an important role along with other disturbances, such as insect outbreaks. Our results also suggest that the proportion of old-growth forests (>100 years old) in the landscape should increase as a result of the lengthening of the fire cycle. More and more stands are likely to experience species replacement. From the standpoint of sustainable forest management, this perspective calls into question the widespread use of clear-cutting in the boreal forest. Regional context must be taken into account in forest management if the conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem integrity are serious objectives. Economically and ecologically sound silvicultural scenarios that emulate natural processes are discussed.

AB Soils in southern Spain are low in organic matter (OM) and nutrients. Understanding the nature and dynamics of OM has potential to improve soil management technologies for sustainable crop production. The objective of this work was to establish the distribution of functional groups in organic-C from these soils using C-13 CP/MAS-NMR spectroscopy and to investigate the influence of vegetation, climatic conditions, soil parameters, parent material, and soil order on these functional groups. No statistically significant variability in the distribution of organic-C groups was found as a result of the influence of either soil order or parent material. The content of O-alkyl-C in the soils under the Rhamno-Quercetum plant community was higher (95% probability) than in the soils under the Paronychio-Sideritidetum plant community. Soils located in the mesomediterranean climatic zone displayed a higher content of O-alkyl-C and a lower content of aromatic-C compared to the soils located in the thermomediterranean zone. These differences were statistically significant at 95% of probability. Vegetation and climatic conditions appear to play a major role in the OM decomposition processes in this region. Statistically significant and positive correlations were found between alkyl-C and both cation exchange capacity (CEC) and clay content indicating the recalcitrant nature of these organic compounds.

Results indicated that significant spatial variability of all essential plant nutrient exist in different operating systems and at various scales. Under small scale operation within the family responsibility system, in which each farmer's family is assigned to operate one or several small field plots with the field size normally less than one hectare, the large spatial variability of soil nutrients was mainly attributed to the fertilizer history of individual farmers, diversity of crop types and varieties used in relatively small scale field management. Significant correlation was found between crop yields and available soil nutrient levels at the corresponding sites in the field. Based on the understanding of the nature of spatial variability of soil nutrient availability in China, and with the purpose of increasing profitability and sustainability of crop production, a site-specific soil nutrient management strategy is proposed. Related techniques and agricultural services are discussed, including soil testing and fertilizer recommendation, farmers' plot specific or regional specific fertilization approaches and related services at national and regional levels.

AB The coffee disease complex known as corky-root, composed of the root-knot nematode Meloidogyne arabicida and Fusarium oxysporum, causes serious damage to Coffea arabica in Costa Rica. Resistance to Meloidogyne arabicida alone and to the field population (M. arabicida, M. exigua, F oxysporum) was evaluated under controlled and field conditions. The studied material consisted of subspontaneous-derived C arabica accessions, C canephora accessions, introgression lines derived from the interspecific Timor Hybrid (C arabica x C canephora) and F I hybrids from crosses between subspontaneous-derived accessions and cultivars. Accessions resistant to M. arabicida and to the field population were identified at varying frequencies in the different groups of study materials. The results showed that resistance to corky-root is heritable and that genetic resistance to M. arabicida is an effective strategy against corky-root disease. By using C canephora rootstocks, it was possible to substantially reduce mortality in the field and reduce by half the number of plants with corky-root symptoms. The results were used to define appropriate strategies for the sustainable management of coffee corky-robt disease resistance. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID REGRESSION
AB American farmers do not always choose sustainable insect management practices, even when they can improve their farm economic and environmental conditions by doing so. Organic farmers are dependent on alternative, biology-based insect control methods and are innovative in their on-farm experimentation with new strategies. By understanding the factors that influence the insect management portfolio chosen by organic farmers, research and education programs to promote sustainable insect management practices for all farmers may be devised. A negative binomial model of the factors influencing the number of alternative insect management practices adopted is applied to survey data from American organic farmers. It is found that college-educated farmers with smaller acreages, more than half their acreage in horticultural production, and extensive experience with organic production methods, have the greatest diversity in their insect management portfolios. There is a strong indication that on a regional basis, uncertainty over institutional and infrastructure support for organic agriculture results in the adoption of more strategies. Recommendations include more support for farmer information exchanges and mentoring programs that rely on the expertise of organic farmers, and more funding for farmer-driven organic research that can be extended to all farm populations.

DT Article
DE hydropower; renewable; sustainable
AB Central and State Governments in many countries have enacted laws and regulations to promote renewable energy and to encourage sustainable technologies. In doing so, they had to define what they meant by "renewable" and "sustainable", and they had to decide which particular technologies or organizations would be eligible for subsidies and tax concessions, and which others would be excluded. Not infrequently, a considerable amount of lobbying would precede the passage of such laws and regulations, and the resulting definitions of "renewable" and "sustainable" are often different than their original meaning. As a result, there now exist many laws or regulations, which define "small hydro" as renewable and sustainable, whereas "large hydro" is labeled by some of the legislators as being either not renewable or not sustainable. To further complicate matters, the definition of "small hydro" varies widely from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, from as little as I MW capacity to as much as 100 MW capacity. This article traces society's increasing preoccupation with renewability and sustainability issues over the past few decades, and addresses the question of whether large hydropower should be considered renewable and sustainable.

DE hydropower; sustainable; environment
AB Hydroelectricity represents a large-scale alternative to fossil fuel generation, contributing only very small amounts to greenhouse gas emissions and other atmospheric pollutants. However, developing the remaining hydroelectric potential offers many challenges. Public pressure and expectations regarding the environmental and social performance of hydropower tend to increase over time. Moreover, in the context of the restructuring of the electricity sector, markets may favor more polluting (and less costly) options. This article, based on an International Energy Agency initiative on hydropower, proposes a set of actions to meet these challenges and develop the remaining hydropower potential in a sustainable way. It is the role of Governments to put forward policies and regulations that do not unduly favor or penalize specific power generation options, while effectively protecting the environment and the rights of affected populations. In setting up such policies and regulations, the positive externalities of hydropower-versatility of energy services, very few regional or global impacts, flood control, etc-should be clearly recognized. The industry also has a central role to play. Environmental mitigation measures and compensation for persons and communities affected by hydropower projects are well understood today, and should be universally applied. Developers have the responsibility to fully integrate appropriate measures into project design. This also means eliminating unacceptable alternatives early in the planning process, allowing for full community participation, and sharing project benefits with local populations.

AB Critical power (CP) is a theoretical construct derived from a series of constant load tests to failure. Many studies have examined the methodological limitations of deriving CP, but few studies have examined the responses to exercise at CP in well-trained individuals. The purpose of the present study was to examine the physiological responses to exercise at CP. Seven male subjects [mean (SD) body mass 75.6 (6.4) kg, maximum oxygen uptake 4.6 (0.7) 1 min(-1)] performed three constant load tests to derive CP. Subjects then exercised at CP until volitional exhaustion. Heart rate, oxygen consumption and blood lactate concentration were measured throughout. Repeated measures analysis of variance revealed significant differences over time in heart rate 118 (24) to 177(5) beats min(-1), oxygen consumption 3.7 (0.6) to 4.1 (0.5) 1 min(-1) and blood lactate concentration 4.3 (1.8) to 6.5 (2.0) mM. All seven subjects completed 20 min of exercise with the range of time to failure at CP from 20 min 1 s to 40 min 37 s. Time to failure and maximum oxygen consumption were significantly correlated (r=0.779, P<0.05). We conclude, therefore, that CP does not represent a sustainable steady-state intensity of exercise.

AB This paper evaluates a programme called FOCUS in Zimbabwe: Families, Orphans, and Children under Stress. The programme was initiated in 1993 and works with seven community groups, providing support to around 6500 children in 2000 households. The programme succeeds through committed community volunteers, who made over 93,000 visits to households in 1999. Communities are mobilised by building on existing practices, using natural entry points, and careful selection of local volunteers and supervisors. There is good community ownership, extremely low volunteer turnover, and reporting systems verify that aims and objectives are met. The programme maintains good ethics, addresses a range of children's rights, and is sustainable through a mixture of donor funds, FACT (sponsoring organisation) support and community support. Issues of concern include better recognition of psycho-social needs, prevention and protection from sexual abuse, reducing stigma and discrimination, increasing child-centred approaches and participation, and reducing gender imbalance among volunteers.

AB This study reports on a pilot project, the greater involvement of people living with HIV/AIDS Workplace Model, which places trained fieldworkers living openly with HIV/AIDS in selected partner organisations sectors, where they set up, review or enrich work-place policies and programmes. The project adds credibility to partners' HIV/AIDS programmes and creates a supportive environment for people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) and others to speak about HIV/AIDS. Eleven men and women living with HIV, aged between 30 and 45, and with varied life experiences and education levels, shared a willingness to speak about their HIV status in their workplace. They worked in very different environments but their collective experiences showed that PLWHA can add value to workplace HIV/AIDS programmes in a way that is relevant, effective, efficient, sustainable and ethical. They made companies and communities more aware of the intense need for HIV/AIDS policies and encouraged care and support for infected and affected people. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Long-term fertility experiments (LTFEs) are a tool to investigate the sustainability of cropping systems. Several LTFEs for intensive irrigated rice cropping were established in Asia, but those are rare in Sub-Saharan Africa. Two such trials are presented, both located in the Sahel savanna vegetation zone in Senegal. The trials were established in 199 1, contain six different fertilizer treatments and rice is grown two times per year. Soil type at Ndiaye is a typical Orthithionic Gleysol and an Eutric Vertisol at Fanaye. Average grain yields without fertilizer application were 3.4 Mg ha(-1) per season in Ndiaye and 2.9 Mg ha(-1) per season in Fanaye. In 20 consecutive seasons best treatments at both sites and in both seasons yielded on average between 6.7 and 7.6 Mg ha(-1) per crop. Yield components were influenced by cultivar, site, season and fertilizer treatment. The mineral composition of grains was homogenous between cultivars and similar to results from Asia, Australia and the USA. Significant differences among cultivars were found for the mineral composition of straw, especially for Si, Fe, Zn and K. Nitrogen, P and K fertilizer treatments increased the mineral concentrations of N, P, Mg, Ca, Mn and Cu. Highest yields in the LTFE indicate a not significant yield decline of -27 kg per season in Ndiaye and a significant increase in Fanaye (+86 kg per season). The crop model ORYZAS simulated that potential yields declined by -50 kg per season in Ndiaye and increased by + 16 kg per season in Fanaye (not significant). Simulated yield trends were not always mirrored by trends of average seasonal radiation, which is due to the influence of unfavorable temperature extremes on yield and yield simulations. It is concluded that observed yield trends can largely be explained by climatic influences. The agronomic analysis did not indicate a negative impact of intensive irrigated rice cropping on the soil resource base. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Nutrient fluxes were quantified in a chronosequence of three Douglas-fir stands in the Monts du Beaujolais (France). Measurements were taken for 6 years. Current annual and seasonal budgets were calculated and budgets for three theoretical rotation lengths were simulated.
   Results showed that current budgets were negative for most elements in the young stand, but that the deficit decreased with stand age. The budgets were balanced or positive in the older stand. Element deficits in the young stand were related to biomass accumulation and to considerable losses in seepage waters. High nitrification levels related to past land uses were responsible for leaching losses of nitrates and cations. Atmospheric deposition of nitrogen was an additional constraint in this N-saturated ecosystem.
   Simulated element budgets showed that whole tree harvesting should not be prescribed in these stands. Even when stem-only harvesting was practised, the balancing of the nutrient budgets would require a rotation length between 100 and 120 years, which is both technically and economically unrealistic. Sustainable management of such high production Douglas-fir forests would require nutrient inputs from fertilisation to maintain soil quality and their capacity to produce biomass at high rates.

AB Clonal Eucalyptus plantations in the Pointe-Noire region have been established on sandy and nutrient poor soils, and carry potential risk of depleting water and nutrient. To assess these risks, water and nutrient budgets should be calculated. However, the accuracy of hydrological models is strongly dependent on a realistic description of root distribution in soil. The spatial distribution of root systems in a chronosequence of clonal stands was then studied, using root intersect counting. The stands were 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years and 9 years old. For each stand we studied three vertical profiles perpendicular to the planting row at different spacing from a representative tree. The profiles were divided into square grid cells of 25 cm, and the number of roots belonging to three diameter classes (between 0.1 and 1, 1 and 10 mm, and over 10 mm) were counted in each grid cell. The profiles were 2.50 m wide (half the distance between the planting rows) and 3 m deep, except for the two youngest stands (1.5 m deep). Spatial statistical analyses and analysis of variance were carried out to describe root distributions and their spatial and temporal changes. We observed that:
   (1) The trees quickly developed an extensive root system. One year after planting the root system extended to depth beyond 3 m deep and up to the middle of the inter-row.
   (2) Root density decreased sharply with depth, with most fine roots in the surface layers. The number of fine root intersects in the 0-25 cm surface soil layer represented 16-53% of the total throughout the profile depending on stand age and the type of profile.
   (3) The percentage of root intersects in surface layers increased with stand age: this may reflect the greater concentration of nutrients in surface layers.
   (4) High variability in root densities was observed in the surface soil layers but no gradient of decrease from the planting row to the middle of the inter-row could be underscored. However, the highest root densities were generally observed under the stump.
   These patterns of distribution allow rapid access to soil water and nutrients, reduce loss by deep drainage, and may partially explain the fairly high productivity of these plantations. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The area and percent of forest land with significantly diminished soil organic matter (SOM) and/or changes in other soil chemical properties has been proposed as a regional sustainability, indicator for Australia's forests. This study examined for native eucalypt forest in south-eastern Australia how representative soil organic carbon (SOC) is of important ecosystem properties and processes. In addition, it was investigated how sensitive the proposed indicator is to management-induced disturbance of these forests. Three sites in Victoria with a known disturbance history and a mapped distribution of soil disturbance (different intensities of fire, snig tracks, and soil perturbation) were included. These sites (2 x Eucalyptus regnans, 1 X Eucalyptus sieberi) had been clearfelled 9-10 years prior to sampling. The fine-soil fraction (<2 mm) was analysed for SOC, microbial C and N, mineralisable C and N, and available P. In addition, SOC was determined in rocks, plant residues, and charcoal in the fraction greater than 2 mm. Non-labile SOC in the fine-soil fraction contributed to 47-66% of the total in soil profiles (litter layer and 0-30 cm mineral soil). Charcoal in the >2 turn fraction contributed to 13-27% of total SOC. The relationships between SOC and measures of organic matter quality and N and P availability were inconsistent across sites and management practices. The effects of disturbance were most pronounced in the surface soil (0-7.5 cm). Including deeper soil layers in the statistical analysis diluted disturbance effects. Significant differences in the SOC content between soil disturbance intensities in the fine-soil fraction disappeared when size fractions >2 mm were considered. In addition, soil compaction masked changes in SOC concentration in some cases, when SOC was expressed on a volume basis. When all size fractions were considered, SOC stocks increased with fire intensity as a result of charcoal inputs. Physical soil disturbance appeared to be more critical for regrowth productivity than the effects of slash fires. Our results showed that the proposed indicator, changes in SOC, does not meet several of the attributes of what is commonly regarded as a good ecological indicator. Of particular concern are the changes in SOC resulting from charcoal inputs, which are difficult to interpret with regard to soil fertility. Without further qualifications, the changes in SOC cannot be recommended for implementation as an indicator of sustainable soil management in native eucalypt forests. Alternative approaches for the monitoring of changes in soil properties are discussed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Sustainability related soil changes due to site disturbance during forest harvesting need to be assessed. Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) may be useful for assessing large numbers of samples covering a landscape and dispersed over a long time span. This paper presents an evaluation of the use of NIRS to examine a number of chemical and biological soil properties. One hundred and twenty soil samples were collected from two mountain ash sites in Victoria, Australia, 10 years after forest harvesting. The sites had received a number of site and slash management treatments. Samples were analysed for total contents of C, N, microbial C (Cmic) and N (Nmic), various indices of available soil P and N content in salt solutions. To determine the potentially mineralisable C and N, samples were incubated for 264 days during which CO2 evolution and N mineralisation were periodically determined. For each sample the reflectance spectrum was collected in the NIR (including the visible) range between 400 and 2500 nm. The sample set was broken up randomly for the calibration (n = 40) and validation (n = 80) and the entire spectrum was used to obtain the most suited mathematical (zeroth, first, second or third derivative) results. The validation showed that NIRS was very useful to predict the contents of C and N, and cumulative respiration and N mineralised after 264 days. The slopes (a) of linear regression (measured against predicted values) ranged from 0.9 to 1.1 and correlation coefficients (r) were greater or equal to 0.9. NIRS was quite useful (r greater than or equal to 0.8, 0.8 less than or equal to a less than or equal to 1.2) to predict Cmic, cumulative respiration and N mineralisation after 53 days, potentially mineralisable C, and Olsen R For Nmic, the predictions were less satisfactory (a < 0.8). NIRS failed to predict extractable Bray-II P, long-term available P, extractable mineral N and different ratios (C/N, C/Cmic, N/Nmic and Cmic/Nmic). The promising results obtained for C, N, Olsen P, Cmic, cumulative N and C mineralised, and potentially mineralisable C warrant further testing and use of this simple method for a wide range of samples.

AB Trees are being established on substantial areas of Australian farmland, often extending into districts where forestry has not been previously practiced. Irrespective of purpose-wood production, increased water use, erosion control, habitat restoration, carbon sequestration or bio-energy production-the benefits of farm forestry depend on tree survival and adequate growth. Site assessment has been mainly used for the prediction of tree performance but it can be extended to form the basis for site-specific management. Site assessment needs to provide information on species and management inputs suitable to a site's inherent environmental attributes so that the aim of maximum profitability can be achieved while maintaining a sustainable use of resources.
   A new site concept for farm forestry is presented that reflects these factors. This new site concept is defined as the integrated effect of environmental factors that influence the potential growth of a particular tree genotype and affect the soil management of that stand of trees to produce a particular product or output. This concept of site is environment-based, independent of the presence of trees, and includes an explicit acknowledgement of a hierarchy of scale (both spatial and temporal) and how it affects what environmental factors need to be assessed.
   The goal for site assessment for farm forestry is to develop pragmatic, robust and quantitative interpretations from the measured data to aid multiple aspects of plantation management. A pragmatic approach to field survey is required, with data gathering (whether morphological, analytical or electronic) being based on demonstrated benefit rather than routine prescription, guess-work or tradition. Site assessment needs to be linked to well-designed species trials and permanent growth plots so continual evolution and improvement of edaphic and silvicultural relationships can be incorporated into future modifications.

AB The current South African forest resource is managed through intensive silviculture of fast-growing exotic species. Increased intensity in managed practices in a forestry environment that is characterised by diversity in growing conditions, will require reliable decision support tools that facilitate informed decision making. This paper highlights the conceptual approach of forest site classification, the development of site evaluation models, and the formulation of management systems and policies. The multi-factor, hierarchical approach to site classification used in South Africa is discussed against an international perspective, and possible future directions are highlighted. A review is provided on the outcome of site-growth studies undertaken in South Africa, and the importance of development towards process-based models is indicated. The highly variable, site-specific response found with fertiliser trials is outlined, and the importance of site-classification systems in formulating nutrient management policies is also highlighted. The status of growth and yield modelling in South Africa is briefly discussed, including the crucial role of site-classification systems in developing site-specific growth models. The development of a policy regarding sustainable forest management is a priority, and the importance of spatial site information in this venture is discussed. The integration of the three different concepts; site classification, site evaluation and management systems, into a common platform for decision making, is proposed. Together with geographic information technology, these integrated components can form the, essential elements to a forest management decision support system. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB The annual phytoproductivity (APP) of the main Estonian postlithogenic mineral soils (Leptosols, Cambisols, Luvisols, Albehivisols, Podzols and Gleysols), which form 61.3% of the areas covered with forest, was analysed. The quantitative data on soil cover properties and plant cover (phytocoenosis) productivity originates from the database PEDON, which consists of 195 research areas on soils mentioned above. The APP was determined for stems of trees (APPs; n = 195) and for the whole part of vegetation aboveground (APPa; it = 79). The total annual phytoproductivity (APPt) was calculated indirectly for nine soil groups using allometric relationships suitable for different ecosystem types, as well as by formulas for determining APPt after soil group positions on the scales of moisture conditions and soil mineral-chemical composition (or throphic condition) on the Estonian soil ordination net. Relationships between soil groups and forest site types as well as humus cover types were also developed. In the frigid udic (49%) frigid aquic (47%) and frigid aridic (4%) pedoclimatic conditions, the APPa varied from 2.8 to 14.5 Mg ha(-1). The highest productivity (10.4 +/- 1.4 Mg ha(-1)) was obtained for Luvisols. The dominating forest site type on these soils is Aegopodium and Hepatica and the prevalent humus cover type is moist and fresh moder-mull. Epigleyic and Fibrihistic Podzols have the lowest productivity (3.7 +/- 0.5 Mg ha(-1)) where the forest site type was Vaccinium and the humus cover type was peaty mor. The site productivity was determined first of all by pools of physical clay in solum and metric layer of soil cover. The pools of organic matter did not show a notable positive correlation with soil productivity. For the sustainable management of forest areas, it is important to contribute to the formation of stabilised forest ecosystems by achieving adequacy between the forest vegetation and site characteristics.

AB Since 1978, 42,000 ha of clonal. Eucalyptus plantations have been established around Pointe-Noire. These plantations are growing on sandy and acidic soils with small reserves of available nutrients; therefore, risks of nutrient deficiencies exist in the medium or long-term. The effects of slash and litter management practices on soil properties, tree nutrition and growth were quantified to evaluate harvesting methods with respect to sustainable management of the replanted sites. The experimental design was a randomized complete block with four replications and six treatments: R, all aboveground organic residues removed; WTH, whole-trees harvested and removed; SBH, stemwood and bark removed; SH, stemwood-only removed; DS, double slash retained; B, stemwood-only removed and all organic residues burned. After 12 months removal of all slash material (R) had a marked negative effect on total biomass (5.9 t ha(-1) vs a mean of 7.2 t ha(-1) for the other treatments). During the first 18 months of the study no significant differences among treatments were detected (P < 0.05), but at 24 months, tree growth was significantly reduced where all organic residues were removed (R), compared to DS (12.9 m(3) ha(-1) per year vs 22.2 m(3) ha(-1) per year). The best growth was measured in plots with the highest organic residues (treatments DS and SH). Nutrient content in the aboveground biomass of the 1-year-old stand was strongly dependent on the type of slash and litter management. Differences in tree nutrient concentrations in various treatments demonstrated the ability of trees to store available nutrients in aboveground biomass. The rate of decomposition of organic residues during the first 8 months after harvesting ranged from 36% (WTH) to 56% (SH). Between 7 and 24 months, the annual production of inorganic nitrogen in the top soil (0-13 cm layer) was 71.6, 66.7, and 85.7 kg ha(-1) per year for R, SH, and DS, respectively. The rate of soil nitrification was high, and therefore nitrogen leaching may have occurred in the early development stage when trees are not able to take up all the available nitrogen.

AB Representative samples of the British and Norwegian population were surveyed by. telephone and asked to make a hypothetical choice between unlabeled wooden furniture and more expensive eco-labeled wooden furniture. Choice behavior was modeled as a random utility model with utility-theoretic restrictions on choice and estimated willingness to pay (WTP). To counteract upward biased hypothetical values, a followup question assessed the certainty of respondents' choices. For those not choosing the eco-labeled alternative, another followup question assessed if these individuals could be regarded as indifferent.
   Compared to the unlabeled wooden furniture with a price of US$332 in the UK and US$275 in Norway, the extra median WTP for the eco-labeled alternative was estimated to be US$5.16 (1.6%) in the UK and US$2.79 (1%) in Norway, with a censored log-logistic binary choice model. In these estimates only the "absolutely sure" were counted as valid choices of the eco-labeled alternative. The censoring implied that those who indicated indifference between unlabeled and eco-labeled furniture had their estimated WTP adjusted to 0. About 39% of the UK population and 32% of the Norwegian population are predicted to choose the eco-labeled alternative when the price difference is less than 5%.

AB Recent concerns regarding non-timber forest product (NTFP) management are focused on raw material production, BLit NTFP ought to be viewed from the perspective of ecological processes, cultural heritage. livelihood of local people, economic values and incentives for forest management. This broader role for NTFP cannot be realised by simply domesticating a few species, Integration of NTFP in forest management is necessary in order to achieve sustainable forestry. Because forestry technologies are de eloped with timber values uppermost, it is vital to develop forest management technologies that take into account both timber and non-timber values. Global examples show that traditional knowledge could play a vital role while developing silvicultural regimes, and in situ experimentation will strengthen the regimes. Guidelines for ethnobotanical studies are briefly presented.

AB Forests continue to play a critical part in the spiritual and cultural life of Aboriginal people. In turn, Aboriginal people are striving to revitalize their role in maintaining a healthy relationship with these ecosystems. In Canada, the past two centuries have seen Aboriginal people largely excluded from forest management activities. This has begun to gradually change due to ongoing Aboriginal efforts in the courts as well as to national and international recognition of the potential contribution of Indigenous Knowledge to sustainable forest management. Such change is bringing about new opportunities for the meaningful involvement of Aboriginal people and Indigenous Knowledge in sustainable forest management activities. The increasing participation of Aboriginal people in sustainable forest management is both called for and reflected in various forest policies. practices and programs in Canada. While this represents a positive development. the degree and type of Aboriginal involvement called for have thus far generally been unsatisfactory from an Aboriginal perspective. Interviews conducted with both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal participants in Ontario's new forest management planning process indicate that this recently developed process has nonetheless yielded some hopeful results in terms of Aboriginal involvement in certain instances. It was found that both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal interview respondents most often described the Aboriginal consultation process to be a success where control over the nature and methods of sharing of information was relinquished to the participating Aboriginal communities. Contexts and implications of these findings are briefly discussed.

DE NTFP; sustainability; biodiversity; community forestry
AB Non-timber forest products (NTFP) are emerging globally as a tool for the establishment of sustainable forest communities. They provide employment to various sectors of society. draw on local expertise and culture. and increase the outputs of forests. In recent years, NTFP have received accrued interest by the general public, governments and the private sectors of Canada. However, for the NTFP industry to enter mainstream Canadian industrial culture it is now critical to attempt the integration of the timber industry with the NTFP industry to benefit both sectors. NTFP can be harvested from four types of environment: wild stocks from timber-productive forests, wild stocks from non-timber-productive forests or lands. managed stocks from intensively managed forests, and domesticated stocks from agricultural systems. A large body of evidence suggests that NTFP management and harvest can serve the forest industry in many ways. There a-re four possible types of interaction between the NTFP and timber industries: independent resource use, competition for resources, complementary resource use and symbiotic resource use. Integration of both industries in a sustainable manner will need to be supported with research that address economic, social. policy and ecological questions.

AB Forest management practices that decrease soil porosity and remove organic matter can reduce site productivity. We evaluated effects of four treatments-merchantable bole harvest (MBH) with three levels of soil compaction (none, light, or heady), and total woody vegetation harvest plus forest floor removal (FFR)-on fifth-year regeneration and growth of aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) growing on soils with similar textures (20-40 cm silt loam over clay loam till) in northern Minnesota (MN) and northeastern British Columbia (BC). Overall mean sucker density was significantly greater in BC than in MN, and mean height was significantly lower. Soil compaction did not affect sucker density in BC. but significantly reduced it in MN, primarily due to late spring treatment. In BC, mean sucker heights generally decreased with level of compaction, but only the differences between non-compacted and the heavy compaction treatments were significant. On the MN plots, sucker heights were reduced significantly by compaction, Treatment responses were similar on both sites: (1) the greatest sucker densities were in the FFR treatment (2) greatest mean heights were on the non-compacted]MBH plots and were significantly greater than those in the FFR treatment (3) sucker heights generally decreased with level of compaction; and (4) soil compaction decreased the number of suckers that had reached a dbh of 25 mm after five years and will likely delay future stand development and reduce site productivity.

TI Sustainable technologies and the innovation - regulation paradox
SO FUTURES
LA English
DT Article
AB This article examines the paradox between innovation and regulation and its implication for the adoption of sustainable technologies in the domestic sector of the construction industry. The case of UK is examined, where progress towards the inclusion of social and environmental considerations has been slow. Recent change in attitude in the private sector, combined with government initiatives, has prompted a more sustainable agenda in construction. With significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions required to meet climate change targets, the case for a particular energy-saving technology-natural thermal insulation materials for cavity wall insulation-suitable for widespread use in residential buildings, is assessed. In addition to the inherent conservatism in the construction industry, additional barriers inhibiting the uptake of new sustainable thermal insulation technologies include capital costs, the failure of the market to account for social and environmental costs and savings and their perceived cost-effectiveness and performance over a 50-year lifetime. Policy implications are drawn from the analysis. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper addresses a new way of influencing and stimulating technological innovations towards sustainability. Sustainability is operationalised as function fulfilment with a factor of 20 reduction on environmental burden over the entire lifecycle. The method, which is derived from the earlier developed sustainable technological development (STD) and SusHouse methods, includes future visioning together with stakeholder participation, followed by action planning. Future visioning has been carried out in workshops with all relevant stakeholders; action planning is also performed in workshops. As a case study a polymeric coatings chain in the Netherlands and in Portugal, has been chosen. Initially data has been gathered about production, environmental aspects, and technological innovations and applications; later interviews with stakeholders have been carried out followed by the visioning and action planning workshops. The paper shows that the methodology works in a situation in which innovative activity is already under way, identifying new and unexpected ways of making the polymeric coatings chain more sustainable. It discusses further implementation of new ideas of function fulfilment. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Chronostratigraphic approaches to coastal geomorphology frequently include consideration of salt marsh deposits as indicators of past sea-level positions. Continuous horizons of such deposits can be used to infer that salt marshes were keeping pace with local rates of relative sea-level rise (RSLR). Rates of past accumulation, estimated using dating techniques, are then used to hindcast the rate of sea-level rise in that area. Estimates of contemporary sea-level rise rates are often derived from tide gauge records. This approach allows identification of subdecadal variations in mean water level. Accumulation rates of both organic and inorganic sediments can also be derived at these time scales and studies from many coastal marshes demonstrate the episodic nature of inorganic sediment deposition. The frequency and spacing of these events does not necessarily coincide with periods of increased local sea level. In addition, short-term increases in sea level could result in marsh deterioration as soils become excessively waterlogged. A conceptual model of changes in geomorphic and ecological processes contributing to marsh sustainability during the Holocene has been developed for the Mississippi delta plain (MDP). The survival of some marshes in this area, despite high rates of subsidence, indicates that the combined effect of organic and inorganic accumulation processes can be adequate to sustain coastal marshes in the face of sea-level rise.

AB The water balance of Lake Naivasha, has been calculated from a model based upon the long- term meteorological data of rainfall, evaporation and river inflows. The lake is Kenya's second Ramsar site because of its international importance as a wetland, but supplies drinking water to Nakuru and irrigation water to the nationally important industries of horticulture and power generation. Groundwater flows into and out of the lake are estimated from the model's success in predicting water level fluctuations over the same period. The most accurate predictions of lake level were derived from the data sets of river discharges known to be from the most- reliable time period and gauging stations. The model estimated a current annual abstraction rate of 60 x 10(6) m(3) ann(-1), a figure perhaps six- times higher than that calculated as a ' safe' yield in the 1980s. There is an urgent need to accurately measure all abstractions and provide consistent, reliable, hydrological and meteorological data from the catchment, so that a ' safe' yield may be agreed upon by all stakeholders and sustainable use of the lake waters achieved.

ID TROPICAL SWAMP; SEDIMENTS
AB The loss of phosphorus from the catchment of Lake Naivasha, Kenya, was 0.2 kg ha(-1) ann(-1), 76% of it particulate in a ' normal' year of wet and dry periods. It rose to a mean of 1.8 kg ha(-1) ann(-1), 90% of which was particulate, in the months following the extreme rainfall which followed the 1997 - 1998 El Nino event in the Southern Atlantic. Total and particulate phosphorus were positively correlated with suspended solids and with discharge, and conductivity was negatively correlated with discharge. The magnitude of losses pose both threats to the water quality of Lake Naivasha and to the sustainable soils resources of the catchment.

AB Sustainable development remains a pressing priority for the Lake Naivasha Ramsar site, as a matter both of longterm protection of the lake ecosystem and of the economic and social progress that depends upon it. This must be addressed at catchment- scale to protect the ' ecosystem services' that constitute the region's primary resources. Sustainability principles highlight energy, fertilisers, pesticides and other aspects of chemical use, plastics, erosion and sedimentation, wildlife, water and socio- economic issues as central to sustainable development strategy, influenced by both intensive and subsistence farms across the catchment. Market forces and long- term self- interest provide compelling arguments for sustainable development, the delivery of which will depend upon education and the spreading of good practice, perhaps backed up by stewardship schemes. Alternatively, the adverse consequences of continued unsustainable practice are highly significant for the region.

AB This 64-b microprocessor is the second-generation design of the new Itanium architecture, termed explicitly parallel instruction computing (EPIC). The design seeks to extract maximum performance from EPIC by optimizing the memory system and execution resources for a combination of high bandwidth and low latency. This is achieved by tightly coupling microarchitecture choices to innovative circuit designs and the capabilities of the transistors and wires in the.18-mum bulk Al metal process [16]. The key features of this design are: a short eight-stage pipeline, 11 sustainable issue ports (six Integer, four floating point, half-cycle access level-1 caches, 64-GB/s level-2 cache and 3-MB level-3 cache, all integrated on a 421 mm(2) die. The chip operates at over 1 GHz and is built on significant advances in CMOS circuits and methodologies. After providing an overview of the processor microarchitecture and design, this paper describes a few of these key enabling circuits and design techniques.

AB This paper uses the device of imagining Education personnel at the World Bank engaging in study and discussion that causes them to rethink their 1999 Education Sector Strategy document. The Bank's educators discuss issues that lead them to see that the World Bank's assumptions of human capital theory are deficient. Having studied the severe limitations in the effectiveness of the education reforms of several countries, they admit not only that the education model being promoted by the Bank is flawed, but also that its preferred paradigm of modernist development is unsustainable. Thanks to the program of study and reflection, Bank educators decide to meet the challenge of reinventing themselves as educators collaborating with their national clients in developing new paradigms in which both creative education and sustainable development can flourish.

DE sustainable hydrogen
AB Towards a sustainable energy supply is a clear direction for exploratory research in Shell. Examples of energy carriers, which should be delivered to the envisaged sustainable energy markets, are bio-fuels, produced from biomass residues, and hydrogen (or electricity), produced from renewable sources. In contrast to the readily available ancient sunlight stored in fossil fuels, the harvesting of incident sunlight will be intermittent, efficient electricity and hydrogen storage technologies need to be developed. Research to develop those energy chains is going on, but the actual transformation from current fossil fuel based to sustainable energy markets will take a considerable time. In the meantime the fossil fuel based energy markets have to be transformed to mitigate the impact of the use of fossil fuels. Some elements in this transformation are fuels for ultra-clean combustion (hydrocarbons and oxygenates), hydrogen from fossil fuels, fuels for processors for fuel cells, carbon sequestration.

AB This paper reviews information from continuous laboratory studies of fermentative hydrogen production useful when considering practical applications of the technology. Data from reactors operating with pure cultures and mixed microflora enriched from natural sources are considered. Inocula have been derived from heat-treated anaerobically digested sludge, activated sludge, aerobic compost and soil, and non-heat-treated aerobically composted activated sludge. Most studies are on soluble defined substrates, and there are few reports of continuous operation on complex substrates with mixed microflora, to produce H-2. Methanogenesis which consumes H-2 May be prevented by operation at short hydraulic retention times (around 8-12 h on simple substrates) and/or pH below 6. Although the reactor technology for anaerobic digestion and biohydrogen production from complex substrates may be similar, there are important microbiological differences, including the need to manage spore germination and oxygen toxicity on start-up and control sporulation in adverse circumstances during reactor operation.

TI Making biodiversity meaningful through environmental education
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID SCIENCE
AB Biodiversity is an emerging theme in science, society and, more recently, education. There is no one single definition of biodiversity that is adequate in all situations. Both the knowledge base and the value base of biodiversity are variable and questionable. Because of these characteristics, biodiversity makes for an interesting vehicle for linking science and society, and the investigation of the normative underpinnings of 'science-in-the making'. Based on a 3-year study, this paper explores the crossroads between science education and environmental education and presents a framework for tapping the environmental education potential of biodiversity. Outlined are a number stepping stones for making biodiversity meaningful to learners. It is argued that, from the perspective of environmental education, the ill-defined nature of biodiversity is a useful feature. Biodiversity is renewing the discourse on nature conservation issues by bringing together different groups in society that are searching for a common language to discuss nature conservation issues in relation to sustainability issues. The resulting debate allows the socio-scientific dispute character of 'science-in-the-making' to surface. Participation in such a dispute is an excellent opportunity to learn about a highly relevant, controversial, emotionally charged and debatable topic at the crossroads of science, technology and society.

TI Mutualism: a different agenda for environmental and science education
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper discusses the history of the relationship between science education and environmental education in Australian and international contexts and argues that - given the on-going resistances to environmental education in schools, the static nature of science education practices, and declining student interest in studying traditional science subject - it is time to reconsider the relationship. If we are to achieve sustainable development, then science education must have a role in encouraging ecological thinking. However, the science education that can be an appropriate 'host' for environmental education is not necessarily that currently practised, but a reconceptualized form could well be what is needed. From a historical perspective this paper suggests that it might be time to reconsider science education's function as a 'host' for environmental education and try to imagine a more mutualistic relationship.

AB This paper examines the current and prospective status of education, employment, and sustainable development in the European Union (EU). Due to the decrease of the birth rate and the increase of life expectation, the size of the labor force is decreasing and its average age is increasing. Moreover rapid technological evolution will necessitate "long-life learning "for the old workers and young people. It will be a challenge to supply the EUs labor market with an adequate number of workers with the appropriate skill ad tempus. This will change profoundly the classical education system that will become the largest economic sector in the next decade.

TI Market-orientated positioning of on-farm processed foods as a condition
   for successful farm diversification
SO JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
LA English
DT Article
ID MEAT SAFETY; QUALITY; ENGLAND; BEEF; CHALLENGES; WELFARE
AB Farm diversification is stimulated within the reform of the common agricultural policy. On-farm processing and direct marketing are options, but farmers often lack a market-oriented approach. This paper illustrates the problem by presenting a consumer survey regarding on-farm processed yoghurt. Conjoint analysis is used to define the most preferred yoghurt in different market segments. Results of the price sensitivity meter are similar to the conjoint analysis. Farmers' price setting is not always adequate, which means that opportunities and additional income are lost. Providing the necessary assistance in collecting market information and commercial training is essential in obtaining sustainable benefits from on-farm processing and direct marketing.

   management on a surgical ward
SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NURSING
LA English
DT Article
DE continuous improvement; education; nurses; pain assessment; pain
ID NURSES; EDUCATION; OUTCOMES; CARE
AB Despite advances in pain control many patients experience moderate to severe pain whilst in hospital. Contributory factors include inadequate assessment and documentation of pain, as well as patient and professional misconceptions.
   A 28-bedded surgical ward in a District General Hospital in the South of England was the setting for the project. A small preliminary audit of pain on this ward indicated that some patients experienced postoperative pain, which was not effectively controlled. A 'continuous improvement' framework was used to increase understanding of the problem and identify an aim for the project, which was to reduce the number of patients refusing analgesics when offered by nurses.
   An audit to ascertain how many patients refused analgesia revealed that, of 133 patients offered, 93 (70%) refused. Using the 'Model for Improvement' (Langley et al., 1996) a number of changes were introduced, including a patient information sheet, regular documented pain assessment and an innovative staff education programme. To evaluate if the changes in practice had been successful, further audit data were collected from 167 patients. Sixty-three (44%) accepted analgesics, indicating a significant decrease in the number refusing (P = 0.005).
   This small project demonstrated that continuous improvement methodology can improve the management of pain and quality of care for patients. Such an approach brings practitioner and patient into meaningful understanding and offers solutions which are realistic, achievable and sustainable over time. Despite finite resources and increased pressure on staff it is possible to motivate people when they feel they have ownership and change is meaningful.
   Continuous improvement methods offer an exciting, feasible, patient-centred approach to improving care.

AB Improper agricultural activities seriously affect water quality. It is very important to control agricultural nonpoint source pollution along the Chi-Jia-Wang Stream to protect the habitat of land-locked salmon (Oncorhynchus masou formosanus), one of the endangered species in Taiwan. Riparian vegetative buffer strips are used to intercept wastewater, surface runoff and groundwater flow to reduce pesticide, nutrient and other organic pollutants before they enter the stream. This study estimates the suitable width for vegetated buffer strips in the riparian zone along the stream using a geographic information system and an index model. The groundwater in the study area is easily contaminated by pollutants due to the high hydraulic conductivity in the riparian zone of the Chi-Jia-Wang Stream. After comparing simulations on selected 46 kinds of selected pesticides, the maximum safety depth of Fenarimol was estimated. A wider Fenarimol vegetated strip is needed as a buffer zone to ensure pollution control effectiveness. Simulation results can provide a preliminary evaluation for the soil or groundwater pollution caused by pesticides, but the actual influences require onsite data verification.

TI Emergy evaluation perspectives of a multipurpose dam proposal in Korea
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE emergy; multipurpose dam; benefit; cost
ID SUSTAINABILITY
AB The 'emergy' concept was used to evaluate the economy of Korea and the contributions of a multipurpose dam proposal to the real wealth of the Korean economy. Emergy is defined as the available emergy of one kind previously used up directly and indirectly to make a product or service. The indices for Korea calculated from the emergy evaluation were close to those of developed countries. Even though its monetary balance of payments was negative in 1997, the economy of Korea showed positive balance in trade when exports and imports were expressed in emergy. The emergy evaluation showed that the Korean economy places a large stress on its environment. Water supply and generation of electricity were the most important contributions of the proposed dam in terms of emergy, 46(.)5 and 45(.)1% of the, total benefit, respectively. Flood control contributed 8(.)4% of the total benefit. Major costs associated with the proposed dam were from sediments (33(.)2% of the total cost), construction services (22(.)8%), and social disruption of the region (21(.)6%). In terms of emergy, the ratio of benefits to costs of the proposed dam was 2(.)78 if sediments are not included, and 1(.)86 if sediments are included, which result in more benefits than costs in both cases. The benefit to cost ratio of the dam was larger than that of the current system (1(.)42) without the dam whether sediments are included in the total cost or not. The environmental stress of the proposed dam was considerably lower than that of the Korean economy, but them dam might increase stress on local environment.

AB The success of conserving biological resources in any Biosphere Reserve or protected area depends on the extent of support and positive attitudes and perceptions of local people have towards such establishments. Ignoring the dependence of the local people for their subsistence needs on resources of such areas leads to conflicts between protected area managers and the local inhabitants. Crop yield losses and livestock depredation were serious problems observed in most buffer zone villages of Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve. In the present study 10 villages situated in the buffer zone of Nanada Devi Biosphere Reserve (1612 km(2) area) in Chamoli district of Uttaranchal, India were studied during 1996-97 using a questionnaire survey of each household (419 = households; 2253 = total population in 199 1; 273 ha = cultivated area). Estimates of crop yield losses were made using paired plots technique in four representative villages for each crop species. The magnitude of crop yield losses varied significantly with the distance of agricultural field from forest boundary. The total crop yield losses were high for wheat and potato in all the villages. The spatial distribution of total crop yield losses in any village indicated that they were highest in the area near to forest and least in the area near to village for all crops. Losses from areas near to forest contributed to more than 50% of total losses for each crop in all villages. However, in Lata, Peng and Tolma villages, the losses are high for kidney bean and chemmi (local variety of kidney bean) which varied between 18(.)5% to 30% of total losses in those villages. Potato alone represents 43(.)6% of total crop yield loss due to wildlife in Dronagiri village in monetary terms. Among the crops, the monetary value of yield losses are least for amaranth and highest for kidney bean. The projected total value of crop yield losses due to wildlife damage for buffer zone villages located in Garhwal Himalaya is about Rs. 5 38 620 (US$ 15389). Besides food grains, horticultural crops i.e. apple, also suffered maximum damage. Major wildlife agents responsible for crop damage were wild boar, bear, porcupine, monkey, musk deer and partridge (chokor). Monkey and wild boar alone accounted for about 50% to 60% of total crop damage in the study villages. Goat and sheep are the major livestock killed by leopard. The total value of livestock losses at prevailing market rates is about Rs. 1024520 (US$ 29272) in the study villages. Due to existing conservation policies and laxity in implementation of preventive measures, the problems for local inhabitants are increasing. Potential solutions discussed emphasize the need to undertake suitable and appropriate protective measures to minimize the crop losses. Change in cropping and crop composition, particularly cultivation of medicinal plants (high value low volume crops), were also suggested. Besides, fair and quick disbursement of compensation for crop loss and livestock killing need to be adopted. Local people of the buffer zone area already have a negative attitude towards park/reserve establishment due to socio-political changes inducing major economic losses and this attitude may lead to clashes and confrontations if proper ameliorative measures are not taken immediately.

   FARMS
AB Soil depletion and degradation have been increasingly recognized as important environmental issues in many parts of the world. Over the last decade a number of political and legislative measures have been introduced to encourage and enforce sustainable soil management in New Zealand. Application of the new legislation has highlighted gaps in our knowledge of soil quality and a lack of scientific methods to assess and monitor soil quality. This paper describes the legislative measures and outlines the scientific response to the needs of regulatory agencies responsible for maintaining environmental quality. The research recommended a set of indicators to assess soil quality. Each soil quality attribute has an associated "target range" defining the acceptable value for the attribute. The paper also discusses the communication of results to end-users, including the development of a computerized assessment tool. The legislative measures and scientific response have fostered a closer relationship between the policy and science communities, leading to more well-focused research, but greater collaboration is still required.

AB New Zealand is a signatory to international conventions on environmental performance, and soil quality information is needed for reporting both at a national and regional level. Soil quality was measured at 222 sites in rive regions of New Zealand (12 soil orders and 9 land-use categories). Topsoil (0-100 mm) properties measured were total carbon and nitrogen, potentially mineralizable N, pH, Olsen P, cation exchange capacity, bulk density, total porosity, macroporosity, and total available and readily available water. Our objectives were to gauge the representativeness of the sample, determine the contribution from land use or soil order to variability, rationalize the data set, and identify concerns for long-term sustainable land use. Soil and land use combinations were both under- or overrepresented in the data set compared with national distribution. Soil order and land-use categories explained 55 to 76% of the variance in soil properties. Total C contents of pastures were comparable with indigenous forest soils, but pastures were less acidic and with higher N and P contents. Plantation forests had characteristics similar to indigenous forests on comparable soils. Cropland soils comprised < 1 % of the national land cover and generally had high inorganic fertility and low organic matter, with evidence of compaction. Seven characteristics (total C, total N, mineralizable N, pH, Olsen P, bulk density, and macroporosity) explained 87% of the total variability. The findings are being used by monitoring agencies to raise awareness about soil quality in the wider community, set land management guidelines, and develop policies.

AB We tested the hypotheses that the relationship between heart rate (fH) and the rate of oxygen consumption (<(V)over dot>(O2)) differs between walking and flying in geese and that fH and <(V)over dot>(O2), have a U-shaped relationship with flight speed. We trained barnacle geese Branta leucopsis (mean mass 2.1 kg) and bar-headed geese Anser indicus (mean mass 2.6 kg) to walk inside a respirometer on a treadmill and to fly in a wind tunnel with a respirometry mask at a range of speeds. We measured fH and <(V)over dot>(O2), simultaneously during walking on the treadmill in five individuals of each species and in one bar-headed goose and four barnacle geese during flight in the wind tunnel. The relationships between fH and <(V)over dot>(O2) were significantly different between flying and walking. <(V)over dot>(O2) was higher, and the increment in <(V)over dot>(O2), for a given increase in fH was greater, for flying than for walking geese. The relationship between fH and <(V)over dot>(O2), of free-living barnacle geese during their natural migratory flights must differ from that measured in the wind tunnel, since the fH of wild migratory birds corresponds to values of <(V)over dot>(O2), that are unrealistically low when using the calibration relationship for our captive birds. Neither fH nor <(V)over dot>(O2) varied with flight velocity across the range of speeds over which the geese would fly sustainably.

AB Annual dry-matter production was estimated from eight year old apple trees of 'Fuji', 'Braeburn' and 'Royal Gala' on rootstock M.9, trained as slender spindles, in a spacing trial with trees spaced at 1.3, 1.5, 1.9 and 2.4 m within the row with tree rows 3.5 m apart. Light interception was recorded at intervals during the season. Both fresh weight yield and total dry-matter production were linear functions of light interception, with a higher slope recorded for the two late season cultivars compared with the early maturing 'Royal Gala'. Comparison of the relationship between mid-season light interception and apple yields with published values from elsewhere, reveals that the slope of the relationship is enhanced under New Zealand conditions. The relationship suggests an upper limit of yield of 169 t ha(-1) at 90% light interception, slightly higher than the maximum yield recorded of 163 t ha(-1). Energy conversion of intercepted light over the growing season into dry-matter production was similar to that observed in the United Kingdom, suggesting that the major climatic advantage in New Zealand over the United Kingdom is the higher growing season radiation integral. Dry matter was allocated in the order fruit>woody tissue>leaves, with partitioning to the fruit of 74, 72 and 63% for 'Braeburn', 'Fuji' and 'Royal Gala', respectively. Under New Zealand conditions, sustainable 70% harvest index values may be achievable for mature apple trees on dwarfing rootstock with late maturing cultivars.

AB Over the past decade. concern about the morphological and ecological condition of the rivers Rhine and Meuse has increased. Simultaneously with the projects for rehabilitation. measures were proposed to improve the discharge capacity of the high-water floodway, in order to reduce the risk of river flooding. Although many studies focus on the impact of different landscaping measures on the river hydrodynamics (water level and discharge capacity), little attention is paid to the sustainability of the proposed measures with respect to sedimentation. In this study a one-dimensional (1D) floodplain sedimentation model was developed that estimates average sediment accumulation over floodplain sections and that can be used for estimation of changes in floodplain sedimentation caused by landscaping measures. The model was successfully calibrated and validated using sedimentation measurements carried out at different floodplain sections along the river Rhine in The Netherlands during floods. Application of the model to the main branches of the river Rhine in The Netherlands indicates that the average annual sediment accumulation equals 1,72 kg/m(2)/yr, or 394 million kg/yr. This is about 13% of the total annual suspended sediment load transported into The Netherlands at Lobith. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

ID METHODOLOGY; DESIGN
AB Unplanned and unsustainable development (particularly rapid industrialisation) has placed great pressure in every dimension of the environment (air, water, soil, health, etc.). The resulting disturbance in the natural ecological balance is a serious concern. Sustainable development is the need of the hour; it can only be achieved through effective environmental management. Environmental management will become indispensable in the future as regulatory restrictions tighten and public expectations of environmental performance increase. The day is not far away when a customer will prefer to buy products produced by an environmentally committed organisation. In short, the environmental commitment of an organisation will become a market strategy.
   Environmental management is a set of actions based on a structured methodology to ensure that an organisation is committed to the environment and that the production process has minimal/no adverse affect on it. This article emphasises environmental management in the real engineering sense of the term, and discusses how to develop an effective environmental management system through life cycle assessment. It further demonstrates through a real life case study how an industry has achieved landmark success in managing its environment, production, as well as winning the good faith of society.

AB This paper attempts to predict where the future challenges lie for MOVPE from an industrial perspective. These key challenges include the need to provide ever-increasing capacity and ever-reducing costs, the need to cope with increasing complexity and the tightening of tolerances, the need for device-level qualification, the shortening of product development cycles and the need to address environmental sustainability and recycling issues. The paper identifies two themes that the author believes are crucial to the resolution of these key challenges. The themes are those of "modeling and simulation" and "monitoring and control".

AB Objective: To examine psychosocial and demographic variables associated with consumer intention to purchase sustainably produced foods using an expanded Theory of Planned Behavior.
   Design: Consumers were approached at the store entrance and asked to complete a self-administered survey.
   Setting: Three metropolitan Minnesota grocery stores
   Participants: Participants (n = 550) were adults who shopped at the store: the majority were white, female, and highly educated and earned greater than or equal to$50,000/year. Participation rates averaged 62%.
   Main Outcome Measures: The major domain investigated was consumer support for sustainably produced foods. Demographics, beliefs, attitudes, subjective norm, and self-identity and perceived behavioral control were evaluated as predictors of intention to purchase them.
   Analysis: Descriptive statistics, independent t tests, one-way analysis of variance, Pearson product moment correlation coefficients, and stepwise multiple regression analyses (P < .05).
   Results: Consumers were supportive of sustainably produced foods but not highly confident in their ability to purchase them. Independent predictors of intention to purchase them included attitudes, beliefs, perceived behavioral control, subjective norm, past buying behavior, and marital status.
   Conclusions and Implications: Beliefs, attitudes, and confidence level may influence intention to purchase sustainably produced foods. Nutrition educators could increase consumers' awareness of sustainably produced foods by understanding their beliefs, attitudes, and confidence levels.

TI Seven percent growth for Mexico? A quantitative assessment of Mexico's

DE potential GDP; investment requirements; economic growth; Mexico
AB Mexico's president Vicente Fox made a promise during his campaign that before he leaves office in 2006, the economy would be growing at an annual 7% rate, up from the 3.1% compound annual rate of growth that Mexico has reported since 1990. Using three different approaches (production function, trend capital-output ratio, and Hodrick-Prescott time-series filter), we conclude that Mexico already faced an excess demand. With existing capital stock and productivity, Mexico cannot sustain a 7% growth rate. Thus, Fox needs to expand Mexico's supply capacity significantly through a high rate of investment to attain a sustainable 7% growth path. (C) 2002 Society for Policy Modeling.

AB There is little information on the impact of grazing intensity on productivity and sustainability of intensively managed pastures in the humid, short-season parkland of the Canadian prairies. Our hypothesis was that above-ground productivity of dry matter, carbon, nitrogen, and in vitro digestible organic matter would be reduced proportionately with increasing grazing intensity. The study was conducted on a Typic Haplustoll at Lacombe, Alberta. Paddocks of-meadow bromegrass (Bromus riparius Rhein.), replicated 4 times, were subjected to heavy, medium and light grazing intensities. Measurements and analyses were carried out for 3 years. Yields of dry matter, carbon, nitrogen, and in vitro digestible organic matter before and after grazing were determined and seasonal pools of above ground production, disappearance and residual were calculated. Concentrations of acid and neutral detergent fiber and lignin were also determined before and after grazing. Increasing grazing intensity tended to increase nitrogen and decrease fiber concentrations for available and residual forage. Heavy and medium grazing intensities produced 83 and 90% as much above ground dry matter and 87 and 90% above ground carbon as the light intensity. All disappearance pools were similar among grazing intensities except in vitro digestible organic matter, where heavy was 116% of light. Heavy grazing reduced the contribution of vegetative dry matter, in vitro digestible organic matter, carbon and nitrogen to the residual to 41, 50, 36, and 52% of that for light grazing. Adding estimated fecal-carbon to the residual significantly increased total residual carbon. Estimated fecal-carbon represented 68, 51, and 42% of all carbon inputs to litter for heavy, medium and light grazing, respectively. Grazing intensity did not affect estimated pools of excreted nitrogen, but increased estimated percent of nitrogen excreted as urine.

TI Stocking rate and cow-calf production on sand sagebrush rangeland
SO JOURNAL OF RANGE MANAGEMENT

   optimum stocking rate
ID TEXAS
AB Stocking rate is generally considered to be the most important management factor in sustainable grazing of Great Plains grasslands over management periods of 10 to 20 years or longer. Most studies to determine optimum stocking rates have compared only 2 or 3 discrete stocking rates. Our objective was to determine cow, calf, and economic performance on sand sagebrush (Artemisia filifolia Torr.) rangeland as a continuous function of stocking rate. Replicated stocking rates of 0.11, 0.15, and 0.22 head ha(-1) were studied over an 8-year period. Cow weight declined as stocking rate increased in drought years but was not affected by stocking rate in wetter years. Weaning percentage was not affected by stocking rate but variation within treatment groups was high. Calf birth weight and weaning weight both declined as stocking rate increased. Comparing 0.11 and 0.22 head ha(-1), calf production cow(-1) declined from 206 to 144 kg cow(-1) as stocking rate increased but calf production ha(-1) increased from 22.6 to 31.7 kg calf ha(-1). Net returns were maximized at $7.87 ha(-1) year(-1) at a stocking rate of 0.172 head ha(-1), well within the range of experimental treatments. Net returns were within 5% of maximum between stocking rates of 0.156 and 0.183 head ha(-1). The variability of all responses increased as stocking rate increased. Simulation indicated-that improved livestock prices and increased animal productivity shifted the economic optimum stocking rate to higher levels, which would put more pressure on the conservation ethic of land managers.

AB Growth, mortality and productivity of the hard clam Eurhomalea exalbida from Ushuaia Bay, Beagle Channel, were investigated. The parameters of the von Bertalanffy growth function were estimated to be H-infinity_ = 74 mm, K = 0.18 y(-1), t(0) = 0.15 y. Maximum individual production amounted to 2.74 g shell-free wet mass (SFWM) at 49.5 mm shell height. Animals between 40 mm and 70 nun shell height contributed most to overall population somatic production P of 134 g SFWM m(-2) y(-1). Mean annual biomass B amounted to 1123 g SFWM m(-2) y(-1). Annual P/B ratio and mortality rate Z were estimated to be 0.12 y(-1) and 0.14 y(-1), respectively. Slow growth and low turnover make this population less suitable for sustainable commercial exploitation. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Soil erosion and off-site transport of nutrients are reducing soil productivity and impacting water bodies across the world. Additionally, anthropogenic activities are increasing the atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and nitric oxide (NO) that contribute to global warming. We want to present the concept that nutrient management plans should incorporate soil organic carbon (SOC) management to reduce soil erosion, cycle macro- and micronutrients, increase nutrient use efficiency, and conserve air, soil, and water quality. Plant-derived materials are the primary source of carbon (C) in soil organic matter (SOM), with C being the most abundant constituent and common partner of nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P), and sulfur (S). Manures, compost, and other organic sources can help cycle organic C and other nutrients. Organic C can contribute to forming chelate compounds that increase the availability of essential micronutrients that interchange with the root surface. Management practices that increase C inputs, help reduce erosion, and increase SOC improve soil quality factors such as cation exchange capacity, water holding capacity, aggregate formation, porosity, and drainage. Carbon management and nutrient cycling should be an integral part of nutrient management plans for maintaining the sustainability of our biosphere.

AB In the UK, the disposal of wastes from the production of potable water has been an increasing problem for water companies since the introduction of the Waste Management Licensing Regulations in 1994. This paper considers alternative management strategies. The importance of investigating each works individually is stressed because of variations in sludge properties and disposal costs. Of the disposal options, the growing of turf is environmentally sustainable and economically attractive, whereas direct spreading on agricultural land and use in soil production can be successful. Other uses, e.g. in ceramics, are at various stages of development; co-disposal with sewage is an option, but hidden costs need to be assessed.

AB Land degradation cannot be judged independently of its spatial. temporal, economic, environmental and cultural context. Evaluations are therefore almost infinitely variable and very dynamic. These observations are examined in two contexts, first in two case studies. One, from the southern Levant, makes use of a long and well-documented history of environmental assessment that varied greatly between communities. The other, from contemporary Niger, shows finer scale differences among villagers. Second, the dynamic and Multiple assessment of futures (sustainability) is illustrated With data from the same case study in Niger. In this wider context, multiplicity and dynamicity are largely a consequence of the choice of model of the environmental or social future. The usually positive difference between large-scale and finer scale assessments of degradation is dubbed the 'social delivery ratio'. Simplified systems of evaluation may be necessary for allocation, but they need to be treated With great caution if the argument here is accepted. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB Amidst growing concerns about farmlands conservation, this paper examines the status of farmlands in two mountain watersheds 'with' and 'without' external intervention, located in the western hills of Nepal. Information was obtained from a household survey and group discussions conducted during April to September 1999, The severity of soil erosion from farmers' perspectives, density of landslides, soil nutrient balance and change in crop yield have been adopted as indicators of the status of the land. Results of the analysis indicate that land resources in both watersheds are undergoing degradation, though the causes and extent of degradation vary from one type of land to another. Upland crop terraces. locally called bari, are undergoing degradation most seriously under the combined influence of severe soil erosion, landslide and the depletion of soil nutrients. In particular, soil erosion has severely affected nearly half of the upland crop terraces in both watersheds due to a number of natural and anthropogenic factors ranging from weak geological structure to arable agriculture. Landslide and nutrient depletion have affected all types of farmlands except homesteads in both watersheds. Overall, the extent and intensity of land degradation is relatively high in the non-project area, as farmers were not provided with necessary technical and financial support, A broad strategy has been outlined for effective conservation of farmlands.

AB In 1998 a management system based on individual transferable quota (ITQ) was introduced in the Tasmanian rock lobster fishery. This marked the continuation of a management trend that has favoured economic efficiency at the cost of reduced employment and greater restrictions on access to the fishery. The authors discuss management trends in the fishery in the context of Tasmania's history, and social and political characteristics, which it is argued, have shaped development of Tasmania's resource management culture. Implications for social equality, economic well-being and environmental sustainability are discussed. In conclusion the difficulty of reforming policy that has been shaped by vested interests and which establishes rent-seeking activity is considered.

AB In natural environments, microorganisms are exposed to a wide variety of antibiotic compounds produced by competing organisms. Target organisms have evolved various mechanisms of natural resistance to these metabolites. In this study, the role of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters in interactions between the plant-pathogenic fungus Botrytis cinerea and antibiotic-producing Pseudomonas bacteria was investigated in detail. We discovered that 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol, phenazine-l-carboxylic acid and phenazine-l-carboxamide (PCN), broad-spectrum antibiotics produced by Pseudomonas spp., induced expression of several ABC transporter genes in B. cinerea. Phenazines strongly induced expression of BcatrB, and DeltaBcatrB mutants were significantly more sensitive to these antibiotics than their parental strain. Treatment of B. cinerea germlings with PCN strongly affected the accumulation of [C-14]fludioxonil, a phenylpyrrole fungicide known to be transported by BcatrB, indicating that phenazines also are transported by BcatrB. Pseudomonas strains producing phenazines displayed a stronger antagonistic activity in vitro toward DeltaBcatrB mutants than to the parental B. cinerea strain. On tomato leaves, phenazine-producing Pseudomonas strains were significantly more effective in reducing gray mold symptoms incited by a DeltaBcatrB mutant than by the parental strain. We conclude that the ABC transporter BcatrB provides protection to B. cinerea in phenazine-mediated interactions with Pseudomonas spp. Collectively, these results indicate that fungal ABC transporters can play an important role in antibiotic-mediated interactions between bacteria and fungi in plant-associated environments. The implications of these findings for the implementation and sustainability of crop protection by antagonistic microorganisms are discussed.

TI Human dimensions of conservation in the Kangchendzonga Biosphere
   Reserve: The need for conflict prevention
SO MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB The Khangchendzonga Biosphere Reserve (KBR) is one of the latest additions to the protected areas network in the Indian Himalayan Region. Located in the picturesque state of Sikkim in the eastern Indian Himalayan Region with snow-clad mountain peaks, numerous glaciers, a snow- and glacier-fed stream network and high-altitude lakes, this biosphere reserve (BR) is named after the world's third highest mountain peak, Mt Khangchendzonga (8598 m), I of the 14 peaks in the world above 8000 m. The KBR covers an area of 2619.92 km(2), 36.92% of the land area of Sikkim (Figure 1). BRs exemplify participatory sustainable resource use and ecosystem conservation. It is therefore important to consider the human dimensions of a BR from the outset and to survey stakeholders' attitudes about conservation in order to Ilk e into account the inherent traditional dependence of people on forest-based resources. Potential future conflicts of interest need to be addressed through well-thought out strategies and integration of traditional conflict prevention mechanisms. Experience gained in the KBR may be useful in light of the widely reported conflicts in other BRs and protected areas around the world. Careful and informed planning may help reduce the likelihood of conflicts arising in newly established BRs.

ID TROPICAL DECIDUOUS FOREST; GAP SIZE; VEGETATION; MEXICO
AB A critical component of sustainable forest management is the regeneration of commercially valuable tree species. Mechanical cleaning with machetes and chainsaws, prescribed burning, and a combination of both treatments were applied to recently-created logging gaps in a Bolivian dry forest to evaluate their impact on the natural regeneration of commercial tree species and on control of competing vegetation. The three treatments and an untreated control were applied to logging gaps during the dry season of 1998 and replicated ten times. Eight months following burning, the density of commercial tree regeneration in gaps did not differ statistically among treatments. Relative height growth of total commercial regeneration also did not differ among treatments, although it did vary by species. Reduction in competing vegetation following the application of site preparation treatments was significantly higher, but competing plant cover was beginning to converge among treatments after eight months. Despite better control of competing vegetation, early recruitment and growth responses to burning and cleaning of vegetation in logging gaps do not appear to justify application of these treatments in this forest, especially considering their high costs.

TI Fisheries management by spawning per recruit analysis for Pagrus major
   around the coastal waters of Ishima Island, Tokushima Prefecture

DT Article
AB Fisheries management of Pagrus major around Ishima Island on the Pacific coast of Tokushima Prefecture was examined based on spawning per recruit (SPR) analysis. % SPR of the present stock is 11.97% and the lower limit status for a sustainable yield is 20%. A SPR of 20% can be attained by reducing mainly the fishing coefficient by 20% on small trawls which raise the fishing pressure around Ishima Island and by more than 60% on fish younger than one year old by fixing the minimum size limit to a total length of 14 cm. The ideal status (% SPR = 30%) can be attained by reducing the fishing coefficient by 20% on small trawls and by 60% on fish younger than one year old, and 40% on one year old fish by fixing the minimum size limit to a fork length of 20 cm. The fish younger than one year old are caught by small trawl fishery, and one year old fish by pole line and set net fishery. Stock management can be attained by reducing the fishing coefficient of small trawls and releasing the fish caught under the minimum size limit.

AB It has been shown that with careful grazing management and addition of P and K, but not N, fertilisers Brachiaria pastures are able to maintain sustainable live weight gains over many years. However, standard on-farm practice, which generally involves high stocking rates, leads after a few years to pasture decline due mainly to N deficiency for grass regrowth. To generate an understanding of the mechanism of pasture decline and possible management options to mitigate this process, a study was performed in the Atlantic forest region of the south of Bahia state to study the N dynamics in pastures of Brachiaria humidicola subject to three different stocking rates of beef cattle, with and without the presence of the forage legume Desmodium ovalifolium. Despite the fact that the C:N ratio of the deposited litter was high (60 to 70) the rate of decomposition was very rapid (k similar to -0.07 g g(-1) day(-1)) and annual rates of N turnover through the litter pathway were between 105 and 170 kg N ha(-1) year(-1). In the grass-only pastures as stocking rate increased from 2 to 3 head ha(-1), N recycled in the litter decreased by 11%, but a further increase to 4 head ha(-1) decreased N recycling by 30% suggesting that beyond a certain critical level higher grazing stocking rates would lead to pasture decline if there was no N addition. High stocking rates decreased the proportion of the legume in the sward, but at all rates the concentration of N in both the green and dead grass in the forage on offer and in the litter was higher in the mixed sward. The presence of the legume caused a decrease in the C:N ratio of the microbial biomass while both soil N mineralisation and nitrification increased. This increased rate of turnover of the microbial biomass and the contribution of N-2 fixation to the legume resulted in large increases in the N recycled via litter deposition ranging from 42 to 155 kg N ha(-1) year(-1).

AB Few empirical studies have been conducted on the state of science in Africa. Based on the results of a study sponsored by the European Commission, the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MAE) and the institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD), this paper attempts to provide a realistic picture of the science profession in Africa today. Scientific and technical (S&T) activities went through a process of institutionalisation and professionalisation in Africa during the lost thirty years. But these efforts have not been sufficient to create a sustainable dynamic process of scientific production and of reproduction of the national scientific communities. The situation is today critical in a number of countries and particularly in Median Africa (Sub-Saharan Africa excluding South Africa) where S&T systems and the working environment of scientists are deteriorating. The results of the empirical studies presented in this article not only provide a vivid picture of the conditions of the science profession on the African continent, but also contribute to diagnosing the situation in terms of political urgency.

AB Nutrient sufficiency is the basis of good health, productive lives and longevity for everyone. Nutrient availability to people is primarily determined by the output of foods produced from agricultural systems. If agricultural systems fail to provide enough food diversity and quantity to satisfy all the nutrients essential to human life, people will suffer, societies will deteriorate and national development efforts will stagnate. Importantly, plant foods provide most of the nutrients that feed the developing world. Unfortunately, as a result of population pressures, many global food systems are not currently providing enough micronutrients to assure adequate micronutrient intakes for all people. This has resulted in an increasing prevalence of micronutrient deficiencies (e.g., iron deficiency, vitamin A deficiency, and iodine deficiency disorders) that now afflicts over three billion people globally mostly among resource-poor women, infants and children in developing countries. The consequences of micronutrient malnutrition are profound and alarming for human existence. Agricultural approaches to finding sustainable solutions to this problem are urgently needed. This review presents some ways in which plant nutritionists can contribute to preventing micronutrient malnutrition in sustainable ways.

AB Precision agriculture was initiated in the mid 1980s, using newly available technologies, to improve the application of fertilizers by varying rates and blends as needed within fields. Presently, the concept has been adapted to a variety of practices, crops, and countries. Its adoption varies significantly by cropping system, regions, and countries but it is progressively introduced or evaluated around the world. Several types of challenges limit a broader adoption: socio-economical, agronomical, and technological. Socio-economical barriers are principally costs and lack of skills. Agronomical challenges are lack of basic information, inadequate sampling and scouting procedures, absence of site-specific fertilizer recommendations, misuse of information, and lack of qualified agronomic services. There are multiple technological barriers that relate to machinery, sensor, GPS, software, and remote sensing. However, these barriers will be progressively lifted and precision agriculture will be a significant component of the agricultural system of the future.

SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF CIVIL ENGINEERS-TRANSPORT
LA English
DT Article
DE economics & finance; environment; transport planning
AB Moving people and freight in an environmentally sustainable manner will be one of the biggest challenges of the 21(st) century. A new, target-oriented approach is needed that places environment and health at the top of the policy agenda for transport and related sectors, at international, national, and local levels. The OECD recently completed a five-year initiative with the development of Guidelines for Environmentally Sustainable Transport (EST) and concluded that there exists a new way towards a sustainable transport future. Unlike conventional approaches to transport policy, EST uses a backcasting approach. This involves defining what is meant by environmentally sustainable transport, developing a vision, and then working out how to realise it. It also implies an assessment of the economic and social implications of EST. Environmentally sustainable transport doesn't mean less transport than we have today, but it certainly means different transport using technological advances and 'smarter' transport through innovative mobility management, integrated mobility services and freight logistics. This paper summarises the main results of the project based on the case studies from twelve OECD countries. It also includes a series of Guidelines for policy-making endorsed by OECD Environment Ministers in 2001. The EST Guidelines have been elaborated to assist governments at all levels in the development and implementation of strategies towards EST. Their effective implementation requires strategies that accommodate the particular geographic and socioeconomic conditions of countries or regions and involve all parties concerned.

DE recycling of materials; roads & highways; waste management & disposal
AB Key factors in the Government's agenda for sustainable construction are to increase the amount of recycling and use of alternative materials. In practice, a number of issues can limit the extent of these activities. If the objectives of sustainable construction are to be realised, these issues must be positively addressed. This paper looks at recycling in the renewal of transport infrastructure, defined as the earthworks, drainage and pavements for roads, railways, airports and canals, but many of the issues are also relevant to other sectors of construction. Issues perceived as obstacles to recycling include lack of specifications, concerns about reliability and quality control, the application of the waste management regulations, potential pollution of the environment, increased risk, adversarial conditions of contract, balancing supply and demand, planning restrictions and the economics of recycling. In many cases these obstacles are more apparent than real, and perhaps the greatest problem is lack of awareness. Guidance and a number of case studies are presented in a document produced by TRL Limited, entitled Recycling in transport infrastructure. Further action is required to resolve some issues, in particular those connected with the waste management regulations, and these are discussed in the paper. Solutions are proposed, including the establishment of a National Industrial Forum to resolve issues involving the environmental protection agencies, industry, infrastructure owners and operators, and government.

DE food policy; agriculture; diet; sustainability
ID MORTALITY
AB Food policies deliver large quantities of food relatively safely, but they are failing to deliver healthy diets. Policies fall into three broad categories: the supply of sufficient amounts of food (food security); the provision of food free from contamination (food safety); the provision of a healthy diet available to all (nutritional quality). These three aspects are dealt with by institutions that rarely engage with each other, let alone coordinate their strategies. Greater financial support has been given to agricultural policy than to any other joint EU endeavour. In the last decade food safety has dominated headlines and has influenced recent changes to EU food policies. New food authorities and agencies have been established and ministerial responsibilities have been redefined. Yet, it is nutrition, or rather 'mis-nutrition', that is the largest single cause of death and disease within the region, and indeed worldwide. This need not be the case. Nutrition and dietary policies may find themselves in close alliance with policies for sustainable agriculture. However, the change in thinking that will be required will mean reconsidering the role of commercial food production. Successful nutrition policies may yet prove to be the next major step in the improvement of public health.

AB Overseeding temperate legumes is one of the most practices to increase the quantity, quality and sustainability of perennial pastures in Southern Brazil. During the years of 2000 and 2001 the response of six temperate legumes (Adesmia latifolia (wild), Lotus corniculatus, L. subbiflorus, L. uliginosus and Trifolium repens cv. Yi and cv. Regal) was evaluated in mixture with tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea). There was a period of 475 days between sowing date and the last cut and six cuts were made; on the autumn-winter/2000 only one cut was made, on the spring-summer, three cuts and on the autumn-winter/2001, two cuts. The intervals between cuts ranged between 43 and 91 days, being reduced in the warm season. During the total assay period, the average of the mixtures yielded 15038 kg/ha of DM; in the warm season 54% of this total was produced, with an average growth rate of 46 kg/ha/day of DM. In the cold season of 2000 and 2001 this rate was of 22 and 24 kg/ha/day of DM. The birdsfoot trefoil and white clover cv. Yi were the most productive legumes; the former was the best in the warm season (3500 kg/ha of DM) and the last participated with 86,3% in the mixture in the autumn-winter/2001, with 2300 kg/ha/day of DM. The mixtures containing these legumes presented the smallest quantity of weeds and produced 13663 and 11, 184 kg/ha of DM respectively, being 82% and 71% of these totals composed of legumes, fescue and ryegrass. A. latifolia did not have a good establishment and its contribution was only 0,84% in the first cut. The L. subbiflorus had a good establishment on the first year, but it disappeared from the mixture in the second year. L. uliginosus had a good establishment and persistence producing up to 1400 kg/ha of DM in the autumn/2001.

AB The History of Industry mirrors the History of Society, by which it is also reflected. Its purpose is to describe the emergence of technologies which exhibit a personality of their own and not only bring out new possibilities, but also a stiffness to which all stakeholders should to some extend yield, especially the decision makers in business circles. Technologies that succeed commercially are those which are able to provide sustainable answers to the demands put forward successively by each one of them. These robust technologies, which are not identical to the disruptive technologies of K. Brimacombe, meet criteria, which in effect are true innovation paradigms. A list of these is proposed here, stemming from a retrospective analysis of process development in the steel industry. It is probably adventurous to project these into a technological forecasting exercise, due to the non-deterministic nature of history. But this is an interesting way to focus on the challenges that should be met in the future and that no stakeholder would refuse to face.

AB ARCELOR has conducted a large program called "The Cycle of Iron" with steel users and steel scrap recyclers, in order to emphasize the sustainability of Steel recycling. The results of this work can already be applied to the Design for Recycling of goods that incorporate steel. Home appliances are made of materials that are easily recyclable, such as steel, aluminum or copper, and of others, which are not much recycled, such as plastics or foam. Because poorly recyclable materials have to be disposed of, their recycling value is negative. Ecodesign of appliances needs to tackle this issue. One simple solution is to include more metals in the design of new products.

DE Goulburn River; environmental flows; water allocation; water market
ID FLOW
AB In the Goulbum River, located in Victoria (Australia), dams and diversions for irrigation have modified streamflows and water temperature, and contributed to environmental degradation that includes declining native fish populations.
   With the passage of a new Water Act in 1989, the Victorian Government proposed to address environmental and water allocation issues through the development of tradeable water entitlements. Initially, these had a strong environmental focus and were to be allocated within an adaptive management framework that involved monitoring and evaluation to refine the total allowable diversion to sustainable levels. The actual specification of tradeable water entitlements for the Goulbum River, undertaken in 1995, differed substantially from those early proposals. Entitlements were largely based on historical use with limited and ineffective allocation of water to the environment because water temperature was not considered. A water market has been established but market failure is likely to result in an under-allocation of water to the environment. Access to the market is restricted except to irrigation authorities and water users, and transaction costs and uncertainties in environmental requirements reinforce the status quo in water allocation which is dominated by production values.

AB The state of mixed forests of maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Ait.) and broadleaved species in the coastal region of Galicia (north-western Spain) was described using data from 213 circular sample plots selected among the available 4700 plots of the Spanish National Inventory. A matrix model was developed for this forest type to obtain information about the productivity and potential for sustainable management. The broadleaved species had a diameter distribution close to the inverted J-shape typical of the uneven-aged forests but for maritime pine there were many medium-sized trees and a lack of trees in the first diameter class of 15 cm. The matrix growth model was used to predict the development of mixed forests for three different management options: no harvesting in a well-stocked stand, a regime with a 5 yr harvest cycle and a residual basal area of 15 m(2) ha(-1) in a well-stocked stand, and a rehabilitation management applied to an understocked stand. The results showed the possibility of applying uneven-aged silvicultural systems to these forests, leading to the production of high-value timber and to the maintenance of continuous cover and a biodiverse forest.

AB In many developing countries, private health practitioners provide a significant portion of curative care for diseases which are of public health importance. Currently, health sector reform efforts in these countries are fostering increased participation of private providers in the delivery of health services, including those of public health importance. Guaranteeing good technical quality of care is critical to the process. However, little is known about private providers' technical quality of care (disease management practices) and the factors influencing these services. The purpose of this study was to contribute information on this topic.
   The study was conducted among private providers in rural West Bengal, India and focused on providers' disease management practices for acute respiratory infections (ARI) among under-five children. World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for ARI case management were used as the expected standard of care. Observations of patient-provider encounters and interviews with the providers and mothers were the main sources of data.
   The study found that private health providers in rural West Bengal have inadequate technical quality of care. The problem was related both to low levels of performance (limited potential) and inconsistency in performance (within-provider variation). Limited potential for good technical quality for ARI among the providers was related to lack of knowledge (technical incompetence). One of the important factors influencing within-provider variation was patient load. Since rural private providers operate on a fee-for-service payment system, there are incentives related to seeing many patients. The study concluded that to bring about sustainable improvements in private providers' ARI disease management practices, training programs and interventions that improved compliance were necessary.

AB The potential of crop residue fertilization as a carbon sequestration technology was evaluated in a central Ohio Luvisol (fine, mixed, mesic Aeric Ochraqualf). Wheat (Triticum aestitium L.) straw was applied at three rates (bare: 0; low: 8 Mg; and high: 16 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1)) without (-F) and with (+F) addition of 244 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1). The treatments were triplicated in a completely randomized block design. We report on the impact of these treatments on the total stocks and biochemical attributes of soil organic C (SOC) in the 0 to 10-cm soil layer after 4 years. Microbial biomass C (MBC) and mineralizable C (MinC), as measures of the labile C pools, were used as biochemical indices. SOC stocks, MBC and MinC were generally lowest in the bare plots, and more so with fertilization of these treatment plots. The addition of wheat straw and fertilizer had a positive and interacting effect on SOC stocks. With low mulch application, SOC stocks were similar (25.6 Mg C ha(-1)) in the -F and +F plots. However, when the mulch rate was high, further SOC accretion (28.2 Mg ha(-1)) occurred only in the +F plots. Residue-C conversion into SOC averaged 14% and 32% without and with fertilization, respectively. Positive effects of wheat straw application on MBC and MinC(110) (days) were also found. Although not significant, MBC was generally lower in the fertilized compared with unfertilized treatments. Fertilization of wheat residue resulted in a 1.5-fold increase in MinC, and a 1.3 to 4 times increase in the metabolic quotient (unit of MinC per unit of MBC per day), suggesting alteration in the soil microbial community composition and less efficient C processing with fertilization. The temporal variation of these soil biochemical attributes and the fate of the labile C compounds that evolved with fertilization of residue will determine the long-term sustainability of residue fertilization practice on C sequestration in soils.

ID QUALITY CIRCLES
AB Although the use of continuous improvement (CI) is widespread today, many organizations are faced with problems associated with both the implementation and long-term sustainability of their CI programmes. The purpose of this article is to identify factors important for the sustainable development of suggestion schemes. A case study has been performed in a company that was chosen because the suggestion scheme has been in existence for nine years with a activity level. The main method used is semi-structured interviews and the study of the long-term development has been complemented with previous research performed at the case study company. There seem to have been three periods in the development of the suggestion scheme. First, a period when the system was introduced by a champion (Initiation). Secondly, a period of decline in interest (Decline). Finally, a period of new interest when the suggestion scheme attracted new attention from employees (New Interest). A number of factors seem to influence the sustainability of the suggestion scheme. (1) A champion initiated the suggestion scheme in 1993. (2) The system has been simple and easy to adjust to suit the interests of the stakeholders within the organization. Furthermore it was not too time consuming for anyone involved. (3) Commitment both from managers and shop-floor workers has been an important aspect of the sustainability of the system. (4) Also important was quick feedback to employees submitting suggestions.

AB An appropriate combination of tillage and nitrogen management practices will be necessary to develop sustainable farming practices. A six-year (1993-1998) field study was conducted on subsurface-drained Clyde-Kenyon-Floyd soils to quantify the impact of two tillage systems (chisel plow vs. no tillage) and two N fertilizer management practices (preplant single application vs. late-spring soil test based application) on nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) leaching loss with subsurface drain discharge from corn (Zea mays L.) soybean (Glycine max L.) rotation plots. Preplant injected urea ammonium nitrate solution (UAN) fertilizer was applied at the rate of 110 kg ha(-1) to chisel plow and no-till corn plots, while the late-spring N application rate averaged 179 and 156 kg ha(-1) for the no-till and chisel plow corn plots, respectively. Data on subsurface drainage flow volume, NO3-N concentrations in subsurface drainage water, NO3-N loss with subsurface drainage flow, and crop yield were collected and analyzed using a randomized complete block design. Differences in subsurface drainage flow volume due to annual variations in rainfall significantly (P = 0.05) affected the NO3-N loss with subsurface drainage flows. High correlation (R-2 = 0. 89) between annual subsurface drainage flow volume and the annual NO3-N leaching loss with subsurface drainage water was observed. The flow-weighted average annual NO3-N concentrations varied from a low of 6.8 mg L-1 in 1994 to a high of 13.9 mg L-1 in 1996. Results of this study indicated that NO3-N losses from the chisel plow plots were 16% (16 vs. 19 kg-N ha(-1)) lower in comparison with no-till plots, while corn grain yield was 11% higher in the chisel plow plots (8.3 vs. 7.5 Mg ha(-1)). Late-spring N application applied as a sidedress resulted in 25% lower NO3-N leaching losses with subsurface drainage water in comparison with preplant single N application and also significantly (P = 0.5) higher corn grain yield by 13% (8.4 vs. 7.4 Mg ha(-1)). These results clearly demonstrate that chisel plow tillage with late-spring soil test based N application for corn after soybean can be a sustainable farming practice for the northeast part of Iowa.

AB The relationship between Ascaris lumbricoides infection and provisions for safe water supply and excreta disposal was investigated in Ajebandele and Ifewara, 2 pert-urban communities near Ile-Ife, Osun State, Nigeria, from September 1998 to December 1999. Although there were more facilities for safe water supply (pipe-borne and shallow wells) and sanitation (flush toilets and pit latrines) in Ajebandele than in Ifewara, they were not evenly distributed and only a few families, mainly in Ajebandele, were well provided for. Our results indicated that the prevalence of A. lumbricoides was significantly higher in Ifewara (21.2%) than in Ajebandele (13.1%), and within villages was much lower in houses with tap water and flush toilets. However, the mean intensity of infection was unexpectedly higher in Ajebandele (166.5 +/- 692.0) than in Ifewara (153.1 +/- 485.8) suggesting that the present level of investment in Ajebandele is probably not sufficient to reduce morbidity. These findings confirm suggestions that there is a threshold level of investment below which interventions on water supply and sanitation may not significantly improve human health. Sustainable ascariasis control in the study communities will require significant improvements to existing water supplies and sanitation facilities and any future interventions should incorporate a programme of health education to ensure that the facilities provided are properly used and hygienically maintained.

AB A prospective study was conducted in 24 districts in southern Thailand in 1999 with directly observed treatment, short-course strategy (DOTS) implemented to determine treatment outcomes in relation to the practical observer among 455 enrolled patients with tuberculosis. Health personnel (HP), community members (CM), family members (FM) and self-administration (SA) were initially assigned to be DOT observers in 43%, 5%, 44% and 8% of 411 analysed patients, respectively. In practice, 56% of the 379 patients with assigned observers changed their observers. The practical observer was the assigned observer among 17% of patients assigned to HP, 57% to CM, 75% to FM, and 34% to SA, respectively. There were no significant differences in treatment success between different types of main observers. Adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence interval) of treatment non-success were 1.1 (0.3-4.7), 0.7 (0.2-3.3), and 0.5 (0.2-1.1) for HP, CM, and FM, over SA groups, respectively. HP may not be the best choice in our setting due to poor sustainability and the availability of another promising choice (CM).

AB A macroscopic assessment of the impacts of private and public transportation systems on the sustainability of the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) is undertaken from economic, environmental and social perspectives. The methodology draws upon the urban metabolism and sustainability indicators approaches to assessing urban sustainability, but compares modes in terms of passenger- kms. In assessing the economic sustainability of a city, transportation should be recognized as a product, a driver and a cost. In 1993, the traded costs of automobile use in the GTA were approximately balanced by the value of the automobile parts and assembly industry. But local transit costs 1/3 to 1/6 of the auto costs per person-km, in traded dollars, mainly because local labour is the primary cost. Public transportation is more sustainable from an environmental perspective. Automobile emissions are a major contributor to air pollution, which is a serious contemporary environmental health problem in Toronto. Public transportation modes are less energy intensive (including indirect energy consumption) and produce CO2 at an order of magnitude lower, although these benefits are partially undermined by under-utilization of transit capacity and the source of electricity generation. The social benefits of automobile use are likely more significant than costs in determining GTA residents' preferential mode choice. The speed and access of auto use provide important economic benefits, e.g. relating to employment and product choice. Nevertheless, offsetting the service attributes of private transportation are large social costs in terms of accidents. The costs of automobile insurance provide one tangible measure of such negative impacts. In order to improve the sustainability of the GTA, innovative approaches are required for improving the performance level of public transportation or substantially reducing the need for the service level provided by automobiles. Efforts such as greater integration of bicycles with public transit, or construction of light-rail systems in wide roadways, might be considered. But to be sustainable overall, a transportation system has to be flexible and adaptable and so must combine a mixture of modes.

AB Local economic development (LED) is a common community-based development response to changes in the economic fortunes of a locality. Various economic strategies are associated with LED, some of the most prominent being those of place marketing and attempts to refocus economic activity along new or previously underused avenues, with tourism promotion being an increasingly common option. The authors examine the responses of the small community of Still Bay in Western Cape Province, South Africa, to economic crisis and the absence of vital social facilities. Critical to the success and sustainability of this LED initiative was the establishment of various community development projects, in which certain key actors took a leading role in bringing the community together. Community cooperation, linked with successful place marketing and tourism promotion strategies, has laid the basis for the economic revival of the town and empowerment of historically disadvantaged groups.

AB Recent scientific advances are providing an opportunity to revisit strategies for cervical cancer prevention. How to invest health resources wisely, such that clinical benefits are maximized-and opportunity costs are minimized-is a critical question in the setting of new technology. In addition to an intervention's effectiveness, public health decision-making requires consideration of its feasibility, sustainability and affordability. No clinical trial or single cohort study will be able to simultaneously consider all of these components. A mathematical simulation model can be a useful tool with which to evaluate alternative cervical cancer control strategies by extending the knowledge from empirical studies to real-world situations. Models combine information about the natural history of disease with other relevant demographic, epidemiological, and economic characteristics. We describe a comprehensive Cervical Cancer Policy Model with a flexible structure that may be modified as new data on the biology of disease become available. This model provides an analytic framework to synthesize data on costs and benefits, to help design clinical guidelines, and to inform development of sound health policy. Examples of cost-effectiveness analyses conducted in the US and South Africa illustrate inevitable tradeoffs when choosing among a variety of interventions to decrease cervical cancer mortality, and demonstrate how these methods can facilitate a bridge between research and health policy.

AB Changes in methanogenic population levels were followed during startup of a full-scale, farm-based anaerobic sequencing batch reactor (ASBR) and these changes were linked to operational and performance data. The ASBR was inoculated with anaerobic digester sludge from a municipal wastewater treatment facility. During an acclimation period of approximately 3 months, the ASBR content was diluted to maintain a total ammonia-N level of approximately 2000 mg l(-1). After this acclimation period, the volatile solids loading rate was increased to its design value of 1.7 g l(-1) day(-1) with a 15-day hydraulic retention time, which increased the total ammonia-N level in the ASBR to approximately 3600 mg l(-1). The 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) levels of the acetate-utilizing methanogens of the genus Methanosarcina decreased from 3.8% to 1.2% (expressed as a percentage of the total 16S rRNA levels) during this period, while the 16S rRNA levels of Methanosaeta concilii remained low (below 2.2%). Methane production and reactor performance were not affected as the 16S rRNA levels of the hydrogen-utilizing methanogens of the order Methanomicrobiales increased from 2.3% to 7.0%. Hence, it is likely that during operation with high ammonia levels, the major route of methane production is through a syntrophic relationship between acetate-oxidizing bacteria and hydrogen-utilizing methanogens. Anaerobic digestion at total ammonia-N levels exceeding 3500 mg l(-1) was sustainable apparently due to the acclimation of hydrogen-utilizing methanogens to high ammonia levels.

AB This paper explores the complexities associated with globalization within the context of salmon farming in southern Chile, specifically whether the high levels of foreign investment and exponential growth in the industry have had a positive or negative impact on the people and communities of the archipelago of Chiloe. It is our argument that the responses to this issue require a subtle understanding of both the dynamics of community and the dialectics of modernity. We find substantial evidence that surplus labor, low wage levels, and poorly enforced or nonexistent health and safety standards are conditioning factors in the success of salmon farming in southern Chile. We conclude that a "sustainable community" approach is preferable to a "social sustainable" approach as the former focuses attention on the entire range of issues important to communities and the options open to them in confronting wider structures that affect their lives.

AB Nanoscience and technology are not exactly new, but nevertheless rapidly expanding fields that are providing revolutions in all sciences on the scale of what genomics and proteomics have done in recent years for the biological sciences. Nanoscience is based on the fact that properties of materials change as a function of the physical dimension of that material, and nanotechnology takes advantage of this by applying selected property modifications of this nature to some beneficial endeavor. The prefix 'nano' is used because the property dependence on physical size is generally observed close to the nanoscale, somewhere around 10(-9) m. The dimensions at which changes are observed depend on the specific material and the property in question, as well as which of the three dimensions are restricted in real space (e.g. small particles vs. thin films vs. 'one-dimensional' phases). Properties change in these confined spaces because the electronic structure (i.e. the distribution of electron energies) of the material is modified here in the gray area between the bulk and atomistic/molecular realms, or equivalently between the continuum and strictly quantum domains. Earth materials with at least one dimension in the nanorange are essentially ubiquitous. Many have been known for several decades and more are being discovered all the time. But the scientific emphasis has now shifted to that of measuring, understanding and ultimately predicting the property changes from the bulk to nanodomains, and to the understanding of the significant ways that Earth processes are affected by these changes. In addition, where possible, Earth scientists are using nanoscience to develop nanotechnology that should play important roles in Earth sustainability issues of the future.

AB As elsewhere, in the Indian Himalayan Region, ethnic communities in the state of Uttaranchal rely, to a large extent, on native plant species for sustenance of their traditional health-care system, both logistically as well as economically. However, the present scenario shows a decline in these traditional, plant-based health-care practices. These age-old practices are conservation-oriented and have tremendous potential to uplift the state economy. The excessive extraction of medicinal plant resources for use in the pharmaceutical industry has resulted in ruthless destruction of natural populations of medicinal plants. This work attempts to assess the current status of knowledge of medicinal plant resources of the state. It also focuses on the importance of documenting traditional knowledge and practices related to conservation and sustainable utilization of medicinal plants in Uttaranchal. A collaborative work plan involving scientists, government institutions and non-governmental organizations is suggested for preserving the traditional knowledge system and practices, conservation of medicinal plants and upliftment of the rural economy of this mountain state.

AB Sustainable management of acidic mining lakes requires knowledge on the origin and reactivity of its sedimentary organic matter. We identified different pools of organic matter (OM) in the Fe-rich sediment (up to 35 wt%) of an acidic (pH 2.8) mining lake using delta(13)C-signals, C/N ratios, and the markers alkanes, lignin-derived phenols, and benzenepolycarboxylic acids (BPCA). Additionally, a density fractionation was applied to each sediment layer. Three fractions, aquatic (AOM),terrestrial (TOM), and lignite-derived (LOM) organic matter, were discriminated, of which AOM comprises only a small fraction, with a minimum at the sediment bottom. The terrestrial contribution to sedimentary OM is higher than that of AOM but still low throughout the sediment core, whereas lignite-derived OM constitutes the major C-fraction, even in the upper sediment layers. The size of the carbon pools was quantified with a mass-balance approach, in which the BPCA content was utilized as an estimate for the lignite fraction in combination with the delta(13)C-signals of the three C fractions. The largest amount of OM was found in the heaviest (> 2.4 g cm(3)) of the three density fractions of the two upper sediment layers, which implies strong interaction with iron hydroxides. Comparisons with C-oxidation rates revealed that besides the refractory origin of the OM, sorptive preservation by solid iron phases controls C-reactivity in the sediment and, hence, the internal neutralization capacity of the lake system.

AB In publications on tropical forest fragmentation, regrowing secondary forests (SF) on abandoned agricultural land are often overlooked. These forests represent highly fragmented components in the landscape matrix which are generally less than 100 ha in size. SF are found on privately owned land where they are contributing to on-farm income through logging and/or use of non-timber products. Hence, defining pure conservation goals for this forest type seems to be unrealistic. In this paper, we used the process-based model F(ORMIX)3-Q to simulate successional processes and logging scenarios in SF exposed to different degrees of fragmentation (either facing non-forest land on only one side or totally surrounded by agricultural land) in the subtropical eastern part of Paraguay. We compared results with primary forest embedded in a similar matrix. Under light fragmentation, bole volume of SF approached primary forest values after about 50 years of succession. Species composition, however, was clearly distinct from primary forest over the first 200 years of succession. The development of bole volume and species composition in severely fragmented SF was similar to the less fragmented SF over the initial 50 years. However, limited seed input, largely confined to on-site seed sources in the severely fragmented SF, led to a decline in bole volume by about one-third compared to the reference value over the simulation period of 400 years. By applying a minimum felling diameter (MFD) of 35 cm in the lightly fragmented SF, first logging was only possible after 30 years, resulting in a mere 3.7 m(3) ha(-1) harvest. Highest timber yields were obtained with 10 yr cutting cycles and a maximum removal of 20 stems ha(-1), though sustainable yields only resulted from lowering the MID to 30 cm. Logging in severely fragmented SF accelerated the decline of bole volume. Overall, results suggest that timber production in SF without silvicultural treatments is low and hence does not constitute a viable option to diversify farm income. Only managed SF may serve this function. Research focusing on the elaboration of management options for SF, integrating as much as possible of the original vegetation, is needed.

AB In one of the longest time series available, we present a comparison between forest inventories of 1924, 1964 and 1999 of an 800 km(2) forest-harvesting area in Central Guyana. Harvesting mainly targeted one species Chlorocardium rodiei (Greenheart), of which the population declined by 63% over the 75 years of harvesting. The decline of the population was not only detectable in the harvested size classes (>30 cm) but also among the smaller size classes. In 1999, however, Greenheart still ranked third in abundance. There was little change in the overall species composition, proportion of disperser groups or proportion of functional groups in the tree community. There were also no detectable changes in tree diversity. The conservation value of these unique forests can still be considered high. Thus, while the long-term sustainability of Greenheart harvesting is low, other ecological criteria of sustainability are met. Short-term recovery of Greenheart is not to be expected due to low population growth and small numbers of seed trees. Strategic choices will have to be made with regard to harvesting the remaining Greenheart stands-three scenarios are discussed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Pterocarpus angolensis is being cut for construction and medicinal purposes through much of southern Africa. To assess the sustainability of this offtake, we estimated current harvest practice, population size structure, growth rates and seed production in protected and unprotected areas of Rukwa Region, western Tanzania. Results showed that adult P. angolensis are being removed very rapidly given its slow growth rate as determined from tree ring data, and that regeneration both inside and outside the protected area is very low. A simple model indicates that current harvest is unsustainable raising serious concerns about the long-term viability of this important hardwood species in miombo woodland.

AB We consider the mechanism of certification to encourage sustainable harvesting and best management practices of Iriartea deltoidea Ruiz and Pavon, in the context of current land use and agricultural management in Amazonian Ecuador. Interviews and observations with harvesters, storeowners, and furniture-makers provided information about current and potential markets for goods made from the palm. To understand the demographic variables that are critical for population stability, data from five plots in each of three different forest types (mature, secondary, and dissected) were collected. Matrix models were used to develop harvesting simulations through which biological constraints on sustainable harvesting were explored. These simulations suggest that sparing individuals 5-15 m tall when pastures are cleared and adding this palm to current agroforestry polycultures can improve the likelihood of sustainable harvesting for this species. Results showed that harvesting Iriartea could fit within current land use. Some forest colonists clear pastures to graze cattle, while others devote land to agriculture, including polycultures of annuals and perennials. In either case, palms can be left standing when forests are cleared. Swidden agriculture (slash and burn or slash and mulch) depends on a fallow period during which secondary forest may begin to regenerate. These secondary forests are ideal locations for extraction of forest products that fit within the cycle of fallow regeneration in areas near human settlements. Sparing Iriartea individuals 5-15 m tall could benefit agriculture, encourage the sustainability of future harvests, and help ensure the future of this palm as a part of the Amazonian landscape.
   Interviews with staff of governmental and non-governmental conservation organizations investigated the policy context for certification as a mechanism for conservation. Establishing guidelines for harvesting requires input from all stakeholders in the decision, not simply an ecological analysis. Such guidelines for certifying good management practices, if they are developed, should include provisions for monitoring unanticipated consequences of harvesting or changes in future environmental conditions. Transportation issues and stem drying processes need to be addressed if efforts to expand markets are to succeed. More generally, guidelines for management of forest resources can be improved by combining ecological and social research perspectives; the potential for carrying out such guidelines can be improved by incorporating the knowledge of local forest dwellers and NGOs.

AB Recent years have seen increasing attention being focused on the concept of the,sustainable economy'. Variously interpreted, the concept is used to encompass energy conservation, the reduction in greenhouse gasses, environmental protection, recycling and the conservation of natural resources. To the developing world, it represents a challenge (constraint) on achieving economic parity with the developed world without extensive pollution of the environment. To the developed world, it represents a challenge to maintaining access to sufficient raw materials to achieve continuing economic development without compromising the opportunities for self-development of future generations and without passing on increasing environmental burdens to the developing world. In this age of the global enterprise, manufacturing bears a particular responsibility for achieving international standards for sustainability. This paper explores the extent to which the fundamental issues of sustainability in manufacturing are currently being addressed and the extent to which the public consciousness is ready to support sustainability in the design and manufacture of consumer products.

AB Over the past few years, the German economy has undergone a radical restructuring process. The work organization in producing units has also changed fundamentally. Under the heading 'implementation of team work', task-oriented structures based on the division of labour have been transformed into decentralized integrated structures. However, the adaptation of boundary conditions, like the remuneration system, has not been considered sufficiently, which is the cause of several problems in the restructured domains of the companies. Based on a study by the Fraunhofer Institute for Industrial Engineering, Stuttgart, in 2000, the paper describes the effects of the implementation of teamwork on remuneration strategies in producing units. Exclusively, skill-based systems, for instance, have been replaced by performance- and profit-related systems. When producing units of restructured companies, output quantities are not the only performance measures used. The application of quality-, time- or cost-oriented characteristics open up possibilities to match the new requirements companies are confronted with. The propagation of teamwork also effected the propagation of team-oriented remuneration systems. Furthermore, the paper tries to evaluate different conventional remuneration systems owing to their aptitude to be implemented in innovative work organizations. Criteria, for instance, are the motivation to increase performance and improve profit orientation, the limitation of the payload, the limitation of the expense of maintenance of the remuneration system, the improvement of team cooperation, the possibility of multiple objective control, and the dynamization of remuneration systems. In the following, success factors of innovative remuneration systems for modern work organizations are discussed. These success factors are summarized in detail under the heading 'performance and profit orientation instead of pure skill orientation', 'improvement of cooperation and motivation of the individual', 'enlargement of the conception of performance' and 'dynamization of remuneration systems'. A short overview on the further development of remuneration systems is also given.

AB The report of the World Commission on Forests and Sustainable Development [(1999) Our Forests, Our Future: Report of the World Commission on Forests and Sustainable Development (Cambridge Univ. Press, Cambridge, U.K.)] has called attention to a global need to restore the functional integrity of nature. The assumption that the biophysical world is capable of supporting any intensity of economic and political activity is now obviously wrong. The failures are seen as global changes such as the global climatic disruption now underway. The global disruptions are the product of cumulative local disruptions. Despite a conspicuous need, the scientific community has been slow in developing tools to appraise the functional integrity of landscapes. The proposal is advanced that the first steps deal with forests because they are so large in their influences on global biophysics. Analyses carried out by the commission are elaborated here as an index of functional integrity in the forest zone. The proposal is based on a simple, transparent approach. The scale is 0-100 with 100 as the nominal climax. Decrements and increments are applied as the structural and functional integrity of the landscape varies with whatever cause. The unit of area for these trials has been 10,000 hectares. The index has been applied to extremes such as the large extractive reserves in Acre, Brazil (100), the once-forested landscape of Haiti (0), and a managed forest stand in Maine. The analyses offer a scalar system for defining how well landowners and governments are protecting the public's interests in the integrity of the habitat of all.

TI The role of desalination in bridging the water gap in Jordan
SO DESALINATION

DE Jordan; water demand; water gap; desalination; brackish water; seawater
AB The water resources of Jordan have always been scarce. The demand for water in the country exceeds the available resources and the gap between the water supply and demand is continuously increasing. Furthermore, the quality of water resources has dramatically deteriorated in recent years, which prevented the utilization of some resources. To secure the economic sustainability of the country, it is important at this stage to consider non-conventional water resources, such as sea and brackish water desalination. This study examines the water resources of Jordan, projected water demand, and the gap between the demand and supply based on two scenarios. The possibility of closing this gap by water desalination was investigated. Both sea and brackish water desalination were considered. The analysis revealed that seawater desalination process is economically infeasible for domestic water uses at this stage. This is attributed to that Jordan is not an oil producing country and the location of sea shoreline in Aqaba is on the Red Sea, away from the consumption centers. However, seawater desalination may be a viable option for tourist and industrial enterprises that will be established as a result of the new Law of Aqaba Free Zone. The most convenient and realistic option for Jordan in the short term, is the desalination of brackish water by reverse osmosis (RO). The brackish water with total dissolved solids between 2000-10000 mg/l is available from many aquifers and springs of the country. The study concluded that Jordan is facing a severe water crisis. Until recently, the water planners have not given the water desalination the required attention as a potential source of water supply. Taking into account the progress that is being achieved in the field of desalination technology, Jordan has to consider the desalination option more seriously and to start building a national capacity in the field of water desalination. It was emphasized that desalination is not a substitute to traditional water resources, it is rather a supplementary source that can contribute in bridging the water gap of the country.

AB The production of heat and electricity can cause large environmental impacts and, hence, large costs for society. Those are costs that are seldom taken into consideration. An important question is how the future technical energy systems should be formed if environmental costs were considered as any other good or service, such as raw material, capital and labour. This study comprises cost-effective technical measures when monetary values of external effects are included in an energy system analysis. It is an analysis of how the present energy system can for society be cost-effectively reconstructed to be more sustainable. A regional energy system model has been developed to perform the study and it concentrates upon production of heat in single-family houses, multi-dwelling buildings, non-residential promises and district heating systems. The analysis adopts a business economic perspective, using present prices of energy carriers, and a more socio-economic perspective, in which external costs are included. The result of the analysis is the optimal mix of energy carriers as well as new and existing heating plants that minimizes the costs of satisfying a demand for heat. The results show that it is profitable to invest in new heating plants fuelled with woody biomass. Furthermore, the external costs arising with satisfying the demand for heat can decrease substantially, 60%, by carrying through with the investments that are cost-effective according to the institutional rules valid today. When monetary values of external costs are taken into consideration, this number is additional 5-percentage points lower. It is shown that if environmental costs are included it is more expensive to continue with business as usual than it is to reconstruct and run a more sustainable energy system.

TI Adhesives for bead fusion of recycled expandable polystyrene
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED POLYMER SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
DE powder adhesive; recycling; bead fusion
AB Expandable polystyrene (EPS) is a plastic cellular material that is commonly used in the packaging industry. Its growing uses have led to environmental concerns over resource sustainability and the dwindling availability of landfill spaces. Although existing approaches to control and manage EPS wastes are available, much effort is still needed to recycle as much of the used materials via developing new processes or applications. This article looks into a new approach using adhesives to promote EPS bead fusion. Two sets of test specimens made of 100% recycled EPS using spray adhesive and powder adhesive were investigated. Their mechanical behaviors of these two adhesive EPS samples were studied. These specimens were compared with the commercially available ones produced using steam injection molding and direct microwave molding. From the findings, the powder adhesive specimens were found to be quite comparable to the steam-injected ones in terms of better cushioning property, shape definitions, smaller dimensional and density variations than those of sprayed adhesive and microwave ones. The results highlight that powder adhesive mixed with 100% recycled EPS offer a new "green" approach in EPS production with low initial capital outlay and shorter production lead time.

AB Cumulative adverse experiences, including negative life events and early childhood adversity, together with parental depression and/or non-supportive school or familial environments, place young people at risk for developing depression.
   Enhanced life skills and supportive school and family environments can mediate the effect of stressful life events.
   Programs that enhance the school environment are associated with improved behaviour and wellbeing.
   Interventions that teach cognitive skills are associated with a short-term reduction in depressive symptoms.
   Current evidence suggests that for an intervention to be sustainable it must encompass multiple components across several levels: classroom, curriculum, whole school, and the school-community interface.
   Teaching interpersonal skills, including cognitive and problem-solving skills, should be coupled with the promotion of positive school and family environments to prevent depression in young people.

AB In this article, I offer theoretical and empirical groundwork for the study of intergenerational issues and highlight the relevance of,intergenlerational behavior to organizations. I focus on situations involving conflict between generations in which a present generation must give up benefits or take on burdens to act on the behalf of future generations. I introduce the notion of intergenerational reciprocity and, in four studies, found that the behavior of previous generations influences how a present generation treats future generations.

AB Previous research on organizational citizenship behavior indicates that such behavior is critical for organizational effectiveness, but little theoretical work details how it might contribute to enhanced organizational functioning. Nahapiet and Ghoshal (1998) argue that a firm's social capital comprises a critical source of sustainable organizational advantage. Based on their work, we suggest that citizenship behaviors enhance firm functioning by contributing to the development of social capital in organizations; specifically, citizenship behaviors contribute to the creation of structural, relational, and cognitive forms of social capital.

AB Mectizan (Ivermectin) has been proved to be central to the control of onchoceriasis through self-sustainable community-based-treatment. The possibility of parasitological unresponsiveness to this treatment or selection for drug resistance has emerged recently in many occasions. The reason for the reduced ability of Mectizan to maintain low levels of dermal microfilariae and early recurrent pruritus can only be speculated upon. Here, we report our own findings to address this particular issue. Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

   grazing industry in temperate Australia

AB CSIRO Plant Industry has developed the GRAZPLAN family of decision support tools (DS tools) for consultants and farmers to improve the profitability and environmental sustainability of grazing enterprises. These tools are based on pasture and animal production models that have general application for simulating the biophysical processes of grazing systems in temperate southern Australia. The DS tools are designed to be easy to use and, apart from daily weather information, require minimal input of data. Where relevant, the models run continuously over a range of specified years, without further intervention by the user. The output generated can be linked to cost and price indices to enable estimation of production risk in financial as well as in biological terms.
   Adoption of GrazFeed, a tool to guide livestock nutrition, is widespread in the southern states where it is a keystone for the very successful PROGRAZE extension program sponsored by NSW Agriculture and Meat and Livestock Australia. GrazFeed's success is linked to the release of national feeding standards for ruminants, to the tactical nature of decisions about livestock nutrition and to a formal commitment by CSIRO, the developers, with NSW Agriculture, a major user. Adoption of another tool, GrassGro, which is used to analyse grazing enterprises for profit and sustainability, is slower. In this case the decision support is concerned with strategic planning where outcomes are probability-based and where the pasture model in GrassGro is not based on an agreed national standard. Confidence in the use of GrassGro increases where users are already familiar with GrazFeed, which contains an identical animal model. A key component of the commercial release of GrassGro is the provision of an intensive training course.
   Future adoption of the DS tools will be enhanced by their innovative use in teaching programs such as that at the University of New England where they are used in all undergraduate years of the rural science course. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB As pressure on land and forest resources increases, there is a growing need to assess and improve the sustainability of slash-and-burn agriculture in tropical uplands. On steep-hillslopes (24-32degrees) in the forest buffer zone of the Blue Mountains of Jamaica, following clearance of secondary forest the relative impact on surface runoff, soil erosion and soil properties of three land-use treatments: maintained weed-free without cultivation (bare); cultivated with herbaceous crops (agriculture); and cultivated with herbaceous crops and intercropped with Calliandra calothyrsus contour hedges (agroforestry) was assessed over a 5-year period and compared with an uncleared secondary forest control (forest). The forest provided good protection against surface runoff (which was consistently less than 0.2% of rainfall) and soil erosion losses (less than 500 kg ha(-1) per year); agriculture caused a seven-fold increase in surface runoff and 21-fold increase in soil erosion. However, agroforestry was effective in conservation of water (45% reduction in runoff compared with agriculture) and soil (erosion reduced by 35%). The clearance of the secondary forest led to large changes in most measured soil properties. Over 5 years concentrations of organic matter declined by 31%, total N by 38%, exchangeable K by 47%, Ca by 43% and Mg by 56%; over the same period bulk density increased by 48%. Of the soil properties more subject to year-to-year fluctuations, after 5 years the concentration of available P was 36% less in cleared plots than in forest, exchangeable Na was 50% less and moisture content 43% less. Only total P concentration and pH were unaffected. Five years after forest clearance there was no good evidence that these changes had stabilised and very little difference in soil properties was found amongst the three land-use treatments. However, within the agroforestry plots, exchangeable K, Na and sand concentrations became higher under the hedgerows than between them (by 14, 9 and 8%, respectively), whilst clay concentration became higher between them (by 9%). The results indicate that this low-input, contour-tree-hedgerow technology is effective at soil and water conservation through the sieve-barrier effect and increased water infiltration (respectively) and has the potential to enhance the sustainability of this land-use system at a plot scale.

AB Objectives: To describe an integrated, operational platform from which mail- and telephone-based health promotion programs are implemented and to specifically relate this approach to weight management programming in a managed care setting.
   Approach: In-depth description of essential systems structures, including people, computer technology, and decision-support protocols. The roles of support staff, counselors, a librarian, and a manager in delivering a weight management program are described. Information availability using computer technology is a critical component in making this system effective and is presented according to its architectural layout and design. Protocols support counselors and administrative support staff in decision making, and a detailed flowchart presents the layout of this part of the system. This platform is described in the context of a weight management program, and we present baseline characteristics of 1801 participants, their behaviors, self-reported medical conditions, and initial pattern of enrollment in the various treatment options.
   Conclusion: Considering the prevalence and upward trend of overweight and obesity in the United States, a need exists for robust intervention platforms that can systematically support multiple types of programs. Weight management interventions implemented using this platform are scalable to the population level and are sustainable over time despite the limits of defined resources and budgets. The present article describes an innovative approach to reaching a large population with effective programs in an integrated, coordinated, and systematic manner. This comprehensive, robust platform represents an example of how obesity prevention and treatment research, may be translated into the applied setting.

AB A sustainable and environmentally friendly procedure has been developed for the FTIR determination of caffeine in tea leaf samples. The method is based on the extraction with ammonia and CHCl3 and direct determination of caffeine on the chloroform extracts using peak height absorbance measurements at 1658.5 cm(-1) and external calibration. The method provides a sensitivity of 0.2142 absorbance units mg(-1) mL and a limit of detection of 1 mg L-1, corresponding to 0.002% m/m caffeine in tea leaves. As compared with a reference procedure, based on UV absorbance measurement at 276 nm after low pressure column chromatography, the developed procedure reduces the consume of CHCl3 by a factor of 10, that of NH4OH by a factor of 20 and avoids the use of diethyl ether and Celite. The time required to do the analysis of a sample is 15 minutes as compared with the 6 hours for the reference one.

DE sustainable tourism development; common pool resources
AB Sustainable development calls for wise management of natural, built, and sociocultural resources in destination areas. Resources created mainly for tourism are used in time by the local population as well. Many others are shared in common with local people in everyday life. More often than not, resources are overused and degraded, as is the unfortunate fate of most 'common pool resources'. When this happens, sustainable development is severely threatened: economic wellbeing declines, environmental conditions worsen, social injustice grows, and tourist satisfaction drops. This paper analyzes the central role that common pool resources play in sustainable tourism development, outlines policy design principles for their management, and offers future research directions, (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Problems of sustainability of water supply in tourist resorts are becoming an increasingly common and important issue in applied geography and environmental management. This paper examines the relationships between tourism and water supply on the Mediterranean island of Mallorca, discussing both the scale of the problem and recent measures to find a solution, particularly the proposed Hydrological Plan for the Balearic Islands (published in 1998/9). Since Mallorca lies in an area likely to be seriously affected by future climate change, its potential effects are discussed and evaluated. One of the most critical problems relates to the coarse spatial resolution of general circulation models for predicting precipitation in an area where precipitation regimes grade steeply from semi-arid to humid temperate. However, it is likely that a continuation of the marked inter-annual and decadal-scale variability in precipitation seen during the recent past probably poses a greater threat to Mallorca's water supply than the more gradual, progressive change typically predicted to accompany future global warming. Similarly, continued over-exploitation of coastal aquifers will be more critical to water quality issues than the direct impacts of any future sea level rise, although the latter would undoubtedly exacerbate these effects. The conclusion discusses the controversial new ecotasa ('ecotax'), due to be imposed on Mallorca's tourist industry in 2002, which is likely to represent only a partial solution to the long-term water supply problem. As the physical, cultural and economic environments of Mallorca are typical of much of the Mediterranean region, the implications of this issue extend well beyond the island's shores.

AB Many upland areas of the British Isles have seen declines in the area and condition of heather (Calluna vulgaris)-dominated heathland vegetation. To reverse this decline, management regimes must be designed to rehabilitate areas that have seen this decline. As most of this heathland vegetation is primarily managed by grazing, such management has to determine what stocking levels can maintain the vegetation in a desired state. This paper describes how to reverse this decline through suitable grazing management.
   A degraded 'wet-heath' system, previously grazed at 2.1 sheep ha(-1), was subject to a range of grazing treatments over a 5-year period. Treatments varied in intensity (0-1.4 sheep,ha(-1)) and timing (summer only, winter only, or year round) of grazing. Grazing levels were maintained at 2.1 sheep ha(-1) outside the fenced areas. Vegetation composition remained stable outside the fenced treatments. All the fenced treatments showed an increase in the relative frequency of the evergreen Calluna vulgaris, with the greatest increase being in the ungrazed treatment, and the least in the year round 1.4 sheep ha(-1) treatment. This increase was in line with a reduction in heather utilisation to relatively low and sustainable levels. Other species that benefited from reduced grazing included Carex nigra, Deschampsia flexuosa and to a lesser extent Galium saxatile and Erica tetralix, whereas a range of moss species including Hypnum jutlandicum and Rhytidiadelphus loreus were more frequent at higher grazing levels. Though the recovery of heather was similar in the two seasonally grazed treatments, the vegetation showed different overall trajectories. Winter only grazed allowed a substantial increase in the cover of the deciduous Molinia caerulea, whereas this species was kept in check by summer only grazing. A stocking level of between 0.7 and 1.4 sheep ha(-1) appears to be appropriate to maintain and even enhance the cover of heather on degraded wet heath. Complete removal is not necessary. Grazing restricted to the winter, period is inappropriate in areas where M. caerulea occurs. Setting appropriate stocking levels to maintain the condition of the vegetation must take into account site conditions, especially the presence of species that can affect the utilisation of heather.

AB Integration of a crop between the dry and wet season is known to capture nitrate-N which otherwise is lost upon flooding. Often a transition crop is of short duration and its biomass is incorporated into the soil as green manure. Although N dynamics as influenced by transition crop have been studied, not much is known about carbon dynamics and its residue management. Experiments conducted in four farmers' fields in the Philippines utilizing a rice- (Oryza sativa L.) sweet pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) system aimed to determine the effects of different transition crops like indigo (Indigofera tinctoria L.), indigo plus mungbean (Vigna radiata L.) and corn (Zea mays L.) grown during the dry-to-wet (DTW) transition on total and labile C pools. The decrease in labile C with cropping ranged from 6% to 21% and increase with residue incorporation ranged from 18% to 37% at different sites, but total C remained unchanged. The labile C balance indicated a loss of up to 1,438 kg halt due to farming practices and a gain of up to 3,077 kg ha(-1) with residue addition. Catch crop residue management in intensive rice-based cropping systems can play a role in maintaining soil health, as indicated by the improvement in labile C. Labile C is sensitive to soil management practices, and thus provides a better measurement of C dynamics in the short to medium term than total C alone.

AB A long-term soil fertility experiment (1988-1999) at the Regional Agricultural Research Station, Bhairhawa, Nepal, was analysed to determine: (1) how long the yields of rice (Oryza sativa L.) and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) can be sustained without K but with N and N+P (NP) applied with or without farmyard manure (FYM) and green manure, and (2) the impact of K application on yields. Starting from the 1995 wheat season, the experiment was modified to accommodate K at 0, 42, and 84 kg ha(-1) in plots receiving NP to study the response of rice and wheat to K. Both rice and wheat responded to K application but the response of wheat was substantially higher, indicating that the availability of native K may have been lower in wheat. Rice yields were lower in treatments without P than with P, and yields declined significantly (0.11-0.20 Mg ha(-1) year(-1)) in all the treatments except in NP and NP+FYM. Wheat yield was more adversely affected than rice yield when P and K were not applied. In addition, wheat yields were low (average 0.5-2.1 Mg ha(-1) in various treatments). Wheat yields declined (0.08-0.12 Mg ha(-1) year(-1)) in all but FYM treatments indicating the role of FYM in sustaining yields. The interaction of K deficiency with Helminthosporium leaf blight (spot blotch and tan spot) is also suggested as one of the factors limiting wheat yields. The estimated K balance in soil was highly negative. Results suggest that farmers should apply adequate amount of K for higher and sustainable rice and wheat yields.

ID VALIDITY; WELFARE; AGENCY
AB The heavily promoted Looking After Children: Good Parenting, Good Outcomes (LAC) project continues to exert a powerful influence on social work in the UK and elsewhere. Despite the repeated assertions that the documentation associated with LAC is embedded in 'objective' research, this not sustainable on account of the failure of the researchers to interrogate their own normative assumptions and judgements. Specific criticisms can also be levelled at the 'community study' connected to the evolution of the Action and Assessment Records (AARs) which are the key part of the scheme. The system should also be viewed in the context of wider pre-occupations about 'outcomes'. In addition, the project needs to be politically situated and the researchers' relationship with the Department of Health should be more fully explored. In conclusion, it is suggested that the LAC experience contains important 'messages' for the future of social work research.

TI Design with the climate in housing environments: an analysis in Northern
   Cyprus
SO BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE design; climate; housing; vernacular; Northern Cyprus
AB Today, we need one sector to show the way towards sustainable development. Housing, because of its ability as a total entity to satisfy all the levels of need, is in a unique position to set this example, of a more holistic policy which proactively considers the broader issue of the global environment together with local tradition (Oktay D. Planning Housing Environments for Sustainability: Evaluations in Cypriot Settlements, YEM Publications, Istanbul, 2001; WV Vliet (Ed.), The Encyclopedia of Housing, Sage Publications, London, 1999).
   So far as housing is concerned, local sustainable development deals with improving the quality of life of the local community through the prudent use of local resources. The aim, therefore, is for a high degree of local self-efficiency, which is related to the ecological site design as a determinant of urban ecology. In this context, certain design issues need to be addressed in new developments to meet requirements for sustainability. Design with climate is one of the most important criteria to be considered.
   Each region has its own climatic conditions and cultural patterns, which must be the basis for the solutions in each individual case. In fact, each country or region has a traditional settlement and building form or 'vernacular architecture'. Since these cases embody a great deal of experience, wisdom, and cleverness, the layout, basic design, and orientation of older buildings are worth studying in some detail for valuable clues and ideas. In particular, vernacular architecture is almost always climatically appropriate. Protection from sun and heat plays an important role in the areas with a hot climate during the summer months, while the problems of areas with a cold climate are quite different.
   To this end, this paper attempts to evaluate the housing settlements in Northern Cyprus where the vernacular urban and architectural patterns provide useful hints for designing more sustainable environments. In this context, the courtyard, the element providing the most significant climitic utility in a hot climatic region, will be introduced as a design tool for the new developments.

AB Starting from the precursors containing active metal species in the crystal structure, highly dispersed supported metal catalysts have been prepared by the calcination-reduction treatment. This method is named as "solid phase crystallization (spc)" method and was compared with the conventional impregnation (imp) method. As the precursors, both perovskite-type and hydrotalcite-type oxides have been utilized for preparing various supported metal catalysts, which were successfully applied for the reforming of CH4 and the decomposition of methanol. Especially spc-Ni/Mg-Al catalyst prepared from the hydrotalcite-type precursors showed high activity as well as high sustainability for the hydrogen production from methane.

TI Assessing progress toward the goals of coastal management
SO COASTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article; Proceedings Paper
CT Workshop on Cross Portfolio Learning in ICM
CY MAY, 2001
CL BLACK ISL, RHODE ISLAND
AB The fundamental purpose of all coastal management initiatives is to maintain, restore, or improve specified qualities of coastal ecosystems and their associated human societies. A defining feature of coastal management is that it addresses needs for both development and conservation in geographically specific places-be they a single community, an estuary, or the coast of an entire nation. The times required to achieve these fundamental goals at significant spatial scales far exceed those of the usual four- to six-year project, the dominant integrated coastal management (ICM) modality in developing nations. Two simple but elastic frameworks are offered for assessing progress over the extended time periods involved. The first is the four orders of outcomes that group the institutional, behavioral, and social/environmental changes that can lead to more sustainable forms of coastal development. The second framework is a version of the more familiar ICM policy cycle. These frameworks are applied to two portfolios of coastal management projects in Latin America and the Caribbean, each of which extended over four to five years with a total investment in excess of U. S.$15 million. The analysis reveals striking similarities in the assumptions that underpin the designs and the expectations of each project despite major differences in the contexts within which they operated. The results of these eight projects point to a need for operational frameworks to emphasize the linkages between different groups of activities and achievements. Greater care is needed to balance the capacity of the implementing institutions with the complexity of the issues to be addressed. In Latin America there is great uncertainty on how to proceed toward better coastal governance in the absence of either formal national mandates or the prospect of sustained funding for programs of demonstrated effectiveness. The evaluative methods discussed are proving useful in identifying a critical path for each initiative that can lead to the fundamental goals of coastal management and identify the learnings within each project that need to be incorporated along the way.

AB This paper describes the role played by FAO in the control of foot and mouth disease. Since 1954 the FAO European Commission for the control of foot-and-mouth disease co-ordinated the regional programme for eradication of FMD in Europe. One of the major achievements of the Commission has been to prevent the introduction and spread of exotic strains of foot and mouth disease into Europe through the Balkans. FAO also supports the activities of the Foot-and-Mouth Disease World Reference Laboratory located in the Institute of Animal Health, Pirbright, UK.
   The Infectious Diseases/EMPRES Group of the Animal Health Service, Animal Production and Health Division of FAO, promotes a global approach to the control and eradication of transboundary animal diseases over the world. For foot and mouth disease, the strategy is based on co-ordinated regional programmes. For FAO, no sustainable progress can be achieved in FMD control over the world without addressing and supporting the control of the disease in endemic countries. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

ID SPHENISCUS-HUMBOLDTI; SMALL CETACEANS
AB Between 1991 and the present, we have had observers stationed at the port of San Juan in southern Peru to interview fishers as they landed their catch. They observed the landings of 922 Humboldt Penguins (Spheniscus humboldti), 510 dusky dolphins (Lagenorhynchus obscurus), 214 Burmeister's porpoises (Phocaena spinnipinnis), and 75 bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) between November 1991 and June 1998, although the retention of penguins and small cetaceans is banned by Peruvian law. Most of these animals were captured in 1992-1994, when the fishers were mainly using surface-drift gillnets to target a pelagic schooling fish called cojinova (Seriolella violacea). Capture rates were much lower in 1995-1998, when fishers were mostly using fixed demersal gillnets and shellfish diving, due apparently to a lack of surface-schooling cojinova in the vicinity. We used generalized linear models to examine the effect of year, gear type, area, and target fish species on the probability of capturing either penguins or dolphins. We found that the probability of a fishing vessel capturing a penguin or a dolphin increased when drift gillnets were used instead of fixed gillnets. Fishing area, year, and the species of fish caught also significantly affected the probability of capture. A population model (Vortex) applied to Humboldt Penguins showed that the high levels of mortality seen in the early 1990s are not sustainable and could lead to local extinction in a few years. The mortality levels seen in the late 1990s are more likely to be sustainable, but a return to the use of drift gillnets would rapidly result in unsustainable levels of mortality.

TI Sustainability of harvested pacu (Colossoma macropomum) populations in
   the northeastern Bolivian Amazon
SO CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB The pacu (Colossoma macropomum) is an important commercial and subsistence fish resource in Amazonia. Pacu depend on the unique hydrology of the Amazon Basin, in particular the occurrence of annual floods, and require a healthy and intact flooded forest (varzea) for food resources during the wet season. From March to December of 1999, 128 pacu were collected and aged (by means of otoliths) from subsistence harvests in the town of Bella Vista, located at the juncture of the San Martin and Blanco rivers in northeastern Bolivia. The age structure of the harvested population implied a healthy and lightly exploited stock and suggested that sustainable harvest is occurring. Population parameters at our site were similar to the neighboring, lightly exploited Mamore River system but differed slightly from heavily exploited stocks in Brazil. Pacu harvested near Bella Vista are of special concern because of poaching and the increasing regional demand for fish, and because the varzea habitat on which the pacu depends is currently threatened by cattle production, development activities, and land-tenure conflicts. As development increases throughout Amazonia, careful management of pacu fisheries and the flooded forest on which they depend will be of critical importance.

TI Labeling and the realization of cultural values

AB Labeling plays a role of increasing significance as a technique to reveal, with adequate certification, the content of a product in both a physical and a moral sense by reporting, say, on labor conditions, environmental sustainability or animal friendliness of the product chain. Whereas voluntary labeling leaves all initiative to the private sector, under mandatory labeling the state imposes an obligation to label, often in conjunction with the requirement to meet official standards. Besides aiming to ensure product safety, standards derive from paternalistic motives and seek to mitigate external effects of consumption, to manage catastrophic risks, to improve the representation of the poor, and to preserve the cultural heritage. Nowadays, they are also used in the fight against crime and terrorism and for the protection of intellectual property rights. Standard-based labeling is a source of recurrent conflict because it serves both to protect the own culture and to export it. Developed countries fear that discretionary policies at a national level would harm their exports. They call for international harmonization of the standards but developing countries are reluctant to participate, because their exports might suffer, while antiglobalists denounce it as an instrument of domination by the North. The paper reviews the arguments on both sides. It adopts a WTO perspective in proposing that for non-product standards, international harmonization, rather than being attached to products, should apply to territories, be organized by subject and delegated to specialized international agencies that operate under the mandate of separate international treaties. But we differ from the WTO position when we argue first, that product as well as non-product standards should be modulated so as to reflect the cultural diversity across countries and their different stages of development, and second, that it should be permitted that countries refusing to sign a treaty should face import restrictions by signatories.

ID INVENTORY; INDUSTRY; ISSUES; GAS
AB This study aims to evaluate and estimate the environmental impacts of nuclear fuel cycles and to support the decision-making of nuclear energy policy, relating to a selection of environmentally preferred nuclear fuel cycle for the environmentally sound and sustainable development of nuclear energy. To achieve this objective, life cycle assessment (LCA) as an environmental management tool is applied to the nuclear fuel cycle alternatives of a once-through fuel cycle, the direct use of PWR spent fuel in CANDU (DUPIC) cycle and recycling with plutonium and uranium recovery by extraction (PUREX) process. The assessments provide a comparison of the environmental impacts of the three nuclear fuel cycle options and the environmentally most significant stages of each nuclear fuel cycle are identified. As a result, the recycling with PUREX process turned out to impose less-significant environmental impact than did the DUPIC and once-through options. The environmentally dominant stage was found to be mining/milling stage and the most radiologically significant pathway could be an internal exposure. The results are useful for making a decision of nuclear energy policy by an estimation of environmental impacts of nuclear fuel cycle options and the application of LCA to nuclear energy is very significant eco-labeling according to the advent of international standard organization 14,000 series. Finally, this approach also makes it possible to obtain the environmental data relating to the nuclear energy and to examine the environmental impacts of chemical effluents discharged from a nuclear facility. From this result, therefore, the comparative assessment of nuclear and non-nuclear energy sources including radiological and non-radiological aspects may be further developed.

AB This paper discusses the potential and utilization of geothermal energy in Turkey. Geothermal energy for electricity generation has been produced commercially since 1913, and for 4 decades on the scale of hundreds of MW both for electricity generation and direct use. Utilization has increased rapidly during the last 3 decades. In 2000, geothermal resources were identified in over 80 countries, and there are quantified records of geothermal utilization in 58 countries in the world. The worldwide use of geothermal energy amounts to 49 TWh/y of electricity and 53 TWh/y for direct use. On the other hand, Turkey is one of the countries with significant potential in geothermal energy. Resource assessments have been made many times by the Mineral Research and Exploration Directorate (MTA) of Turkey. The main uses of geothermal energy are mostly moderate and low temperature applications such as space heating and domestic hot water supply, greenhouse heating, industrial processes, heat pumps, and electricity generation. The data accumulated since 1962 show that the estimated geothermal power and direct use potential are about 4500 MWe and 31500 MWt, respectively. Present applications have shown that geothermal energy in Turkey and other countries is clean and much cheaper compared to the other fossil and renewable energy sources.

AB Many opportunities exist to take advantage of integrated surface water-groundwater management with consequent resource and investment savings. In inappropriate legal and administrative settings, groundwater becomes an open-access resource leading to excessive contemporary and inter-temporal externalities. Several policy instruments have been used to correct these externalities: limits in well spacing and capacities, pumping taxes and tradable pumping permits. Urban-agricultural competition for limited groundwater need not result in crises for either sector if these instruments are used to mediate the competition. In the case of non-renewable stocks of groundwater, rates of economic and demographic development should be planned in keeping with long-term criteria to avoid overly rapid exploitation of the resource, non-sustainable population levels and inappropriate investment in infrastructure. Island states and coastal areas have special problems related to saltwater intrusion and coastal subsidence that can be mitigated if not eliminated through the use of economic and physical measures. Five brief case studies illustrate these points.

SO ENVIRONMENT AND URBANIZATION

AB Porto Alegre is well known for its innovative social policies but less so for the environmental policies that are this paper's focus. The paper begins by describing the city's participatory budgeting system and the multiple interconnections it has with a wide-ranging environmental policy. Porto Alegre has the highest standard of living and the highest life expectancy of any Brazilian metropolitan centre. Virtually all its people have water piped to their homes and most have good-quality sanitation and drainage. The garbage collection system reaches virtually all households and has included a separate collection of recyclables since 1990; other programmes enforce industrial pollution control (including special provision in garages and petrol stations), keep down polluting motor vehicle emissions and ensure the re-utilization of organic wastes from parks and restaurants. The city has 14 square metres of green space per person and a million trees along its streets. This paper also describes the education and environmental information programme that underpins these policies, including changes to school curricula and the Environmental Atlas of Porto Alegre that provides the base information for environmental policy, environmental discussion and environmental education. The paper ends by discussing how sustainable development is impossible without good urban environmental management and how this, in turn, has to be built on democracy and participation.

AB This paper highlights the scope for making progress towards sustainable development through changes in current practices and decision-making processes that do not need international agreements. It outlines seven key areas for improving implementation, including: using monitoring and evaluation (and the information these produce) to change attitudes and behaviour; participation that involves the public constructively; better use of "soft" instruments of persuasion and communication; and ensuring that funding flows are structured to achieve the desired changes.

AB Understanding the environmental consequences of changing water regimes is a daunting challenge for both resource managers and ecologists. Balancing human demands for fresh water with the needs of the environment for water in appropriate amounts and at the appropriate times are shaping the ways by which this natural resource will be used in the future. Based on past decisions that have rendered many freshwater resources unsuitable for use, we argue that river systems have a fundamental need for appropriate amounts and timing of water to maintain their biophysical integrity. Biophysical Integrity is fundamental for the formulation of future sustainable management strategies. This article addresses three basic ecological principles driving the biogeochemical cycle of nitrogen in river systems. These are (1) how the mode of nitrogen delivery affects river ecosystem functioning, (2) how increasing contact between water and soil or sediment increases nitrogen retention and processing, and (3) the role of floods and droughts as important natural events that strongly influence pathways of nitrogen cycling in fluvial systems. New challenges related to the cumulative impact of water regime change, the scale of appraisal of these impacts, and the determination of the impacts due to natural and human changes are discussed. It is suggested that cost of long-term and long-distance cumulative impacts of hydrological changes should be evaluated against short-term economic benefits to determine the real environmental costs.

AB We examined the impact of single-tree selective logging and fuel reduction bums on the abundance of hollow-nesting bird species at a regional scale in southeastern Queensland, Australia. Data were collected on species abundance and habitat structure of dry sclerophyll production forest at 36 sites with known logging and fire histories. Sixteen bird species were recorded with most being resident, territorial, obligate hollow nesters that used hollows that were either small (<10 cm diameter) or very large (>18 cm diameter). Species densities were typically low, but combinations of two forest management and three habitat structural variables influenced the abundances of eight bird species in different and sometimes conflicting ways. The results suggest that habitat tree management for biodiversity in production forests cannot depend upon habitat structural characteristics alone. Management histories appear to have independent influence (on some bird species) that are distinguishable from their impacts on habitat structure per se. Rather than managing to maximize species abundances to maintain biodiversity, we may be better off managing to avoid extinctions of populations by identifying thresholds of acceptable fluctuations in populations of not only hollow-nesting birds but other forest dependent wildlife relative to scientifically valid forest management and habitat structural surrogates.

AB Ecosystem management and sustainable forestry on mixed ownership landscapes will require some level of cross-boundary coordination or management. Oregon's experiment with local, voluntary, collaborative forums, called watershed councils, is one mechanism to foster cross-bound-ary management. Fifty qualitative, in-depth interviews in three study areas were conducted with nonindustrial private forest (NIPF) landowners, watershed council members, and agency employees to learn how and why landowners participate (or not) on watershed councils. Study areas were located in three different areas of the state to reflect different ecological and organizational settings. Our case study identified three themes-stewardship ethic, property rights amid uncertainty, and action orientation-that were most salient among landowners when deciding to participate in their local watershed council. Other factors related to competing opportunities were also identified. Our results relate to the social psychological antecedents to cooperation of perceived consensus, group identity, and legitimacy of authority as well as to applied situations where cross-boundary coordination and management are goals.

AB Zooplankton and fish communities in mangrove creeks removed materials originating from the discharge of effluent from ponds used for shrimp aquaculture at two commercial farms in North Queensland, Australia. Undisturbed mangrove creeks were compared to creeks receiving effluent from shrimp farms. Shrimp farm effluent was rich in chlorophyll a (56 mug l(-1)) and bacteria (1.9 x 10(6) cells ml(-1)). The potential grazing impact of ciliates was higher than that of copepod nauplii or copepodids upstream. In contrast, copepods were more important downstream. Carbon removal by ciliates and copepods accounted for as much as 85% of primary production during non-discharge periods, but was less important during discharge periods. Direct measurement of microzooplankton grazing with the dilution method indicated that growth and grazing were usually in balance, but during pond discharge periods microzooplankton grazing removed >120% of primary production and 117-266% of bacterioplankton production in the mixed lower reaches of the creeks and immediately offshore. Grazing by bacterivores was saturated in the upper reaches of the creeks, but was very high near the creek mouths, where the range of specific grazing rates was 5.2-11.8 d(-1). Baitfish juveniles were abundant in the creek systems, and fed either directly on macro-particulates by indiscriminate filter feeding, or by selective feeding on microfauna. Trophic processes and their associated respiratory losses are instrumental in the assimilation and dissipation of effluent materials within the creek system, and are responsible for returning concentrations of bio-available materials to ambient levels. The sustainable use of coastal environments depends to a large degree on understanding and regulating the impacts from activities within the catchment. This research provides environmental managers with direct evidence that, under certain conditions, perturbations in creek water quality and biota originating from shrimp farm discharge are temporary.

ID PRODUCT
AB The art (and science) of successful product/service positioning generally hinges on the firm's ability to select a set of attractively priced consumer benefits that are:
   valued by the buyer,
   distinctive in one or more respects,
   believable,
   deliverable, and
   sustainable (under actual or potential competitive abilities to imitate, neutralize, or overcome)
   in the target markets that the firm selects. (While easily said, meeting all of these conditions is often the exception rather than the rule.)
   For many years, the ubiquitous quadrant chart has been used to provide a simple graph of product/service benefits (usually called product/service attributes) described in terms of consumers' perceptions of the importance of attributes (to brand/supplier choice) and the performance of competing firms on these attributes. This paper describes a model that extends the quadrant chart concept to a decision support system that optimizes a firm's market share for a specified product/service. In particular, we describe a decision support model that utilizes relatively simple marketing research data on consumers' judged benefit importances, and supplier performances on these benefits to develop message components for specified target buyers. A case study is used to illustrate the model. The study deals with developing advertising message components for a relatively new entrant in the US air shipping market. We also discuss, more briefly, management reactions to application of the model to date, and areas for further research and model extension. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Velvet bean (Mucuna pruriens (L.) DC. cv.-group utilis) is widely promoted in tropical and sub-tropical regions as a green manure cover crop that can reduce weed growth and soil erosion and enhance soil fertility. To provide these benefits, the crop must attain rapid ground cover and develop substantial aboveground biomass. To assist biophysical targeting of the crop to environments that can provide adequate growth conditions, the CROPGRO model was adapted to simulate velvet bean growth and development. This paper evaluates the performance of the model for phenology, growth, senescence and N accumulation for multiple locations that represent a range of environmental and agronomic management scenarios. Vegetative development, as described by main stem leaf appearance rate, varied linearly with thermal time. Time to flowering showed departures from the linear photoperiod response used in the model. Additional research is required to determine whether the crop is influenced by factors besides photoperiod and air temperature, especially water and nutrient deficits. The linear response to photoperiod did, however, provide reasonable values for partitioning to vegetative, reproductive and senesced materials. Simulation of nitrogen concentration for various plant components matched observed data. Sensitivity analyses evaluating the ability of the crop to provide ground cover, intercept light and develop adequate growth for soil protection and weed suppression indicated that a mean temperature of over 22 degreesC and a soil moisture holding capacity of at least 100 turn are required. The CROPGRO model proved to be a reliable decision support tool for guiding analyses of velvet bean response to crop management and environmental conditions. Further research, however, is warranted to improve its predictive capability, especially for phenology. Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

ID BLUEFIN TUNA; MANAGEMENT; ATLANTIC
AB In order to avoid recruitment overfishing, fish stocks must have sufficient reproductive ability. The spawning stock biomass (SSB), which ignores the value of immature fish, is widely used as an index of stock sustainability. From the perspective of sustainability, immediate reproduction, as well as future spawning, must be considered. We developed an index of long-term stock productivity, called the population reproductive potential (PRP). PRP is defined as the expected total reproductive value of the standing stock. We used PRP to assess the western Atlantic bluefin tuna (WBT) stock. The trends in SSB, numbers (N), biomass and PRP of WBT are inconsistent when compared to each other, due to fluctuation in age composition. We evaluated the long-term productivity of WBT by computer simulation and compared the result with trends in the abundance indices. The result of the computer simulation was highly consistent with the trend in the PRP. Short-term trends in SSB and N often do not reflect long-term stock trends, because they are highly sensitive to age-composition dynamics. The PRP is useful for evaluating stock trends, especially when the age composition is unstable.

TI Sustainability of elasmobranchs caught as bycatch in a tropical prawn

AB The bycatch of Australia's northern prawn fishery (NPF) comprises 56 elasmobranch species (16 families). The impact of this fishery on the sustainability of these species has not been addressed. We obtained estimates of catch rates and the within-net survival of elasmobranchs. Carcharhinus tilstoni, C. dussumieri, Rhynchobatus djiddensis, and Himantura toshi represented 65% of the bycatch. For most species, >50% of individuals in the bycatch were immature, and some species recruited to the fishery at birth. For all species combined, 66% of individuals in the bycatch died in the trawl net.
   The relative sustainability of elasmobranchs caught as bycatch was examined by ranking species with respect to their susceptibility to capture and mortality due to prawn trawling and with respect to their capacity to recover once the population was depleted. The species that were least likely to be sustainable were four species of pristids, Dasyatis brevicaudata, and Himantura jenkinsii. These are bottom-associated batoids that feed on benthic organisms and are highly susceptible to capture in prawn trawls. The recovery capacity of these species was also low according to our criteria. Our results provide a valuable first step towards ensuring the sustainability of elasmobranchs that are caught as byeatch by highlighting species for management and research. The effectiveness of turtle excluder devices (TEDs) in reducing elasmobranch byeatch varied greatly among species but was generally not very effective because most of the captured species were small.

AB Teaching organic chemistry should be a compulsory element in university education in the field of chemistry and related subjects. However, most curricula are still based on traditional laboratory classes in chemistry. They focus on teaching basic experimental techniques for synthesis and analysis and demonstrate potential chemical hazards. The efficiency of a chemical transformation is usually only measured by the chemical yield of the product obtained. Students do not learn how to determine the overall efficiency of a reaction, which directly correlates with its sustainability.
   The aspect of the efficiency and sustainability of a reaction must be added to the content of teaching courses in organic chemistry. Within this considerably wider scope students learn how to plan, set up, and analyse organic reactions taking their effects on man and the environment into account. Within an inter-university research project of nine institutes from seven universities we develop a free accessible internet database, which provides all necessary material, amongst others covering experimental procedures, toxicity data, alternative reaction procedures to discuss and assess a chemical reaction in a much wider sense. The provided information can be individually adapted to a specific course.

AB Sustainable development as a desired goal in construction is a result of recent legislation in Greece and its harmonisation with European Directives. In this study, in order to assess the implementation to the existing legislation of the sustainability issues in construction activities the related objectives examined were Energy Efficiency and Pollution Prevention (including Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reduction). The data used were collected from pioneer projects such as the Solar Village III in Lykovrisi Athens and the innovative heating system in Kozani West Macedonia Greece using real time control monitoring systems. The project data concerned with fuel consumption and basic pollutants (SO2, NOx, PM10). The comparison before and after the establishment of the pioneer project indicated that there is 45-70% reduction of fuel consumption, up to 25% reduction of dust and 35% of NOx, while SO2 was reduced up to 24%. Therefore, the corresponding sustainability indicators express a significant change and challenge for further implementation of such projects.

AB Culture shapes bow people identify and evaluate elements of their environment, and influences their behaviour and subjective experiences. At a more pragmatic level, culture provides the social infrastructure and institutions that determine how resources are used and managed. This article highlights the links between culture and natural resource management. The authors outline contrasting points of view on the role of culture in resource and environmental management, and attempt to mediate between these conflicting positions.

DT Article
ID POLICY; EVOLUTION; NETWORKS; WORLD
AB In recent years, transnational and domestic nongovernmental organizations have created non-state market-driven (NSMD) governance systems whose purpose is to develop and implement environmentally and socially responsible management practices. Eschewing traditional state authority, these systems and their supporters have turned to the market's supply chain to create incentives and force companies to comply.
   This paper develops an analytical framework designed to understand better the emergence of NSMD governance systems and the conditions under which they may gain authority to create policy. Its theoretical roots draw on pragmatic, moral, and cognitive legitimacy granting distinctions made within organizational sociology, while its empirical focus is on the case of sustainable forestry certification, arguably the most advanced case of NSMD governance globally. The paper argues that such a framework is needed to assess whether these new private governance systems might ultimately challenge existing state-centered authority and public policy-making processes, and in so doing reshape power relations within domestic and global environmental governance.

AB Low-income, multi-ethnic women are at elevated risk for obesity and chronic diseases, yet influences at different levels may act as barriers to changing risk behaviors. Following the birth of a child, childrearing and social isolation can exacerbate these influences. The social ecological framework integrates behavior-change strategies at different levels, providing a strong theoretical base for developing interventions in this high-risk population. The primary purpose of this randomized controlled trial is to test the efficacy of an educational model delivered by community-based paraprofessionals in improving diet, activity and weight loss among new mothers over a 12-month postpartum period and a 6-month maintenance period. This model fosters institutional change to support behavior changes influenced at intrapersonal and interpersonal levels, through collaboration with federal programs for low-income families: the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC), and the Expanded Food and Nutrition Education Program (EFNEP). Participants are randomized to the Usual Care, e.g. WIC nutrition and breastfeeding education, or Enhanced EFNEP intervention arm, consisting of Usual WIC Care plus a sustained, multi-component intervention including home visits, group classes and monthly telephone counseling. If shown to be efficacious, this program will be readily sustainable through existing federal agencies.

ID PRUNING SEVERITY; CONCORD GRAPES
AB 'Sunbelt' is a juice grape cultivar developed by the Univ. of Arkansas. This cultivar produces 'Concord'-type juice and is adapted to warm climatic conditions of the southern United States. Preliminary evaluation showed that 'Sunbelt' has potential to produce high-quality juice under the hot climatic conditions of the San Joaquin Valley. A study was conducted during the 1998 and 1999 growing seasons to further evaluate the adaptation of 'Sunbelt' to the San Joaquin Valley and determine the response of this cultivar to selected pruning methods. Vines were grown for two seasons without use of insecticides, fungicides, or herbicides. Vines were subjected to four pruning treatments: severe hand pruning (60-80 nodes retained/vine); moderate hand pruning (120-160 nodes retained/vine); machine pruning with hand follow-up (160-180 nodes retained/vine); and minimal pruning (200-400 nodes retained/vine). Vines were trained to a Geneva Double Curtain trellis system. Yield, components of yield, and juice quality were significantly impacted by pruning treatment. In both seasons, mechanized systems of pruning (machine and minimal) produced higher yield than hand pruning. Minimal pruning resulted in the highest yield (42 t(.)ha(-1)) in 1998, while yield from the machine-pruned vines was highest (29 t(.)ha(-1)) in 1999. Minimally pruned vines had the highest clusters/vine and lowest cluster weight among the treatments. The extremely high yields obtained for the minimal pruning treatments produced fruit that was less mature resulting in juice with lower soluble solids than the other treatments in 1998. However, in 1999 the juice from minimally pruned vines had the highest soluble solids. Sensory analysis of juice produced in 1999 showed that the juice from the machine-pruned treatment had the least color intensity. Sensory analysis showed that minimal and severe hand pruning were ranked higher for sweetness than machine and moderate hand pruning. In the second year of the study, the juice from the minimal-pruned and severe hand-pruned treatment were preferred over the moderate hand-pruned treatment or the machine-pruned treatment.

AB The use of mulches in vegetable production is undergoing a radical change away from high-input, nonrenewable resources, such as plastic, to the use of high-residue organic mulches from cover crops. The purpose of this study was to compare the marketable yield of various fresh-market tomato genotypes when grown under plastic and hairy vetch mulches. In 1996 and 1997, 12 fresh-market tomato genotypes were evaluated for yield on the North Farm of the Beltsville Agricultural Research Center (BARC), MD in a randomized split-plot design. Tomatoes were grown in conventional tillage plastic mulch (PM) and no-till hairy vetch mulch (HVM). Early blight, caused by Alternaria solani Sor., developed naturally in the plots both years and was recorded over time. All 12 genotypes were susceptible to early blight. Area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC) was calculated for each plot. AUDPC was similar both years. However, the year x mulch and year x mulch x genotype interactions were significant for AUDPC. Adjusting yields for AUDPC had a minimal effect on the data. Overall, yields were similar in PM and HVM both before and after adjusting for AUDPC. However, the mulch x genotype interaction was significant. The yield of eight of the genotypes was significantly higher in the HVM than in the PM system both years, ranging from 12% to 57% higher in 1996 and 10% to 48% higher in 1997. There was no yield difference for one genotype in HVM as compared to PM. The yield in the remaining three genotypes was either higher under HVM than PM or there was no difference. As yields from the HVM system are greater than or equal to yields in the PM system, soil compaction is reduced and nitrogen inputs are lower. The no-till HVM system is at least as good, and often better, than the conventional tillage PM system.

AB As an agroecosystem makes the transition from conventional to organic practices, changes in the pest management tactics used are often apparent. Despite varying degrees of efficacy among tactics, the issue of whether or not numbers of insect and nematode pests and their damage will become more severe in an organic system depends on the specifics of the pests and crops involved. Although many conventional systems rely on reactive strategies to deal with pest problems, an alternative approach is to redesign systems so that plant health is maximized, regardless of pest numbers, although this approach takes planning and time. An abrupt transition from conventional to organic may be risky if pest numbers are high and alternative practices are not yet in place. Hybrid systems, involving decreasing levels of conventional tactics and increasing levels of organic tactics, may be needed before the transitional period begins, in order to bridge the gap and lessen the impact of crop losses during the transitional period. The design of cropping systems with minimal pest impact requires a much more extensive and specific knowledge base than needed for reactive strategies.

AB Conventional agricultural systems increase per-area food production, but deplete natural resources and degrade both crop and environmental quality. Many of these concerns are addressed by sustainable agricultural systems, integrated pest management, biocontrol, and other alternative systems. Environmental and social concerns have escalated the need for alternative agricultural systems in the last decade. One alternative, the organic farming system, substitutes cultural and biological inputs for synthetically made fertilizers and chemicals for crop nutrition and pest management. Practices used for crop and pest management are similar during transition from conventional to organic farming systems, but produce is not certified to be organic during the transition period. During the transition from conventional to organic farming, growers may face pest control difficulties and lower yields when conventional practices are abandoned. The objectives of this paper are to 1) give an overview of the reasons for converting to organic farming and the challenges that growers face during the transition period, 2) outline some potential strategies for crop, soil, and pest management, and 3) list guidelines and recommendations for pest management during the transition to organic farming. Implementation of crop and pest management practices depends on geographical location, climate, available onsite resources, and history of the land. During transition, growers rely on cultural mechanisms and on organic and mineral sources to improve soil fertility, to build a population of natural enemies to suppress pest populations. Pest management practices during the transition period that reduce pest populations to economically manageable levels include crop rotation, cultivation, cover crops, mulches, crop diversification, resistant varieties, and insect traps. These practices also enrich the soil biota and increase crop yields before produce is certified organically grown.

AB Almond, [Prunus dukis (synonym Prunus amygdalus)] planted on approximately 595,000 acres (240,797 ha), is California's largest acreage tree crop. California's Central Valley accounts for nearly 100% of the U.S. domestic production of almonds. Integrated pest management (IPM) programs that integrate cultural practices and pest and disease monitoring with selective controls have improved plant protection in almond. Methods of orchard floor management and their effects must also be taken into account. Minimizing dust reduces mites while harvesting earlier and the destruction of overwintering refugia are cultural practices that reduce worm damage. Improved methods for field sampling and monitoring have reduced the need for pesticide applications while improving timing and effectiveness of needed crop protection sprays. Selective controls have further reduced the impact on nontarget species. Augmentative parasite releases have also helped manage navel orangeworm (Ameylois transitella). Effective use of new selective fungicides will require precise application timing and greater knowledge of diseases and resistance management. A better understanding of disease life cycles leading to improved monitoring of the fungal diseases, shothole (Wilsonomyccs carpophilus), almond scab (Cladosporium carpophilum), and anthracnose (Colictotrichum acutatum) have reduced fungicide applications. Future challenges include the potential loss of effective pest control products, the need to continually develop improved utilization strategies, and maintaining economic sustainability.

AB Anticipating the phaseout of methyl bromide, the USDA-ARS small fruit breeding program at Beltsville, Md., discontinued soil fumigation in strawberry breeding and selection trials in the mid 1990s. To address resulting weed and pathogen pests, a modified or advanced matted row system was developed. This system uses matted row-type culture, established on raised beds with subsurface drip irrigation and organic mulch. The mulch is the residue of a killed cover crop that fixes some nitrogen and provides an economical, biodegradable mulch for suppressing weeds and reducing erosion. Since 1996, the small fruit breeding program has conducted replicated performance trials on both advanced matted row and a regional adaptation of annual hill plasticulture. Both of these systems were managed without methyl bromide fumigation or fungicide application. Data from these trials were used to compare advanced matted row and plasticulture for yield, fruit quality and harvest season. Yield for the two systems was genotype dependent, and the advanced matted row system had later production and slightly lower fruit quality.

AB There has been no ubiquitously and unanimously accepted definition of the term ecohydrology (hydro-ecology). The present contribution aims to stir discussion, which may lead to getting closer to a consensus on the interpretation of the notion. A robust finding, holding across a range of existing definitions, is that the dynamically developing area of ecohydrology holds potential to be a very important tool serving sustainable development and management of water resources.

AB The increasing human population and degradation of biological integrity of ecosystems has been expressed, to a great extent, as a decline in water resources, the most critical factor to achieve sustainable development. This is because overexploitation and degradation of the biotic structure alters ecosystem processes to the point at which the ecosystem ability to provide desired resources is seriously diminished. The progress in ecology during recent years has created a background for integration of ecology and hydrology. UNESCO, under the International Hydrological Programme IHP-V, has initiated and provided a framework for such an interdisciplinary effort. During the programme, the conceptual background and principles of the surficial processes of ecohydrology were defined: first, by integration and quantification of biological and hydrological processes at the basin scale; second, by the enhancement of basin ecosystem absorbing capacity against human impact; and third, by using ecosystem properties as a management tool. Those principles are targeted, not only to eliminate threats, but also to amplify the opportunities for sustainable development as far as the control and regulation of nutrients and water cycling at the basin scale become possible. According to Popper's philosophy, the predictive planning of the future cannot be generated by extrapolating from recently used solutions. The integration of environmental sciences should create not only new scientific disciplines, but also a new solution which can face new challenges-sustainable management of the biogeosphere.

AB US federal agencies must consult with the National Marine Fisheries Service on actions that may adversely affect "essential fish habitat" (EFH). This EFH mandate coincides with recent discussions on proposed decommissioning of oil and gas platforms in southern California. While many species falling under the Pacific Groundfish Fishery Management Plan (e.g. rockfish, genus Sebastes) inhabit platforms, available information is insufficient for determining whether the structures are necessary to support a sustainable fishery or contribute to a healthy ecosystem, the two basic tenets of EFH. The occurrence of juvenile and large adult rockfish at some platforms suggests that they may support important ecological functions. Because rockfish show long-term population declines, further evaluation of platform ecological structure and function is warranted and should be integrated into the environmental review process.

TI Why was there no famine following the 1992 Southern African drought? The
   contributions and consequences of household responses
SO IDS BULLETIN-INSTITUTE OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
AB The 1992 southern African drought was the region's worst drought in living memory. The activities of poor smallholders, rather than food aid programmes, were largely responsible for averting famine. Purchases comprised the largest source of cereals for most villagers in 1992; for many households purchases provided 2-3 times as much staple food as relief programmes. Financing these purchases had adverse longer-term consequences for rural livelihoods, mainly due to large deteriorations in the rural terms of trade. The poorest drought-affected households cut expenditure on education and agricultural inputs (as well as on other less essential items), worked off their own land for longer than usual; and, in some cases, sold assets. Interventions before and during food crises should therefore complement and support the activities of the poorest and most vulnerable households, where they do not damage sustainable livelihoods, especially since these activities may compromise smallholders' ability to respond effectively to future food crises. Particular emphasis should be placed on interventions that minimise reductions in their purchasing power.

AB So-called 'neo-Malthusian' dimensions of famines and, in particular, the notion that population growth may outpace growth in the global food supply - are widespread today This article argues against such concerns for the near term future. While we hold that the world should be able to feed itself during the twenty-first century, we nonetheless also contend that in certain respects, population growth and population scale may be of considerable significance apropos the risk of future famines - especially if cognisance is taken of issues of global sustainability in the longer run. The article begins with a brief review of the chief demographic effects of famines - with special reference to their possible practical significance.

Starting from simple well-established formulas, the analysis show that there is an optimal sizing of the target supply voltage and pipe stage complexity to minimize power under a performance constraint. The verification of the model on five real processors is reported and discussed, and,the application to an ideal microprocessor design or redesign is illustrated.

AB A field study was conducted during 1995-96 and 1996-97 at New Delhi, on a sandy clay loam soil to study the effect of integrated nutrient management on sustainability of rice (Oryza sativa)-wheat (Triticum aestivum L. emend. Fiori & Paol.) cropping system. Although combinations of NP, NK and NPK significantly increased P and K content of soil over N alone by 2.5-5.7 kg/ha and 3-19 kg/ha, respectively, it had no significant effect on the productivity of rice-wheat cropping system. On the other hand combination of NPK + frameyard manure increased grain yield of rice-wheat system by 1.2-1.3 tonnes/ha, stray yield of 0.7-2.3 tonnes/ha, N uptake by 38-45 kg/ha, P uptake by 7-10 kg/ha, K uptake by 25-42 kg/ha, organic C content of soil by 0.09-0.15%, available N by 6-24 kg/ha, available P by 7-8 kg/ha and available K by 7-32 kg/ha over N alone. The increase in above parameters with NPK + FYM was higher in second year of study, indicating for sustainability of rice-wheat cropping system.

'D-PL 62' lentil produced 1928 kg/ha of grain, with an edge of 6.8% over 'L 4076' lentil. However, in intercropping, 'L 4076' lentil resulted in higher grain yield than 'DPL 62' lentil under all the spatial arrangements, indicating its better compatibility. The highest lentil-equivalent yield of 1989 kg/ha was noticed in 'L 4076'+ 'Neelam' intercropping under 6:2 row arrangement. The land equivalent ratio and area time equivalent ratio (ATER) Were the highest (1.15 and 1.09) in 'L 4076' lentil + 'Neelam' linseed under 6: 2 row arrangement indicating that this combination being more efficient in utilization of time and area. Linseed got more advantage in intercropping having higher relative crowding coefficient (1.59) and positive aggressivity (+0.31) than lentil.

AB Compared to surface water, groundwater has several disadvantages: its renewal is slow, its potential is more difficult to estimate, and its exploitation often requires more energy. However It has the advantage of a higher quality. The long-term storage effect of aquifers guarantees its continuous availability even in regions with wide temporal variations in precipitation. Although at a global scale groundwater use seems small compared with surface water, the order of importance is reversed if only drinking water is considered. Due to its quality limited vulnerability and relatively continuous availability groundwater is a resource of strategic importance. That is why its exploitation must be ruled by sustainability criteria. This work intends to describe in a general framework the basic criteria that must regulate the sustainable management of groundwater These criteria can be classified as quantitative and qualitative. Both criteria should be integrated to define groundwater resources management strategies. In the first part of this work, the quantitative aspects are emphasized. Among these criteria that rule the limitation of groundwater, drawdowns are of fundamental importance. New, recently developed tools for this purpose are described, which also establish the links between well hydraulics and the regional simulation of aquifers, such as non-Darcy flow, the interference of wells with non-Darcy flow, and the local optimization approach, among others, The international trends in this field are also discussed.

TI NATO, the Baltic states and Russia: a framework for sustainable
   enlargement
SO INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
LA English
DT Article
AB In this article the author discusses the projected enlargement of NATO, focusing on the candidacy of the three Baltic states. He examines the factors that have induced the Baltic governments to seek NATO membership, the steps the alliance has taken in the lead-up to the Prague summit in November 2002, the evolution of US policy with regard to the potential entry of the Baltic states into NATO, and the arguments that have sometimes been raised against Baltic membership. He argues that the admission of the Baltic states into NATO will be a step for-ward both for the alliance and for European security, but he believes that it should be accompanied by a restructuring of the alliance that would give much greater weight to its political dimension. One key objective of this restructuring would be to establish a closer relationship with Russia, moving beyond the NATO-Russia Council that Was set up in May 2002. The way to do this is not by treating Russia as a special case, but by encouraging the Russian government to apply for NATO membership (as other countries have) and then helping Russia to carry out far-reaching political and military changes that would eventually qualify it to enter the alliance.

AB The reduction of phytic acid content in grains by genetic manipulation is a novel approach to increase mineral absorption from food based diets. Low phytic acid corn (Zea mays), rice (Oryza sativa), barley (Hordeum vulgare) and soybean (Gycine max) genotypes have been generated and mineral absorption has been evaluated. Genetically modified low phytic acid plants could be a novel contribution to the reduction of micronutrient malnutrition and animal waste phosphorus. Nevertheless, additional research needs to be done to understand the molecular biology and genetics of phytic acid accumulation during seed development, the negative and positive roles of dietary phytic acid in human health and the feasibility and effectiveness of the sustainable implementation of this approach at the community level.

AB The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of a combined low-protein (CP) low-phosphorus (P) diet, supplemented with limiting amino acids and microbial phytase, on performance, nutrient utilization and carcass assessment of grower-finisher barrows. 4 x 6 crossbreed barrows were continuously housed in metabolism cages from 25 to 100 kg live weight and were fed diets, either conventional according to recent nutrient recommendations (A) or protein reduced (B) or protein and phosphorus reduced diets (C) based on barley (59-80%), maize (15%) and soybean meal (23-2%). Diet A (positive control) contained in fresh matter 18.5%, 15.6% and 13.6% CP and 0.59%, 0.51%, 0.50% P (growth phases I: 25-50 kg, II: 50-75 kg, III: 75-100 kg weight). Diet B was low in CP (14.2%, 13.4%, 11.0%), diet C low in CP and low in P (CP: as B, P: 0.46%, 0.41%, 0.32%). Diet D served as a negative control (CP and P as C). To diet B the limiting amino acids lysine, methionine, threonine and trypthophan were added to meet the levels in diet A, to diet C the limiting amino acids and 800 FTU Aspergillus-phytase per kg were supplemented. At the end of the balance periods of about 100 (A,B,C) or 133 (D) days, the barrows were slaughtered at 100 kg live weight, the carcasses scored and loin, biceps femoris, os femoris and phalanx prima IV were analysed for their nutrient (dry matter, protein, fat) or mineral (ash, Ca, P, Mg, Fe, Zn) composition. In contrast to the basal diet D, the CP or P reduction in diets B and C did not negatively affect growth, feed efficiency, nitrogen retention or overall carcass performances of the pigs. With the low CP diets B and C, N excretion via the urine was significantly reduced and thus N excretion per unit weight gain was decreased by about 30%. The addition of microbial phytase (C) increased apparent digestibility of P significantly between 25% (growth phase III) and 50% (growth phase II). In spite of 25% reduction of P intake (C), the absolute daily P retention did not differ between treatments. Thus phytase supplementation in diet C reduced P excretion per unit weight gain by about 35% (I, II) to 44% (III) as compared with A and B. Similarly, phytase raised apparent digestibility of Ca by about 25% and Zn by about 80%. Generally, the carcass and meat characteristics were not affected by any of the diet strategies employed in this experiment. Mineralization (bone weight, ash, Ca, P, Mg) of the os femoris and phalanx prima IV were also similar in all treatment groups. However, phytase supplementation led to significantly increased zinc concentration in bones, indicating considerably improved zinc release from the phytate complex. In contrast, Fe incorporation into the os femoris was significantly reduced in the phytase group. In general, the low CP and low P feeding regimen introduced in this experiment offers substantial benefits in maintaining a sustainable environmentally-friendly pork production.

AB This study was carried out to quantify the ground-water budget, calibrate aquifer characteristics and to predict the drawdown of the upper aquifer in the Hallabat-Khalidiya Wellfield in the eastern part of Jordan, for the next 25 years (the year 2025). There are two aquifers, the upper one composed of basalt and carbonates of the Upper Cretaceous age, while the lower one is composed of Lower Cretaceous Kurnub sandstones. The total annual recharge to the upper aquifer is modeled to be about 6 x 10(6) m(3) divided into inflow from Jebel El-Arab through the basalt being 4.5 x 10(6) m(3) and from the return irrigation flow and excess rainfall being 1.5 x 10(6) m(3). Leakage from the upper aquifer through the A(1)/A(6) aquitard to the sandstone aquifer is calculated to be about 0.5 x 10(6) m(3) which is about 8% of the total recharge to the upper aquifer, and outflow across the western boundary towards Wadi Zarqa reaches about 5.5 x 10(6) m(3). The maximum water level decline will reach 33 and 21.6 m, by the year 2025, due to abstraction of 16 x 10(6) and 8 x 10(6) m(3), respectively, and will reach 40 and 25 m for the same respective abstraction rate after correction. However, with 4 x 10(6) m(3) pumping, water levels will recover in most of the wellfield area and the small drawdown values (less than 10 cm year(-1)) in the intensive pumping area will be negligible. Therefore, the optimal use of ground-water resources should not exceed 6 x 10(6) m(3). (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

SO JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY

ID FOREST MANAGEMENT
AB Aim The United States (US) and other affluent countries consume vast quantities of global natural resources, but contribute proportionately less to the extraction of many raw materials. This imbalance is due, in part, to domestic policies intended to protect the environment. Ironically, developed nations are often better equipped to extract resources in an environmentally prudent manner than the major suppliers. Thus, although citizens of affluent countries may imagine that preservationist domestic policies are conserving resources and protecting nature, heavy consumption rates necessitate resource extraction elsewhere and oftentimes under weak environmental oversight. A major consequence of this 'illusion of natural resource preservation' is greater global environmental degradation than would arise if consumption were reduced and a large portion of production was shared by affluent countries. This paper considers some implications of the consumption, management and conservation of forests and wood at a local and global scale.
   Location We focus on Massachusetts, the eighth most forested state in the USA (by area), the third most densely populated, and an affluent region with consumption rates that are among the highest in the country.
   Methods Estimates of wood production and consumption are generated, and comparisons are made with other commonly used materials (e. g. steel, concrete, aluminium).
   Results A comparison of the feasibility and environmental impact of various strategies for dealing with rising wood demand suggests that the US should strive to: (1) reduce per capita consumption of wood and its substitutes, (2) recycle forest products more effectively, (3) protect extensive areas of intensively managed and unmanaged forests and (4) promote sound forest management where the environmental consequences are mild. Forestry and the sustainable generation of wood in Massachusetts would allow preservation of primary forests elsewhere in the world.
   Main conclusions When aggressive reductions in wood consumption and effective recycling are combined with judiciously increased harvest levels, 50% of the Massachusetts's wood consumption could be met at sustainable rates, even while preserving large undisturbed blocks of forest.

AB Organic wastes have been burned for reclamation. However, they have to be recycled and reused for industrial sustainable development. Carbonaceous materials were produced from coffee grounds by microwave treatment. There are many phenolic hydroxyl and carboxyl groups on the surface of carbonaceous materials. The base consumption of the carbonaceous materials was larger than that of the commercially activated carbon. The carbonaceous materials produced from coffee grounds were applied to the adsorbates for the removal of basic dyes (methylene blue and gentian violet) in wastewater. This result indicated that the adsorption of dyes depended upon the surface polar groups on the carbonaceous materials. Moreover, the Freundlich constants of isotherms for the adsorption of methylene blue and gentian violet onto the carbonaceous materials produced from coffee grounds were greater than those for adsorption onto activated carbon or ceramic activated carbon. The interaction was greatest between the surface or porosity of the carbonaceous materials and methylene blue and gentian violet. The microwave treatment would be useful for the carbonization of organic wastes to save energy. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

AB In this study, data from a random sample of Danish consumers are used to test the hypothesis that the emergence of a sustainable consumption pattern is influenced by individual value priorities. By the use of a cross-lagged panel design and structural equation modelling it is possible to draw firmer conclusions about the direction of causality than has been possible in previous research.

AB Environmental legislation is increasing the amounts of bought-in electricity required for sewage treatment, and generating larger volumes of sewage sludge to be treated and disposed of Concurrently, concerns over global warming and food safety from sewage sludge recycling on agricultural land is augmenting the costs of conventional sewage and sludge treatment technologies and practices. This paper reviews some emerging technologies and practices that may assist in mitigating these problems in the future. In addition, a number of potential renewable energy technologies available to water companies are reviewed. Results suggest that through the take-up of new technologies, current and future water quality standards could be delivered in a more sustainable way. However, this series of papers also highlights that institutional and political conflicts may have inadvertently failed to recognise the wider effects of improving water quality and lessened the financial support necessary for their widespread take-up. It is also suggested that through the use of a Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) approach, stakeholders could gain a better understanding of the broader environmental effects of achieving certain water quality standards and develop policy and long-term investment strategies accordingly. However, to fulfil the information requirements of an SEA, an appropriate appraisal tool that considers many of these factors in unison is required, and a possible technique is suggested.

AB The Florida Gap (Fl-Gap) project provides an assessment of the degree to which native animal species and natural communities are or are not represented in existing conservation lands. Those species and communities not adequately represented in areas being managed for native species constitute 'gaps' in the existing network of conservation lands. The United States Geological Survey Gap Analysis Program is a national effort and so, eventually, all 50 states will have completed it. The objective of Fl-Gap was to provide broad geographic information on the status of terrestrial vertebrates, butterflies, skippers and ants and their respective habitats to address the loss of biological diversity. To model the distributions and potential habitat of all terrestrial species of mammals, breeding birds, reptiles, amphibians, butterflies, skippers and ants in Florida, natural land cover was mapped to the level of dominant or co-dominant plant species. Land cover was classified from Landsat Thematic Mapper (I-M) satellite imagery and auxiliary data such as the national wetlands inventory (NWI), soils maps, aerial imagery, existing land use/land cover maps, and on-the-ground surveys. Wildlife distribution models were produced by identifying suitable habitat for each species within that species' range. Mammalian models also assessed a minimum critical area required for sustainability of the species' population. Wildlife species richness was summarized against land stewardship ranked by an area's mandates for conservation protection. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Maintenance wastes, if not managed properly, represent significant environmental issues for mining operations. Petroleum hydrocarbon liquid wastes were studied at an Australian site and a review of the literature and technology vendors was carried out to identify oil/water separation technologies. Treatment technologies and practices for managing oily wastewater, used across the broader mining industry in the Asia-Pacific region, were also identified. Key findings from the study were: (1) primary treatment is required to remove grease oil contamination and to protect secondary oily wastewater treatment systems from being overloaded; (2) selection of an effective secondary treatment system is dependent on influent oil droplet size and concentration, suspended solids concentration, flow rates (and their variability), environmental conditions, maintenance schedules and effectiveness, treatment targets and costs; and (3) oily wastewater treatment systems, based on mechanical separation, are favoured over those that are chemically based, as they simplify operational requirements. Source reduction, through housekeeping, equipment and reagent modifications, and segregation and/or consolidation of hydrocarbon waste streams, minimizes treatment costs, safety and environmental impact.

AB Diffusive samplers for monitoring of air quality are user-friendly devices that can normally be operated by the user himself. Hence these samplers are suitable for self-assessment. Practical and work organisational aspects of self-assessment of chemical exposure were studied in different occupational settings. It was found that the diffusive sampler used in these studies, the Perkin-Elmer tube in combination with thermal desorption, worked well for the purpose and could be correctly handled by the individuals using it. The results from self-assessments agreed well with expert measurements carried out by an occupational hygienist. However, in order to obtain a sustainable system of self-assessment strong organizational support is needed.

TI Water pricing towards sustainability of water resources: a case study in

   Beijing
AB The role of water pricing for managing water resources is widely recognized in many areas of the world because of the increasing scarcity of water resources, a high competition between water uses and environmental degradation. Based on the analysis of cost of water, this paper explores which types of cost should be reflected in the water pricing enhancing the sustainability of water resources. The principle of full cost pricing in which the cost should include supply cost, opportunity cost and externalities is proposed as a means to achieve the sustainability of water resources. In a case study of Beijing, low water price is analyzed as one reason for unsustainable water consumption. Thus water pricing justified is necessary and pressing. It is proposed to justify water price in phased manner and eventually towards full cost pricing. The assessment of impacts on water resources by raising water price shows water pricing could alleviate the conflict between water supply and demand. This paper concludes that water pricing can play an effective role in enhancing the sustainability of water resources in Beijing.

AB The Southern Forest Resource Assessment (SFRA) was initiated in spring 1999 to address broad questions concerning the status, trends, and likely future of southern forests. A descriptive assessment such as SFRA can be used to highlight the major dynamics and uncertainties at play within a region's forested ecosystems, thereby focusing public discourse. Because SFRA has only recently been completed, however, it is too early to examine its effectiveness as a basis for debate and policy. This summary describes five major forces of change affecting southern forests and then characterizes the trends in various forest conditions and their implications.

AB The South's forests are both important to and at the same time in the path of the region's growth. Research on social change for the Southern Forest Resource Assessment shows that rapid population growth and changing demographics are fueling growth of recreation demands and adding stresses on public and private forests. Concurrent with population and demand growth have been significant value and attitudinal changes among both land-owning and non-owning residents of the region. Southerners are clearly becoming greener. An opportunity to mitigate stresses on southern forests may lie in tapping Southerners growing environmentalism to form effective cooperatives involving public and private interests and forestry professionals.

AB Questions about the long-term sustainability of southern forest benefits, including wildlife habitat, water quality, and timber supply, prompted this regional assessment and guided the process by which it was conducted. SFRNs final report is descriptive-not prescriptive-and is intended to inform debate and policymaking in technically defensible, unbiased, and understandable terms. Although the analysis was science based and peer reviewed, the public helped frame the questions and critique the answers. This article describes the process used to complete the assessment and draws out several general observations about conducting a scientific analysis of this scope in a public setting.

AB The FUGI global model has been developed as a media of providing global information to the human society and finding out possibilities of policy coordination among countries in order to achieve sustainable development of the world economy under the constraints of changing global environment. The FUGI global model 9.0 M200 classifies the world into 200 countries/regions where each national/regional model is globally interdependent through international trade, export/import prices, financial flows, ODA, private foreign direct investment, exchange rates, stock market prices, and policy information, etc. The purpose of this article is twofold; the one is to introduce the outline of the FUGI global model 9.0 M200PC which might be expected to open a new frontier of economic science in the 21st century and the other is to make the baseline projections of the world economy during the period 2001-2010 as well as some policy scenario simulations using the FUGI global modeling system (FGMS). This modeling system is officially used by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) for the projections of the world economy and policy scenario simulations since 2000. The latest software of FGMS (FGMS200) for the Windows 98/2000/xp is also available. (C) 2002 Society for Policy Modeling. Published by Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

ID MANAGEMENT
AB A recent survey by ASCE showed a major need for rebuilding the critical components of the nation's aging infrastructure, such as roads and water-supply systems. To accomplish this major task, in addition to knowledge of basic civil engineering principles and techniques, future civil engineers need to be aware of the effects of planning, design, and construction on our environment. Specifically, a course needs to be developed for educating future civil engineers on concepts and techniques of protecting our natural resources, and planning for sustainable development and construction in an environmentally friendly manner. Specific topics can include modules on water resources and recycling in construction. The focus should be on teaching applications of new environmentally friendly concepts and techniques through case histories and real-world problems. Continuous evaluation of course content and methods of presentation should be made. The course should instill environmental awareness in the students' minds such that in the future, the environment is considered as much a part of any decision-making process in the practice of civil engineering, as are mathematics or the physical sciences.

TI Part of the problem or part of the solution? Social housing allocation
   policies and social exclusion in Britain
SO JOURNAL OF SOCIAL POLICY
LA English
DT Article
AB This article examines claims that social housing allocations policies can, on the one hand, contribute to and on the other, counter, social exclusion. In setting the scene, the paper investigates connections between housing processes and social exclusion and describes the development of social housing allocations systems over the past few decades. Drawing on evidence from two recently completed national studies in England and Scotland it shows that allocation policies contribute to social exclusion in three main ways. First, a large proportion of social landlords restrict eligibility for social housing thereby contributing directly to exclusion. Second, mechanisms within allocation systems continue to segregate the most excluded to the worst residential areas. Third, through the 1990s allocation policies became increasingly coercive, so reducing or eliminating tenant choice over their own housing in distinct contrast to the choice that is available in the private market. The paper then reviews the dilemmas faced by policy-makers: whilst aspects of allocations contribute to social exclusion at the individual level, they may be justified by their role in promoting sustainable residential communities. Although there are hopes that the 'choice-based' approaches to lettings which emerged in the late 1990s can both boost community sustainability and counter the disabling impact of coercive approaches, the article suggests it is unlikely that such methods can significantly enhance social inclusion as long as social housing remains a housing sector of last resort, with inbuilt disadvantages.

DT Article
AB The purpose of this paper is to explicate the current developments of rural traditional handicraft industries and structural changes in the handicraft villages of northern Vietnam. Rural industrialization is needed for creating job opportunities and increasing income of the abundant rural people as well as agricultural development, in Vietnam. For such rural industrialization, the Red River Delta, Kinh Bac, has the advantages of historically holding kinds of labor-intensive and unique traditional handicraft, business. Since the beginning of economic renovation in 1986, along with enlargement of market, some handicraft villages have quickly developed.
   In this paper, some positive and negative impacts of the development of traditional handicraft sector on the household economy, regional agriculture and rural society were analyzed by the result of field survey conducted in 1999.

TI Current state and trends in forest management in Cambodia
SO JOURNAL OF THE FACULTY OF AGRICULTURE KYUSHU UNIVERSITY
LA English
DT Article
AB While forest resources in Cambodia have been decreasing rapidly in the last few decades, a great. deal of attention is being given at present to the idea of community forests. This study tried to investigate the current change of forest management with a special reference to the present trends in community forestry development in Cambodia. Forest resources are a central part of livelihood of many local communities in Cambodia. The forest laws that came to be applied in the last few decades alienated local communities' rights to claim ownership of forests. This has resulted in a huge loss of forest resources and a poor national environment, threatening the subsistent livelihoods of the rural poor. The apparent growing interest in community forestry in Cambodia in the last decade has opened a new page of forest management. We are convinced that community forestry will become an integral part of sustainable forest management in Cambodia. While, at present, community forestry is still at the initial stage, there is a demand for more experiments and trials to test a variety of manifestation of the concept. In order to achieve a successful community forestry development, learning from both successes and failures of the current community forestry implementation is vital.

AB The short-term response of Mediterranean upper infralittoral macroalgal species to experimental human trampling was investigated. Disturbances of six different intensities were applied within the integral reserve of the Ustica Island marine protected area (Italy, Mediterranean Sea). The dominant macroalgal species Cystoseira brachicarpa v. balearica and Dicyota mediterranea were strongly affected by human trampling. Higher levels of disturbance significantly affected both algal percentage cover and canopy at an increasing rate. Three months after trampling, for both variables it was highlighted that the algal recovery from disturbance was incomplete, being significantly different among trampling intensities. The current study revealed that in the short-term it was not possible to identify critical levels of trampling that are sustainable for this shallow community.

ID NEIGHBORHOOD
AB Brownfields are abandoned or under-utilised sites with known or suspected environmental contamination. Public-sector efforts to promote brownfields redevelopment face a dual land-use policy challenge. On the one hand, government agencies must help reduce the barriers to private-sector reuse by addressing the uncertainties created by four major issues: legal liability for contamination; uncertain cleanup standards; availability of funding for redevelopment; and complicated regulatory requirements. On the other hand, brownfields reuse must be connected to wider community efforts to achieve environmental protection, central city revitalisation and reduced suburban sprawl. This involves tackling sustainable development and environmental justice issues: the marketability of brownfields; the social costs and benefits of developing greenfields versus redeveloping brownfields and meaningful community participation. This paper examines the progress by US local, state and federal agencies during the last decade in addressing this dual challenge. It is based on a review of the interdisciplinary brownfields literature, and evidence from Toledo, Ohio, whose experience promoting cleanup and reuse reflects that of many Midwestern and Northeastern cities.

AB Improved understandings of the agricultural and range ecologies of semi-arid Africa require better information on the spatiotemporal distribution of domestic livestock across agropastoral landscapes. An empirical GIS-based approach was developed for estimating distributions of herded livestock across three agropastoral territories ( around 100 km(2) each) over a two-year period. Algorithms developed from regression analyses of herd tracking data (with R(2)s greater than or equal to 0.67) are used to transform a more comprehensive but incomplete set of data generated from herders' accounts of their herds' grazing itineraries ( 400 herds following 6500 itineraries). The resulting characterization registers 40 000 days of livestock activities across 694 land units ( averaging 70 ha) over the study period. This study demonstrates that rural producers' knowledge of their daily extraction practices can be translated to fine-grained characterizations of extraction densities across mixed landscapes. The spatiotemporal distribution of livestock that is revealed by this approach diverges strongly from that predicted by commonly-used point-diffusion estimation procedures. Instead, the distribution reflects local patterns of land use, topography, vegetation, settlements, and water points. Grazing and nongrazing times spent in land units are not spatially correlated and the seasonality of grazing pressure is spatially variable. Therefore, the ecological impacts of livestock grazing are spatially variable at fine scales and there is a significant potential for livestock-mediated nutrient transfers across agropastoral landscapes. The georeferenced data produced by this approach not only will help evaluate the impact and sustainability of different management practices but also provides a strong empirical base for improved spatial modeling of herded livestock.

AB Fallow periods used in slash-and-burn agriculture in the Bragantina region, the oldest agricultural frontier in the Brazilian Amazon, are being reduced. The objective of this study was to analyze the effects of a shortened fallow period on the Bragantina landscape dynamics and equilibrium. Dynamics were characterized by landscape structural changes, particularly in the spatial distribution of secondary forests, and by transition matrix. Equilibrium was defined by temporal and spatial parameters, and by the increment of agricultural areas from 1985 to 1996, analyzed with 6 LANDSAT-TM images. I worked with 6 areas of 250 ha each, 3 with short fallow periods (2-4 years) and 3 with long fallow periods (about 10 years). Results showed that short fallow period areas did not present an equilibrium situation. In these areas, developed secondary vegetation tended to disappear and agricultural areas were being expanded at an average rate of 3% per year. Landscape structure changes pointed out that a reduction in fallow period was occurring in already short fallow period areas. Long fallow period areas presented a shifting mosaic steady-state condition, where punctual changes due to agricultural uses were compensated by field abandonment rate. Both agricultural uses and field abandonment rates were lower in long fallow period areas when compared with short ones. Comparisons with indigenous traditional cropping-fallow cycles indicate that sustainable conditions could be maintained with 11 years of fallow for each cropping year, while shorter cycles would break down the system if agricultural improvements are not implemented.

AB We classified NALC (North American Landscape Characterization) imagery to forest-nonforest and examined forest change between 1972 and 1992 in the Klamath-Siskiyou ecoregion ( USA) in relation to land ownership and fifth level watersheds. We also analyzed changes in forest patterns by land ownership for three major river basins within the ecoregion (Eel, Klamath, and Rogue) using FRAGSTATS. Overall, forests covered 66.8% of the ecoregion in 1972 and 62.1% in 1992. Approximately 10.5% of the forest area was disturbed overall, translating into an annual disturbance rate of 0.53%. Although public lands accounted for a slightly higher total area of forest disturbance, private lands were cut at a slightly higher rate. Forest disturbance within fifth level watersheds averaged 13.2%, but reached as high as 93.2%. For the three river basins where spatial pattern of forest disturbance was analyzed, private lands were already more fragmented than public lands in 1972. Over the 20-year time period, forest fragmentation increased on all ownerships. Fragmentation rates on public lands were high for all basins especially the Rogue. Clearcut logging on private lands was generally in larger adjacent tracts, whereas cuts on public lands were generally smaller and more dispersed. Our results illustrate the importance of considering landscape change history when planning for effective biodiversity conservation in forested ecoregions and when formulating ecologically sustainable forest management strategies.

TI Assessing global land requirement for surface copper mining
SO MINERAL RESOURCES ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
AB Most available LCA-tools and databases still lack reliable information on the extent of land used for processing and supplying raw materials like minerals I and metals. The amount of land disturbed by facilitating these resources which are of vital interest for the development of every modern society can be used as a key indicator for a number of sustainable development issues associated with a mining activity. In this work, a new methodical approach for estimating land requirement for surface copper mining operations is introduced. For the reference year 1998; facts and figures concerning global land requirement for surface copper mining operations are presented. The work closes with a short discussion and gives an outlook to forthcoming research.

SO MINERAL RESOURCES ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
AB The paper provides a strength, weakness, opportunity, threats and strategies (SWOTS) analysis of the current state of mining education. The paper is pointed at developing the mining courses in the future so that they become acceptable, attractive and sustainable to the students. It would nonetheless need a change in the outlook of the industry. It is also urged to remove the word "abandonment" from the mining lexicon.

AB Sustaining Earth, in the face of both technology thrusts and population dynamics, depends on our ability to maintain a delicate balance between human-promoted planetary modification and decline thresholds for land (soils), water, atmosphere, and biological systems. Mineralogy, as much as any other single science, will be central to this process. A set of links between Earth sustainability issues and the science of mineralogy are formulated and discussed in this discourse. The strongest ties exist in the areas of mineral-water and mineral-atmosphere interactions. Minerals are also particularly important in human disease generation. In addition, due to the role of minerals as invaluable economic resources, the environmental consequences of mining also come into play. New subdisciplines have recently emerged to bring mineralogy even closer to Earth sustainability issues, particularly mineral-microbe interaction science and nanomineralogy.

TI Roles and prospect of nuclear power in China's energy supply strategy
SO NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN
LA English
DT Article
AB China's annual energy demand is expected to amount to 3360 million tons of oil equivalent (toe) in 2050, the target year for the nation's economic development to reach the level of medium-developed countries in the middle of this century. The future energy supply, doubtless to go through a substantial increase and necessary mix shift with potential significant environmental impacts, will continue to rely on the domestic sources with coal-dominance but diversified mixes, in which nuclear power makes up a reasonable share. The large-scale development of nuclear energy is essential and promising, with the total installed capacity expectedly over 200-300 GW around 2050, and will be an effective response measure to mitigate the energy-derived environmental pollution and guarantee the national energy security. China is a developing country with the largest population in the world. The energy production had achieved remarkable progress over the last half century, particularly since the initiatives of reform and opening to the outside world in the late 1970s, and energy demand to fuel the continued socio-economic growth has been largely met. The current energy consumption of China is 896 Mtoe (China Stat. Abs. (2001) 130), accounting for about 11% of the world's total, the second largest energy consumer in the globe. However, the energy supply will face even tougher challenges in terms of demand increase, mix shift and potential environmental impacts to be posed by a sustained fast-growing economy in light of China's blueprint for future development. With the switch-over from the centrally planned economy to the socialist market economy and the gradual integration of China's energy trade into the international markets, the imported crude oil in 2000 amounted to 70.265 Mt (Int. Petrol. Econ. 9 (2002) 5), about 3.5% of the global petroleum trade, the long-term energy security for China would have great regional and global implications. It is, therefore, of great significance to make a deep study of the role and prospect of nuclear power as an essential component of China's future energy mix, so as to develop a sound and sustainable energy security strategy.

AB Since 1993 the Serengeti Regional Conservation Project (SRCP) in Tanzania has conducted a game cropping operation (the commercial utilization of wild animal populations in natural habitats) in areas immediately outside the Serengeti National Park in order to provide adjacent villages with incentives to abstain from illegal hunting. In this study we carry out a comparative economic analysis of the SRCP cropping operation and illegal hunting. The extent of illegal hunting was mapped by utilising questionnaires distributed to Village Game Scouts employed in five of the Project villages. Our research indicates that the cropping operation is not economically sustainable and makes only a minor economic contribution to the Project villages compared to illegal hunting. Furthermore, cropping quotas are small, utilization of quotas low, and the level of community involvement limited. Illegal hunting was extensive around both Project and other villages. We suggest that SRCP discard the inefficient cropping operation and instead concentrate on diversifying income opportunities for the Project villages.

AB Wildlife (bushmeat or game) is the primary source of protein for most poor households in tropical forests, and its consumption is resulting in unsustainable hunting of large animals, even in isolated regions. As a result, loss of fauna is often a more immediate and significant threat to the conservation of biological diversity in tropical forests than is deforestation. Although the potential effects of the extirpation from tropical forests of large, seed predating and seed dispersing wild animals is poorly understood, it is likely that there will be irrevocable changes in the structure and function of these ecosystems. We carried out a survey of 510 households of Tsimane' Amerindians in the rainforest of Bolivia to investigate how the prices of game and meat from domesticated animals affect the consumption of game. The results indicated that the price of fish and meat from livestock is positively correlated with consumption of wildlife, suggesting that policy makers may be able to reduce the unsustainable hunting of wildlife for food by reducing the price of fish and the price of meat from domesticated animals relative to that of wildlife. Increasing the production of livestock without causing environmental degradation will require long-term public investment in agricultural research and extension, and substitution of fish for game meat in the absence of sustainable management regimes will result in over-exploitation of riverine and lacustrine fish stocks.

ID PAIN
AB Extracts of the tubers of Harpagophytum procumberzs DC (Devil's Claw) are used widely for the relief of arthritis, lumbago and muscular pain. The anti-inflammatory activity has been attributed to their iridoid components. A two-step protocol was established for the in vitro propagation of plants of Harpagophytum sp. by the regeneration of new plantlets from nodal cuttings and their acclimatisation to ex vitro conditions. Single node cuttings were submitted to a root induction treatment with beta-indoleacetic acid (5 days at 2 mg l(-1)) followed by a transfer to a phytohormone-free medium to promote root elongation and support plantlet development. The new plantlets were weaned under autotrophic conditions and subsequently acclimatised in a glasshouse where they grew into fertile flowering plants that produced the characteristic Devil's Claw fruits as well as tuberised roots. Analysis of the tuber tissue of the micropropagated plants showed the presence of the iridoids harpagoside and harpagide at concentrations comparable with those found in the wild plant material (1% dry weight). The leaves were also found to contain these iridoids, and therefore could potentially provide an alternative and more sustainable source of therapeutically active compounds. The application of in vitro methods for the propagation of Devil's Claw would contribute to the conservation of this species.

AB We studied soil and forest floor conditions, regeneration patterns of trees, and forest structure and floristic composition along a gradient of dominance by Pinus spp. in disturbed stands in the highlands of Chiapas, southern Mexico. Seedlings, saplings, and adults of tree species were counted and measured in 2-3 circular plots (1000 m(2) each) in 36 forest stands (a total of 38 tree species). Dominance of broadleaved trees other than Quercus spp. was negatively correlated with basal area of Pinus spp. (P < 0.001). Soils of pine-dominated stands were more compacted, less acidic, and less fertile (lower C. E. C., nitrogen, and organic matter content). Numerous broadleaved trees may depend on an oak-dominated canopy to regenerate, and changes associated to pinelands expansion may compromise their long-term persistence. However, seedlings and saplings of Quercus spp. were abundant in stands with both an oak- or pine-dominated canopy. The results suggest that a plan for sustainable forest utilization in the study region, and in other similar populated tropical highlands, could take advantage of the abundant oak regeneration and coexistence with pines in the canopy.

ID PROPAGATION
AB Cimicifuga racemosa (L.) Nutt., also known as Black Cohosh, is among the top 10 selling medicinal herbs in the United States. The rhizomes have been used to relieve menopausal discomfort. This plant is wild crafted and conservationists have expressed concerns with the sustainability of C. racemosa. Excised tissues from young leaves of C. racemosa were cultured on Murashige and Skoog's medium (MS) supplemented with various concentrations of NAA and TDZ for production of callus. The optimum callus growth and maintenance was in 1.0 muM NAA plus 0.5 muM TDZ. Two-month-old calli were sub-cultured on different concentrations of cytokinins (BA, kinetin, 2ip, TDZ) or in combination with GA(3) for shoot induction. The rate of shoot induction and proliferation was higher in MS media supplemented with 2.0 or 4.0 muM of TDZ. Concentrations of TDZ greater than 4.0 muM suppressed shoot growth. Adding 3.5 muM of GA3 into media containing BA increased shoot growth. The presence of GA(3) with kinetin or TDZ did not affect shoot production. For rooting, shoots were transferred to MS medium with activated charcoal supplemented with various auxins (IAA, IBA and NAA), roots were noticed 20 days after transference. Activated charcoal was an essential component for vigorous rooting formation. Our results suggest that conservation of C. racemosa is possible through in vitro multiplication of leaf-derived callus.

DE Regional planning; Scenarios; Water resources; Water demand; Water

AB Sustainability-oriented water management calls for scenarios of future water use. Model-based qualitative-quantitative scenarios combine the development of story lines and the quantification of driving forces with the application of a water use model. In order to support regional planning in two semi-arid Brazilian states suffering from water scarcity, the water use model NoWUM was applied to derive two reference scenarios of municipality-specific sectorial water uses (irrigation, livestock, household, industry and tourism), and to assess the impact of certain interventions. Until 2025, the extension of irrigation accounts for almost 80% of the additional water withdrawals and for an even higher fraction of consumptive use in both scenarios. Domestic and industrial use increases in regions with high immigration, but water use intensities can be controlled by appropriate water pricing. A significant improvement of the developed scenarios is only possible if better data on water use and its driving forces become available.

AB The new English regional governance framework presents fresh opportunities to direct regional development in a more sustainable direction. However, for the North West region it is yet to be seen how these aspirations can be reconciled with the strong 'pro-growth' aims of the regional economic strategy. Within this context, the nature and findings of two interlinked projects which aimed to investigate and model regional development processes are presented. The first, 4-sight, is a resource flow audit for the promotion of sustainable resource management. Focusing on mineral flows, a mass balance methodology is used to facilitate a clearer connection between the use of resources and the generation of waste. Findings from 4-sight were then used in a second project, Atlas NW, involving the development of a digital atlas and future scenario model. Both projects make a useful contribution to the regional sustainability agenda through providing data and tools to underpin decision-making.

AB BURCH M. and GOMEZ R. (2002) The English regions and the European Union, Reg. Studies 36, 767-778. From the late 1980s on an elite-driven 'new regionalism' developed in the English regions, starting in the north. New region-wide modes of working by local authorities, business and other interests dovetailed with the new Government Offices to increase regional policy capacities. One of the focal points and drivers of this regionalism were the European Union (EU) Structural Funds. The Regional Development Agencies and Chambers/Assemblies established since 1997 have grown capacities and underpinned a higher profile information gathering and lobbying presence in Brussels. At the same time the focus has widened beyond the Structural Funds to reach into environmental policy/sustainable development and agriculture/rural development. The parallel strengthening of the Government Offices has enabled regional institutions better to address such cross-cutting issues, but has also reaffirmed Whitehall's dominant position and gatekeeper role.

AB Forest succession is a fundamental ecological phenomenon, which has significant implications for sustainable ecosystem management as well as biological, biophysical, and biogeochemical processes. Remote sensing is perhaps the only viable option for monitoring changes in forest ecosystems over large areas in a timely and cost efficient manner. This study investigates the spatial manifestation of forest succession in optical imagery through three types of models: a two-component spatial model, a canopy reflectance model (Geometric-Optical and Radiative Transfer, GORT) and a forest ecosystem dynamics model (ZELIG). The latter two models provide inputs to the former one to predict the spatial properties of images as a function of the combined effects of tree size and density, the spectral signatures of scene components and pixel size. An important source of information that is diagnostic of canopy structure has been identified: the spatial properties of multiresolution imagery. The sill of variograms of images of forest stands decrease with regularization, and in particular the rate of decrease is related to the size of trees. For stands with larger trees the sills of variograms decrease more slowly with increasing regularization than for stands with smaller trees. However, the spatial patterns for a scene with multiresolution imagery are also dependent on tree cover. This implies that the use of spatial patterns to estimate tree size will require independent estimates of tree cover as a preliminary step. Concept verification with an Ikonos 1-m panchromatic image for stands at the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest in the Cascade Range of Oregon indicates the simulated spatial patterns exist in multiresolution imagery. This study demonstrates the potential to map tree size automatically from multiresolution imagery. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Forest succession is a fundamental ecological process, which has significant implications for sustainable natural resource management as well as ecosystem biological, biophysical, and biogeochemical processes. Remote sensing is perhaps the only viable option to monitor succession in forest ecosystems over large areas in a timely and cost efficient manner. This study integrates the geometric-optical and radiative transfer (GORT) canopy reflectance model with the ZELIG forest ecosystem dynamics model to study the manifestation of forest succession in optical imagery. The spectral/temporal trajectories associated with forest succession are highly nonlinear. The rate of change in spectral space through time is faster during the early years of succession. The succession trajectories do not proceed linearly in the spectral space, but rather curvilinearly, and are strongly influenced by initial background/understory conditions and topography. The nonlinear nature of the trajectories implies that adequate characterization of forest development with remote sensing requires multiple images through time. Validation using multiple Landsat TM images for the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest (HJA) in the Cascade Range of Oregon found the expected successional trajectories in successfully regenerated young stands. The simulated effects of topography on successional trajectories exist in the Landsat data. The primary challenge in using multitemporal imagery to monitor forest succession is to minimize the effects of various kinds of noise, including varying atmospheric effects, phenology, changes in sun and viewing angles, and topography. The current linkage of GORT-ZELIG only captures the spectral/temporal changes for young stands. Successional changes associated with mature and old-growth stands due to changes in the materials comprising the canopy are not captured. Further research is necessary to include changes associated with mature and old-growth forests, and to develop operational algorithms to utilize information from multitemporal imagery to monitor forest succession.

AB This paper accounts for the contribution of the quantity and quality of schooling to worker productivity growth in the United States from 1870 to 2000. Schooling investments rose dramatically over the period before leveling off around 1970. Schooling likely caused 30 to 40 percent of the fivefold rise in worker productivity from 1870 to 1970 and produced a "wave pattern" in productivity growth (previously attributed solely to the timing and diffusion of important technological innovations). The results suggest that about I percent of the century-long 1.6-percent growth rate in worker productivity is sustainable. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

AB The present work has as objective to carry out a study of technological functionality of an intensive system of production of milk in the area of Humocaro, state Lara, being used the methodology; quick diagnosis of productive profiles and analysis of the technological functionality in production systems with bovine. The structural study locates to the property, as a specialized system of milk, being characterized to have: relationship enters milk meat 86:14; percentage of females 96%, I milk efficient of 242 cows / milker / day; manpower represents 20% of the total costs; capital of work 72%; The functional study indicated high acting technological, producing active pro, intensive handling of the flock, manpower efficiency in the I milk of 407 liters / milker / hour. The technological processes showed first floor waste levels until the age to the first childbirth; the production of milk, days of nursing and interval among childbirths, Indian animals outside of specifications for the order of the 15, 37, 30% respectively. Being confirmed the importance of to diagnose and to classify structural and functionally the production systems, to detect the variability, phenomenon that hides the waste, losses and human errors that commit the stability and sustainable of the system.

AB Recycled steel accounts for 46% of the iron resource of the steel industry in the world and has generated a new production route, based on the electric arc furnace, that produces 33% of the world steel output. Recycling is fully integrated in the market economy and has gained experience and technologies that allow 75% of the steel of end of life products to be effectively recycled. Furthermore, allowing for a modicum of cautions, this recycling is sustainable, which means that it may be repeated indefinitely, a feature that can be claimed by few materials. The use of scrap to produce steel requires 75% less energy than the integrated production route, that means 92% less energy than what is required to produce the same amount of aluminium. The electric arc furnace also allows the recycling of zinc, which is easily separated from the galvanized steel sheets used in construction and automotive industry. A large project federating the contributions of industry and academia, led by USINOR, has been carried out from 1995 to 2000 to support the sustainable recycling of steel : the main results of the "Cycle of Iron" are reported in this paper.

TI Sustainability when capital management has stochastic consequences
SO SOCIAL CHOICE AND WELFARE
LA English
DT Article
AB Sustainability is usually defined as a requirement of each generation to manage its stocks of man-made and natural capital such that the utility that it ensures itself can be shared by all future generations. Here we extend this definition to the case where capital management does not have deterministic consequences. A characterization is offered where the sustainability of one generation's behavior can be determined by comparing its utility with the utility of the succeeding generation, provided that the latter behaves in a sustainable manner. The properties of the definition are investigated and illustrated.

AB This paper presents the evaluation of a participatory research process used in a community-based heart health project, the British Columbia Heart Health Demonstration Project. The project utilized both a population heart health approach and a community mobilization model for taking action on heart health. A participatory evaluation plan was selected to: allow for participation in decision-making, incorporate the community perspective. enhance utilization of data, increase skills and capacities at the community level and enhance the responsiveness of the project team to emerging issues. Six elements common to participatory research were synthesized from the literature and rating scales were developed. Project participants across three project levels (investigative team, community project management committee members, community and provincial project coordinators) were asked to rate each of the elements and then explain their ratings during a focus group interview. Ratings were averaged and plotted on a 'sextagram' to illustrate the extent of participation in the research project. Patterns and themes that emerged from the transcripts and fieldnotes, regarding issues that influenced each rating. were categorized according to the framework of participatory research. Ratings and descriptions of participation on each element varied across project levels. The ratings of participation for the elements of sustainability and resource mobilization were uniformly low reflecting the large dependence on external funds. Participants involved at the community level perceived a greater level of participation in the identification of need and definition of goals and activities. Critical issues identified were related to the predominance of the external funding source, the imposition of funding agency guidelines on the communities, the amount of guidance by experts and the data collection methods. The analysis highlighted the responsiveness of the project to feedback over time and increases in the capacity of communities over time. Critical issues in the evaluation of participation were: differentiating stakeholder participation in program activities from research activities, variations in the meaning of community and participation among interviewees. the complexity of evaluating the extent of participation in a multi-level project and the evolution of participation over a 5 year time span. A definitive conclusion about the level of participation was elusive, however, the methodology afforded a contextual understanding of the assessments of participation and of participation itself and provides a foundation for evaluating and improving future participatory research initiatives.

AB In this paper we explore several themes based on our intertwined research and outreach activities. First, we examine and discuss emerging global food chains that are embedded in strategic alliances, joint ventures and relationships - in short in networks of power. Decisions are being displaced away from multiple actors situated in different localities to globalized decision-making located within a few firms that make up each cluster. While the roots of these phenomena are firmly grounded in long-term historical processes, it is important to document and understand what is emerging at the global level in order to create alternatives. Second, we discuss our outreach work with farmers, consumers and communities in helping them to frame and understand the changes that are taking place in the food and agriculture system. This is exemplified through a case study of the Kansas City Food Circle and its role in generating alternative visions from the consumption side of the food equation. This work is extremely important for challenging the global food system, and also for helping to empower farmers, eaters and communities to create alternatives. We lay out an analytical understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the global system, and the opportunities found in the social, environmental and economic failures of the global system. in conclusion, the work described above rests on the recognition of different forms of agency that are appearing in the food system, agency that is located within the spaces provided by the unsustainable, unjust nature of the global system. We remain cognizant of the incredible networks of power that shape the production and consumption relationships in the food system. However, we remain hopeful that models of emerging alternatives can help relocalize production/consumption relationships in the food system in equitable ways. In other words, in relationships that are personalized and sustainable, and that are embedded in place and community.

The transitions of natural resources from solid (coal) and liquid (oil) to gas (Liquified Natural Gas (LNG), Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG)) are closely related to not only the economy of mass production, storage and transportation but also environmental issues. Secondly, a brief discussion is given on "the 3E-Trilemma" which is the most important issue for the 21st century's civilization life. Thirdly, a new strategy for the renewable energy promotion-the so-called Fundamental Principle to promote New Energy Developments and Utilization-and its action planning for PV technology up to the year of 2010 are introduced. In the final part of this paper, a prospect of future industrializations of the photovoltaics is discussed, then the possible new roles to contribute to the global environmental issues by the PV system developments are introduced.

AB In a recent paper, Rouse and Daellenbach (1999) provide a five-step methodological approach which they feel will cure alleged inadequacies in empirical resource-based research. We suggest, however, that their methodology can provide only a useful aid for expanding our understanding of potential sustainable competitive advantages but will not allow researchers to effectively, verify those hypothesized advantages. Specifically, we argue that Rouse and Daellenbach's methodology is plagued by three major shortcomings: (1) it confuses the important distinction between knowing-how and knowing-what; (2) it fails to recognize the importance of observable variables in verifying the sources of sustainable competitive advantage; and (3) it calls for sampling on the dependent variable.

TI Implications of progressive title registration for cadastral information
   production case study of Namibia
SO SURVEY REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
AB Under the premise that land administration is one of the necessary components of sustainable development and better land management, this article reviews the effects of the implementation of a progressive titling approach on land administration components, such as cadastral acts and organisations, cadastral survey regulations and processes and cadastral databases. The study is largely based on the experiences of implementation of progressive titling in Namibia, where there are changes in both the legal acts governing titling as well as to cadastral survey acts and regulations. The article comes to the conclusion that the progressive titling approach as proposed for the Namibian context and its subsequent implications for cadastral information production shows that there is a need to rethink the structure and objective of cadastral surveying and a need to look for alternative models for cadastral information systems which support land administration.

AB This paper describes and analyzes critical conditions for achieving net benefit from opening the value-chain in mobile communications by introducing mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) in the Scandinavian and British markets. MVNOs are radio-less network operators that outsource the radio part and some other network elements to radio-based mobile network operators. The conclusion is that MVNOs offering complex bundles of innovative value-added services will probably not be competitively sustainable as separate firms, only as more tightly integrated partners of radio-based mobile network operators.

AB Experience shows that there is a close interrelationship between the successful disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration (DDR) of former combatants and the sustainability of peace-building processes. While drawing on lessons learned from recent DDR experiences elsewhere, this paper takes into account the contextual differences of Afghanistan. It explores the context of a future Afghan DDR process under three main subheadings: the need for reviewing the sequencing of the DDR process, the dilemma of whether former combatants should be given preferential treatment, and planning and co-ordination challenges for linking DDR with the overall peace-building process.

ID IODINE DEFICIENCY; HYPERTHYROIDISM; RADIOIODINE; THERAPY;
   STANDARDIZATION; RECOMMENDATIONS; MEDICINE; HEALTH; GOITER
AB To assess the economic effects of thyroid disorder-related morbidity in Germany, a systematic review of national and international literature from 1981-2001 was performed. Data from insurance companies, the government department of public health, and the federal office of statistics helped characterize the situation in Germany. Being the most important thyroid disease, endemic iodine-deficiency goiter causes economic costs of approximately 2.1 billion DM per year or 1 billion Euros (E) or 1 billion U.S. dollars. In recent years iodine supplementation of food became better accepted by the German population. This should significantly reduce the prevalence of goiter from 30%-40% to less than 10%. Functional thyroid disorders are observed in 5%-10% of the German population. A more differentiated view of these conditions should lead to specific guidelines for an economic screening and therapy of subpopulations. Lacking valuable data, an actual economic assessment of autoimmune or malignant thyroid diseases cannot be performed. On the other hand, with respect to the costs of specific thyroid therapy, e.g., radioiodine treatment of thyrotoxicosis (mainly toxic nodular goiter), the economic consequences of a new regulation for radiation protection in Germany have been demonstrated recently. Using the actual maximum permissible level of residual activity on discharge from the hospital after radioiodine therapy, length of hospitalization was shortened to 5.1 days in university hospitals and to 5.8 days in nonuniversity institutions. Payment per patient for radioiodine therapy was 1856 and 1530 E (median value) in university and nonuniversity hospitals, respectively. In conclusion, better prevention of iodine deficiency and its long-term consequences should effectively reduce direct as well as indirect costs and overall economic impact of endemic goiter as the most important thyroid disease in Germany. Sustainable elimination of iodine deficiency is technically possible, but it needs further commitment and support at all levels.

   CRETINISM; CHILDREN; AFRICA; OIL
AB Monitoring and evaluation are the last phases of a national iodine deficiency disorders (lDD) control program but among the most important. This paper summarizes the latest recommendations by the World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), and the International Council for Control of Iodine Deficiency Disorders (ICCIDD) about indicators and their normative values for monitoring the progress of IDD elimination and illustrates the successful monitoring programs in Switzerland and in China. Salt is the usual vehicle for iodine supplementation and quality control for iodine content can be assessed quantitatively by titration and qualitatively by simple test kits that can be used in the field. The most useful indicator of iodine nutrition is the median urinary iodine concentration. Thyroid size, especially by ultrasound, and neonatal thyrotropin (TSH) are also valuable. In Switzerland, access to iodized salt on a voluntary basis started in 1922. The initial level of iodization, 1.9-3.75 ppm iodine as potassium iodide (KI), was slowly increased to 15 ppm, and recently to 20 ppm, after careful epidemiologic and biologic monitoring. Elimination of IDD has been highly successful. The program costs US $0.07 U.S. dollars per year per person. In China, a national program of iodized salt (10-30 ppm) started in 1960 under the authority of the central government and rapidly expanded. National monitoring surveys have taken place every 2 years since 1993. Median urinary iodine, initially low, increased to 165 mug/L in 1995 and to 306 mug/L in 1999, prompting a decrease in the amount of iodine added to salt. The total goiter rate decreased to 20.4% in 1995 and to 8.8% in 1999. IDD can presently be considered as eliminated in China. Review of monitoring in the 128 other major countries affected by IDD shows extremely variable achievements, with evidence of IDD elimination in at least 18 additional countries. Some countries that were severely iodine deficient in the past are now exposed to iodine excess and risk its effects. Sustainable elimination of IDD is within reach and would constitute an unprecedented global success story in the field of noncommunicable diseases, but continuing vigorous action is required to attain this goal.

AB The importance of selective oxidation for the progress of green/sustainable chemistry is pointed out and the state of the art of heterogeneous selective oxidation of alkanes described, taking for examples the selective oxidations to form oxygenated products (1) of isobutane catalyzed by heteropoly-based mixed oxides and (2) of n-butane to maleic anhydride catalyzed by vanadium phosphorous mixed oxides. In addition, efforts necessary to bring about breakthroughs in this field are discussed.

TI Policy scenarios for achieving sustainable transportation in Europe
SO TRANSPORT REVIEWS
LA English
DT Article
AB The relationship between globalization and transport volumes is complex because of many causes. Rising incomes, more leisure time, new technologies and the ageing of the population are just a few examples of trends that will influence the future development of the transport sector in terms of both passenger and freight transport. This means that the future of the transport sector is characterized by uncertainty. The aim of this paper is to map out the possible impacts of current globalization trends on the European transport sector in terms of transport flows and carbon dioxide emissions by means of a novel multilayer assessment model. By applying a scenario approach and designing four contrasting development paths seen from a European perspective, the alternative futures of the sector are assessed in terms of transport volumes and emissions. The empirical findings appear to result almost everywhere in a (strong) growth of transport and emissions. Hence, the intriguing research question is now whether the introduction of specific environmentally benign policies in Europe could change this development. Consequently, the paper confronts the foreseen EU objectives with current policies, as creating sustainable mobility is a key element in EU transport policy. Our findings indicate, however, that the achievement of sustainable mobility is rather problematic. Effective policy implementation and (as yet uncertain) new technology developments may offer new opportunities to achieve a more balanced development of the transport sector. However, in most cases, only a combination of strict environmental policies (including transport policy) and a fundamental change of lifestyles in the mobile society is likely to lead to a decrease in carbon dioxide emissions in the next 20 years.

AB A long-term study was conducted between 1981 and 2001 in St Vincent, West Indies, and other short-term studies were conducted in the 1990s in the islands of Antigua, Barbados, and Trinidad, West Indies, to determine the major constraints to agricultural production and the influence of these constraints on the sustainability of agricultural diversification programmes in these islands. The results indicated that many of the constraints were common and included marketing, labour, pests and diseases, and praedial larceny. Agricultural information gathering was not a major problem and the main sources of information were the agricultural officers, the media, and other farmers. Agricultural diversification was not successful because it varied with the financial viability of the crops and how well the programmes were advertised and disseminated among the farmers.

AB This article examines the transition in Ireland over the last 15 years from a relatively unco-ordinated approach to pay determination to a co-ordinated approach linking pay policy into the broader context of national economic governance. The new political model of 'social partnership' was central to the remarkable experience of growth, employment expansion, and rising living standards in Ireland during the 1990s. This very success brought new challenges to the strategy of politically mediated pay pacts. The prospects for the sustainability of these new networks of economic governance are examined.

ID MODEL
AB Percolation loss of water in rice fields is a major factor of low water use efficiency of irrigated rice thus threatening its sustainability. The process of water percolation was studied in a puddled sandy loam rice field with three puddling intensities-no puddling (unpuddled), two passes of tractor-drawn cultivator + one planking (medium-puddling). and four passes of tractor-drawn cultivator + one planking (high-puddling), each at shallow (5-6 cm) and normal (10-12 cm) depths. Percolation losses of water decreased with medium-puddling by 54-58%, but it remained unaffected by increased puddling intensity and puddling depth. Percolation rate (PR) decreased with time with both medium- and high-puddling but it increased with increased depth of ponding water. The PR of water recorded in infiltration rings was 1.8, 38.8 and 42.1% less than that recorded in the whole plots thereby indicating the role of under-bund losses. Seepage ratio (ratio of seepage plus percolation to percolation alone) increased with increase in puddling intensity indicating that the magnitude of under-bund percolation was a direct function of puddling intensity. The hydraulic conductivity of the paddled layer decreased with increased puddling intensity (0.064 cm h(-1) with medium-puddling to 0.009 cm h(-1) with high-puddling) whereas the hydraulic gradient between puddled and unpuddled layers increased with increase in puddling intensity (0.84 cm cm(-1) with medium-puddling to 1.86 cm cm(-1) with high-puddling) (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Most cities in India have high air and noise pollution caused by transport vehicles, especially petrol/diesel-powered three-wheelers. An improved and electric cycle rickshaw can provide a non-polluting and silent transport system for urban and rural areas of India. It can also provide large-scale employment to millions of urban and rural poor. Nimbkar Agricultural Research Institute has developed two types of rickshaws - improved pedal cycle rickshaw and motor-assisted pedal cycle rickshaw - the details of which are given in this article. It is shown that these rickshaws can provide a safe, environment-friendly, energy-efficient and cost-effective transport system in cities and towns of India. Commercialization, technology, social and policy issues are discussed for large-scale introduction of these rickshaws.

AB In the long-term electrolysis Of CO2 with a metal electrode, it is very important to maintain the catalytic activity of the electrode. The Faradaic efficiency for the reduction Of CO2 On an Ag foil electrode is known to decrease rapidly several tens of minutes after the start of electrolysis, owing to the deposition of graphitic carbon, adsorbed organic intermediate or oxide/hydroxide acting as a catalytic poison. In order to settle this problem, the electrochemical reduction of CO2 on a net Ag electrode was here performed at the three-phase (gas \ solid \ liquid) interface where CO2 was supplied directly from the gas phase and a high concentration of CO2 was sustainable in the course of electrolysis. The conversion Of CO2 (initial volume 219 CM) with this electrode (11.8 cm(2)) was found to reach 60% at an electrolysis time of 5 h with the selective formation of CO. Furthermore, the addition of AgNO3 to the electrolyte resulted in a 100% conversion Of CO2. This was brought about by in situ formation of the silver crystal face providing a favorable reaction site for the CO2 reduction, and the Faradaic efficiency of H-2 was kept below 8% during the electrolysis.

AB Sustainability is increasingly recognized in political discussions as a comprehensive strategy for development processes. Attaining sustainable development requires a complete and balanced consideration of economical, ecological, quality-based and social aspects within a complex structural framework. The development targets to be attained must include micro- and macro-economical aspects as well as global features. The dynamics of development processes require constant critical investigation and adjustment to social demands and technical progress. Scientific contributions to sustainable development involve analyzing the actual situation and outlining paths of development and their perspectives.
   Sustainable development in the field of plant production is based on a site-specific and efficient use of all production factors: It is not just intended to optimize the sustainable objectives within the production process. Influences on the pre- and post-production area also need to be evaluated. Sugarbeet is particularly well-suited to the development of sustainable cultivation concepts because the production and processing of raw beet material are closely linked.

AB Under the title,Perspectives for Germany: Our Strategy for Sustainable Development", the German government has defined its sustainability strategy. The report makes clear that sustainability is a concept embracing all spheres of policy and life. Agricultural and consumer policies are therefore part of the sustainability strategy. Triggered by the BSE crisis, both areas of policy, which overlap in many ways, have acquired new importance in public and political discussions. In addition to food safety, the concept of quality is on trial. The term "quality" is increasingly used not only in the sense of product quality, but also encompasses production processes, careful resource management as well as protection of the environment and of animals. This presents the food industry with new challenges.

DT Article
DE sustainable plant protection; EU harmonizing; agricultural turn-around
AB New developments in plant protection legislation are conditioned by the shift in competence within the European Commission and, in particular, the assignment to food safety. Even more in the future than in the past, plant protection will have to be guided by the demands of public health and environmental policies. On the other hand, agricultural concerns recede into the background. Direct effects emanate from the obsolete agents programme which already by the end of 2003 will markedly reduce the range of agents in the European Union and cut their number to about half by 2008. The market participants are responsible for ensuring the availability of the necessary plant protection agents.
   In Germany, new developments arise for the practical farming out of the harmonization of the licensing of plant protection agents, the separation of risk assessment and risk management in the licensing procedure, as well as national legislation, such as the federal nature protection law. Discussions about the future direction of plant protection strategy with a large number of civil associations have shown that, in addition to greater transparency and better communication, the primary objective should be to ensure adequate possibilities of control in order to guarantee lasting plant protection.

AB A model which describes the interaction of ryegrass and clover when grown together is proposed and analysed. The main biological feature of interest is the fixation of nitrogen by clover which is then subsequently used by ryegrass. In view of the difficulty of obtaining reliable data for the nitrogen level, this is modelled by a distributed differential-delay system. This enables a smaller set of variables and parameters to be used and the thresholds for sudden changes of outcomes with parameter values to be determined and related to the underlying biological processes. The dynamical system behaviour is extremely diverse. largely because of the effect of the distributed delay. Monocultures, coexisting mixtures, and limit cycle behaviour are possible long-term attracting outcomes. Numerical simulations of the model reveal that often two of these outcomes are possible for a given set of parameter values and which one is preferred depends on the initial conditions. The biological basis of the paper is proposed and then the model is analysed, Simulations and response outcomes are given for various values of the distributed delay. These indicate that this is a realistic model with an interpretable link to the underlying processes. The basis of the model is easily generalised to multiple-species models with seasonal variation or other externally-driven inputs. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Pharmaceuticals and vaccines made by genetic engineering are well accepted all over the world. In contrast, there are many people, particularly in Europe, who are worried that food, made by the same new technology, may harm their health or cause damage to the environment. This is despite the growing evidence that genetically modified crops have the potential to improve world food security and the fact that there have, as yet, been no adverse results of their use in the food chain. Because of these worries and the mechanisms of politics, agricultural biotechnology has become the target of concerns about food safety (BSE, Foot & Mouth Disease), along with globalisation and the power of multinational companies. These concerns will, hopefully, be overcome by a more open and well-informed dialogue between scientists, opinion leaders, educators and the public. If judiciously applied, genetically modified crops will help increase sustainability and the fight against hunger in the world. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The last decade has seen an increasing number of biosafety related publications focusing on transgenic organisms. Recent extensive field studies suggest that harmful laboratory effects on non-target organisms rarely occur in the environment. Moreover, biosafety studies typically show no difference in hybridisation between genetically modified plants (GMPs) or non-GMPs and related wild species. Since risk is a product of both exposure and hazard, biosafety research should clearly not only target gene flow exposure but specifically concentrate on expected hazards emerging from successful transgene flow to wild relatives of GMPs. Generally, transgenic plants behave in an ecologically similar manner to non-GMPs if the modified trait confers a neutral advantage under environmental or experimental conditions. However, GMPs perform better than non-GMPs if the new phenotype is challenged by conditions ecologically advantageous for the modified trait. Since biosafety research is a laborious process it will have to concentrate resources on thoughtful, thorough experiments, and target ecologically 'riskier' organisms. So far, we have no evidence that the use of GMPs contradicts sustainable agriculture and nature conservation per se. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V All rights reserved.

AB Membrane bioreactors (MBRs) have been used increasingly for municipal wastewater treatment. The current wastewater treatment plants are designed to treat three times the average flow in dry weather (DWF) which covers the expected range,of incoming flow rates. If throughput in MBRs can be changed readily by changing the energy input into the system, a smaller plant can be designed. Under varying throughput operation, a high aeration rate is required to generate a high crossflow velocity to minimize fouling. At low flow rates, a low aeration rate is used to minimize energy consumption. The aim of this work is to explore the feasibility of designing smaller membrane plants by varying the throughput. This requires the control of membrane fouling, so that chemical cleaning is not compromised. Fouling is controlled by limiting the membrane flux and also by flushing the surface of the membranes with large air bubbles. Variations of the permeate flux and the aeration rate were varied in this study and their effect on controlling fouling noted. Intermittent permeation while retaining aeration was found to be an effective technique for long-term sustainability of high fluxes.

AB To meet the goals of sustainability and to enable industrial ecology, green chemistry and engineering needs to be studied from a life-cycle perspective. When designed correctly, green chemistry and engineering can affect multiple stages of the life cycle of a product or process. Successful implementations of green chemistry and engineering research are improving the environmental impacts of chemical products and processes in every stage of the life cycle while also offering economic incentives. Analysis of new and existing green chemistry and engineering technologies with quantitative and qualitative metrics can identify and quantify these benefits. The examples presented illustrate the principles of life-cycle assessment as applied to green chemistry and engineering.

AB Background: Antibiotics are frequently prescribed for older adults who reside in long-term care facilities. A substantial proportion of antibiotic use in this setting is inappropriate. Antibiotics are often prescribed for asymptomatic bacteriuria, a condition for which randomized trials of antibiotic therapy indicate no benefit and in fact harm. This proposal describes a randomized trial of diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms to reduce the use of antibiotics in residents of long-term care facilities.
   Methods: In this on-going study, 22 nursing homes have been randomized to either use of algorithms (11 nursing homes) or to usual practise ( 11 nursing homes). The algorithms describe signs and symptoms for which it would be appropriate to send urine cultures or to prescribe antibiotics. The algorithms are introduced by inservicing nursing staff and by conducting one-on-one sessions for physicians using case-scenarios. The primary outcome of the study is courses of antibiotics per 1000 resident days. Secondary outcomes include urine cultures sent and antibiotic courses for urinary indications. Focus groups and semi-structured interviews with key informants will be used to assess the process of implementation and to identify key factors for sustainability.

AB Thioureido-acetamides (1) are quantitatively accessible by gas-solid reaction of amines with thiohydantoins. They are useful starting materials for various heterocyclic syntheses in one-pot cascade reactions with excellent atom economy: 2-iminothiazoles (5) are quantitatively formed from 1 and phenacyl bromide in the solid state. Thioparabanic acids (9) are easily accessible from oxalyl dichloride and 1. Benzils react with 1 to afford functionalized 5,5-diaryl-thiohydantoins (14) and dimethylacetylene dicarboxylate gives 2-imino-5-methylene-thiazolidine-4-ones (17) and (18) upon reaction with 1. The one-pot syntheses of imidazo[1,2-c]pyrimidines (25) and (28) from 1 with benzaldehydes and ethyl cyanoacetate or malodinitrile are benign new accesses to these important heterocycles. All product structures are determined from spectroscopic and chemical data and preferred tautomers are judged by DFT calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G* level. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

DE laboratory; primary health care; quality assurance; developing countries
AB Laboratory services are an essential component of health care delivery in tropical countries and play a vital role in improving the accuracy of clinical diagnosis and the investigation of disease outbreaks. In developing countries, laboratories face numerous constraints to providing quality services, including poor selection of techniques, difficulties in equipment availability and maintenance, and shortages of supplies, staffing and supervision. Currently in the eastern African countries (Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda), internal quality control procedures are inconsistently carried out in most laboratories. National External Quality Assessment Schemes (EQAS) have been established in all countries addressing a limited number of tests, but are constrained by difficulties of sustainability and poor coverage. The Laboratory Programme of the African Medical and Research Foundation (AMREF) has been operating a simple EQAS for primary heath care laboratories since 1993. Tests addressed are those carried out in primary health care laboratories in eastern Africa. A total of 81 laboratories from 5 countries in the eastern African region have participated in the scheme since 1993 and 9 distributions were submitted since the start of the scheme. No laboratory participated in all distributions; 24 (30%) laboratories participated in 4 or more distributions. Of these, the hospital laboratories in Kenya and Tanzania showed improved average mean scores between the first two and subsequent distributions. The educational benefit of participation in the scheme is emphasised. There was an overall low rate of participation of laboratories (35%) once the scheme was expanded to include laboratories outside direct AMREF project activities. Contributing factors include shortages of staff and lack of time in busy rural laboratories, together with difficulties in communication; however, the voluntary nature and lack of appreciation of the benefits of participation may also play a role. To increase participation in the scheme and to address the quality of laboratory services throughout the region, AMREF is currently developing a Regional EQAS in collaboration with the Ministries of Health of Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda, in affiliation with the World Health Organisation (WHO). The approaches used to establish reference values for haemoglobin samples are discussed. The scheme has also been utilised to examine the performance of different techniques for haemoglobin estimation, demonstrating the inaccuracy of the visual comparator methods.

AB Red soils cover 21% of China's surface: some 2.10(6) km(2). Much of the area is hilly. Rice grows mainly in the lowlands. Only a fraction of the uplands in the red soil area is cropped, but yields are low due to inadequate topsoil as a result of erosion and nutrient mining. The remainder is wasteland that is not used for cropping and a little for grazing. But these areas have a high agricultural production potential if some constraints are removed. The World Bank has set up a major project named "China Red Soil II". It comprises a total area of over 9.10(4) ha for development or rehabilitation, with 215 small watersheds including one named Qingshishan.
   Techniques of system analysis and optimization are applied to this watershed, and a watershed development planning model (QINGS) has been created. QINGS includes seven objectives, 32 activities and some constraints. two scenarios; three land use forms and two irrigation systems are available to the model for selection. This complexity provides a web of possibilities and there can be many solutions for suitable development. By running QINGS a number of times for successively more specific goals, a window of opportunities is established where land use practice is the key factor to development and where all goals are met to a certain degree. Feasible solutions can then be identified in which reduction of soil erosion, increased income and sustainability in land use are combined. Local farmers and technical officers can identify and accept the best compromise. QINGS is it tool for watershed developers that allows them to quantify opportunities and constraints, and set specific targets for developments with the local population. Results of QINGS can empower local farmers in negotiations with watershed developers.
   After 5 years of red soil development supported by the World Bank Project. various activities were initiated, including new crops (e.g. bamboo), trees (e.g. mulberry), livestock, fish and pearl production, and an ecological and social benefit forest, Infrastructure was improved (such as irrigation system, traffic conduction, biogas ponds and so on), The year 2000 total net income is 870.000 yuan. compared with 265.000 in 1994 before the project, Before the projects the forest cover rate was 9% nook it is up to 50% soil erosion is at low level and water supply has increased the length of the secure growing season by more than 50 days. The social employment conduction is also improved. especially the employment of rural women, The whole structure of agro-ecology system is optimized. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Contour hedgerow systems consisting of various combinations of tree and grass species can be used on sloping lands to minimize erosion, restore fertility, and improve crop productivity, but there is need to evaluate the effectiveness of each system for its suitability at any locality as effective erosion control. The objectives of this study were to determine the amount of soil conserved by contour calliandra (Calliandra calothyrsus)-Napier grass (Pennisetum purpureum) hedgerows, and then develop a support practice P-subfactor for conservation planning in central Kenya. As a benefit beyond soil conservation, biomass yield and N and P retention by the hedgerows were determined. Cumulative data for five cropping seasons from 1997 to 1999 indicated that the contour hedges on 20% slope conserved more soil (168 Mg ha(-1)) than on the 40% slope (146 Mg ha(-1)) compared to the control plots. For both slopes, this was equivalent to a 0.7 P-subfactor for use by the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) model in predicting soil erosion. The N and P losses between the hedges and control were statistically significant only on the 20% slope (P = 0.05). Combined biomass yield from the calliandra-Napier grass hedges were 12 and 9 Mg ha(-1) per year and 40% slopes, respectively. This soil conservation technology may be used by small-scale farmers that use mixed fanning systems in the highlands of central Kenya and similar ecoregions as a step towards sustainable farming.

AB Winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) monoculture is common in wheat-growing areas of the Loess Plateau of northwest China. This system is characterized by nearly 3-month summer fallow from wheat harvest at the end of June or early July to sowing in late September. It not only lowers the overall precipitation-use efficiency because of the large amount of evaporation from the bare soil surface during the fallow period but also entails high risk of erosion by summer rainstorms. There is a need to develop more effective cropping systems to replace the current production system. Seven alternative rotations, mainly using wheat, rapeseed, corn, potato, pearl millet, linseed, alfalfa and sweetclover, were established and their use of environmental resources, production performance, energy efficiency, soil fertility sustainability, and soil conservation effectiveness were compared with continuous wheat cropping. The rotations had greater potential use of environmental resources. Despite showing no clear advantage in grain yields, all rotations were significantly higher in total above-ground biomass production and more efficient in energy transformation compared with continuous wheat cropping. After a 3-year cycle, the rotations did not adversely affect soil bulk density but some rotations significantly increased soil water-stable aggregates compared with the initial measurement. For the rotations based on the inclusion of legumes, the availability of N was apparently improved but the total P was substantially reduced compared with the initial measurement and continuous wheat cropping. An assessment of soil conservation effectiveness with a weighted soil conservation effectiveness index (WSCEI) indicated that the rotations performed much better than continuous wheat cropping in conserving soil and water resources. This study also strongly recommend that it is feasible to cultivate winter wheat followed by a 3-month legume fallow crop in year I and then a summer crop cultivation in the next. This system provides a soil cover during both erosion-prone rainy periods while leaving the soil bare for about 7 months (October-April) every 2 years. Another alternative is to cultivate winter wheat followed by a 15-month legume crop cultivation in years I and 2 and then a summer crop in year 3. This system allows the soil to be covered during three rainy periods while leaving the soil bare for about 7 months every 3 years. As most of this 7-month period is winter with low rainfall (snow) and temperatures below 0degreesC, not only is soil evaporation very low but the risk of erosion is also low.

AB Sole-cropped, unfertilized maize is the dominant cropping system throughout southern Africa. Yields have become stagnant and legumes are frequently advocated as an affordable option for resource poor farmers, to enhance productivity. Farmer participatory research was employed to test legume intensification as a means to improve maize-based systems in Malawi. A range of,options were evaluated, from grain/legume intercrops of. long-duration pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan) and groundnut (Arachis hypogaea) rotated with maize (Zea mays), to a relay green manure system of maize with Tephrosia vogelii (Fishbean). Two years of on-farm experimentation indicated that under on-farm conditions legume-intensified systems produced residues that contained about 50 kg N/ha per year, two-fold higher than sole-cropped maize residues. Grain yields from legume-intensified systems were comparable to yields from continuous sole maize, even in a dry lakeshore ecology. These preliminary findings were linked to farmer assessment, where farmers participating in the trials expressed strong interest in the technologies. Yet the probability of adoption remains uncertain. Associated surveys outlined constraints and trade-offs underlying technology choice, information that is not usually considered in conjunction with on-farm trials. Although the legumes were highly productive, farmers expressed worries about the marginal loss of maize production. While the trial performance was similar across regions, differences in market condition, farm resources and household composition appears to stimulate different technology choices. Farmers weigh the benefits of weed suppression and potential cash earnings, against the costs of seed, problems of seed access, labor requirements and problems of grain market access and price. Surveyed farmers commonly manage residues by burning. Promotion and experimentation with more efficient use of legume residues may offer higher short-term impacts than efforts to promote adoption of another cash crop. Ultimately, adoption and soil fertility benefits may depend on market returns to legume production. This study documents the value of researchers and farmers partnering in evaluation of technologies, adoption constraints and competing technology choices. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Developing strategies that foster sustainable land management in the hillsides of Central America poses a particular challenge. This research provides empirical and qualitative evidence regarding the impact of local farmers' land management decisions on the sustainability of land use, in conjunction with the specific environmental context. A set of indicators suitable for evaluating impacts in a mixed land use, steeply-sloped catchment in a rural setting in Central Honduras was selected. In the first phase of the study, measured attributes indicating the leakiness of, or tendency for water and sediment to be redistributed within or away from a given site were used to assess the impact of movement of sediment, water and nutrients among patches within the landscape. At any given site, one or two factors contributed to overall leakiness, but with no consistent pattern. Patterns of land use are not strictly related to particular landforms in the catchment. The frequency, intensity and location of transfer processes responsible for the movement of sediment and water were evaluated in the second phase, and the most influential processes identified. Both natural and anthropogenic factors of the study influenced the movement of sediment and water, which varied throughout the catchment. At the broadest scale, surface water flow, landslides and slope failure, and land use change affect overall catchment integrity, threatening sustainability in some cases. Overall, the study successfully linked management produces to landscape features and transfer processes, established patterns of degradation, and identified, cases where the combination of anthropogenic and natural factors has resulted in unsustainable land use. In all cases, the scale of observation determined the dominant factors. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

A pilot study was made in Adwa district (Tigray) with the objective of evaluating the factors related to environmental degradation,and assessing the effects of agricultural activities on the natural resources. Environmental data, a digital terrain model, vegetation, geomorphological, and erosion maps of the study area were integrated with socio-economic variables using a geographical information system (GIS). The classification of the data used in the integration, and the information extracted using the GIS gave three main groups of Tabias and four main groups of variables. The relationship among the Tabias (smallest administrative units), groups of Tabias and environmental variables were quantified using various statistical, multivariate numerical methods and fuzzy set analysis. The application of fuzzy set theory showed that each group of Tabia, recognized as a rural subsystem (RS) was associated with a group of variables. Analysis of variance showed that the three RSs were significantly different in most of the environmental variables considered. Human and livestock population densities, geomorphology, altitude and some natural and anthropogenic vegetation types were highly discriminatory. Percentage cover of evergreen scrub, bushlands and severe badlands are considered key indicators of the scale of environmental degradation. Results of the canonical correlation analysis (CCA) indicated that human pressure had more impact on the physiognomy of the vegetation than on its floristic composition. The Evergreen scrub vegetation type appeared to be expanding with increasing human influence signifying a decrease in biomass of vegetation as a result of collecting wood for fuel and other domestic uses. Bushland appeared to be expanding with the same trend. Woodland, which was abundant in one of the RSs, is considered to be the natural physiognomic vegetation type in the area and efforts to maintain it and/or recover it elsewhere in the study area are recommended. Food production in the area did not match population growth. The expected crop yield under good soil and rainfall conditions was low by any standard. The per capita energy obtained from the grain harvested in the farm plots ranged from 428 to 4347 cal per person per day (the average is far below the basic minimum required for mere subsistence) suggesting that there is a need for substantial supplementary income from off-farm activities and/or other sources. This study indicated that regional and site specific approaches and interaction with the people at all stages of the research, program development and implementation are required for sustainable rehabilitation.

AB Research to integrate the vast array of information needed by producers to make decisions allowing them to remain sustainable in our ever-changing agricultural environment is in its infancy. Present research has not provided crop production and soils information that is adequately comprehensive and holistic for producers to make critical decisions. We propose a dynamic cropping systems approach to help producers make those critical decisions they need to remain sustainable. Our definition of a dynamic cropping system is a long-term strategy of annual crop sequencing that optimizes crop and soil use options and the attainment of production, economic, and resource conservation goals by using sound ecological management principles. Implicit to this strategy is the need for producers to possess information necessary to respond to continual change. Key factors associated with dynamic cropping systems are diversity, adaptability, reduced input cost, multiple enterprise systems, and awareness of environment and information. Development of a dynamic cropping systems research program involves creating a crop portfolio, crop sequence evaluation, and multidirectional flow of information among research, extension, and producers. Dynamic cropping systems approach relies on responsiveness and provides producers with management flexibility for developing their own long-term sustainable crop, soil, and. land use systems.

ID SUSTAINABILITY
AB This paper makes three points relevant to the application of the precautionary principle to the regulation of GMOs. i) The unavoidable arbitrariness in the application of the precautionary principle reflects a deeper epistemological problem affecting scientific analyses of sustainability. This requires understanding the difference between the concepts of "risk", "uncertainty" and "ignorance". ii) When dealing with evolutionary processes it is impossible to ban uncertainty and ignorance from scientific models. Hence, traditional risk analysis (probability distributions and exact numerical models) becomes powerless. Other forms of scientific knowledge (general principles or metaphors) may be useful alternatives. iii) The existence of ecological hazards per se should not be used as a reason to stop innovations altogether. However, the precautionary principle entails that scientists move away from the concept of "substantive rationality" (trying to indicate to society optimal solutions) to that of "procedural rationality" (trying to help society to find "satisficing" solutions).

AB Understanding the distribution of grazing activity and its management is valuable to ensure the sustainability and productivity of heterogeneous grasslands. Controlled behavioural studies can provide insight into the cognitive abilities of herbivores and suggest new approaches to improve their grazing distribution. We compared the behaviour and diet selection of sheep and cattle in 1-ha fescue (Festuca arundinacea S.) plots, in which the number and size of preferred ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) patches were varied. Five different patterns were used to investigate the effects of ryegrass abundance and spatial distribution on the searching success of the herbivores. Both heifers and ewes grazed ryegrass more when its abundance increased from 1.5 to 6%, and also when ryegrass was aggregated into a few 8 x 9-m patches, rather than being dispersed into a larger number of 3 x 3-m ones. Neither the interaction between ryegrass abundance and patch size, nor that between herbivore species and patch size was significant. At 6% abundance, aggregating ryegrass into a single 24 x 24-m patch tended to further increase its use by heifers, but not by ewes. Fescue less than 1 meter from the nearest ryegrass patch was usually selected more than the fescue located further away. Fescue between 1 and 5 m from the nearest patch was never selected more than the fescue located further away. Our results, together with those for the diet selected by sheep, cattle and deer, when offered patches of a preferred food in aggregated or dispersed patterns, indicate that over a wide range of abundance, it is advantageous for herbivores to forage on patchy resources when the preferred vegetation is aggregated. This corroborates the prediction that foraging costs associated with patch distribution are involved in determining diet selection in patchy grasslands, but our results suggest that it is also influenced by some social characteristics of the animals, such as their social attraction and social tolerance.

AB This is a thermodynamic analysis of the Province of Ravenna (Italy) and its districts (Ravenna, Faenza and Lugo) and an evaluation of entropy waste production based on a balance sheet of greenhouse gases. The method used is emergy analysis(1,2). The results show that the Province and Ravenna are characterized by a heavy exploitation of local non renewable resources, Faenza strikes a good balance between economic development and environment conservation and Lugo is less sustainable than the others. The greenhouse gas balance shows that the Province emits 10.5 times the quantity of greenhouse gases that it adsorbs and that the emissions reduction is required in the energy sector, which is responsible for 92% of the total.

AB Currently there are three main parallel processes aiming either to improve the environment or to achieve sustainable development within the European Union (EU): the 6(th) Environmental Action Programme (6(th) EAP), the Cardiff Process and the Strategy for Sustainable Development (SDS). The 6(th) EAP provides key environmental objectives and the framework to set other environmental strategies. The Cardiff Process plays a fundamental role in the progression of environmental integration, as an essential tool to implement the EAP and to achieve sustainable development. Sustainable development is a major political mandate for the EU and the SDS aims to provide long-term objectives and measures to promote and implement it. The EU Chemicals policy is an example of a European policy extracting and using some new approaches and principles characterising the political processes described above. The aim of this paper is to analyse these political processes, their reciprocal interactions, highlight their innovative approaches, as well as providing concrete example of sectoral policy implementing them.

AB The Earth is an open thermodynamic system, that remains in a steady state far from the equilibrium, through energy and matter exchanges with the surrounding environment. These natural constraints, which prevent the system from maximizing its entropy, are threatened by human action and our ecosystem needs urgent protection. In this viewpoint the environmental certification was born, according to international standards ISO 14001, ISO 14040, and European Regulation EMAS.(1-3) These are voluntary adhesions to a program of environmental protection by companies, administrations and organizations which, starting from the respect of the existing environmental laws and regulations, decide to further improve their environmental performance. To obtain and maintain certification of a system is necessary to apply some indicators to evaluate its environmental performance and to demonstrate its progressive improvement. Here we propose to use for this purpose the thermodynamic indicators produced from emergy analysis by Odum.(4,5) The case study is Montalcino city (Italy) and emergy indicators are used to evaluate environmental performance of this system where exist different activities, from agricultural productions, to tourism. Results show that emergy analysis could become a valid standard monitoring method for environmental certification, especially in consideration of its wide application field.

AB A highly reproducible, low resource requiring disease severity bioassay for testing suppression of Pythium damping-off in sugar beet caused by Pythium ultimum in soil is described. Changing of soil characteristics and the native microflora are avoided and standardization of the assay is carried out by testing infested soils on evenly germinating plants growing in an inert medium. The disease suppressiveness of the test soils is compared to standard, conducive soil, and quantified by calculation of symptoms on the hypocotyls. The reliability of the assay was investigated in nine well characterised organically or conventionally managed soils. In the standard, conducive soil it was clearly demonstrated that disease expression is correlated with available nutrient supply (oatmeal). Addition of oospores to the test soil had no effect on disease severity and the role of inoculum level is discussed. There was a clear tendency for low clay content to result in higher disease suppression. Partial sterilisation of the selected soils by gamma-irradiation and steaming at 54 C indicated that suppression was of microbial origin. Although texture may play a role in suppressiveness no clear effect, related to any management practice, was found. Tests on 64 soils confirmed that sandy soils tend to be more suppressive than clayey soils. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB 1. Under the Endangered Species Act, the National Marine Fisheries Service has authority to protect listed species from any adverse actions that may jeopardize the population's ability to recover and increase to sustainable levels. Listed salmon species in the northwest United States are known to travel through urban areas in their migration from river to ocean. Species such as the chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) often spend several weeks in these urban estuaries where they can be highly exposed to urban-related contaminants that reside in the sediments and accumulate in their prey species. The concern is that these contaminants are bioaccumulated to levels that may impact the ability of individual salmon to grow and mature normally. This paper provides a framework for determining the tissue and sediment concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) that are likely protective against adverse effects in listed salmonid species.
   2. The relevant ecotoxicological literature was examined. and 15 studies were selected that met the pre-established criteria outlined here. For each study, the lowest tissue concentration (residue) of total PCBs associated with a biological response was selected. The tissue concentration associated with the 10th percentile of these 15 studies was chosen to represent the residue effect threshold (RET) above which wild juvenile salmonids would be expected to exhibit adverse sublethal effects from accumulated PCBs. This value (2.4 mug PCBs g(-1) lipid) is expressed in terms of the lipid-normalized concentration because of the large effect lipid can have on the expressed toxicity and the substantial variability in lipid content observed in salmonids over their life cycle.
   3. A sediment concentration that is expected to produce the RET was then determined using the biota-sediment accumulation factor approach. The sediment effect threshold, which varies with the total organic carbon content in sediment, is the level above which adverse effects may be expected in juvenile salmonids due to accumulation of PCBs from environmental exposure. Bioaccumulation of PCBs was examined in one river system as a model for determining an appropriate bioaccumulation factor for wild juvenile chinook salmon.
   4. Evaluation of exposure to potentially deleterious concentrations of PCBs based on tissue residues is the preferred approach; however, the sediment effect threshold may also be used in cases where bioaccumulation has been characterized in an estuary. The threshold values presented here are intended as interim guidelines that should be modified as more data become available. Additionally, because of the uncertainty around many of the factors and assumptions that comprise the single threshold effect values, it is recommended that future studies be employed to help determine a range of acceptable values that would afford protection under various environmental and biological conditions.

AB 1. Under the US Endangered Species Act and the Essential Fish Habitat provisions of the Sustainable Fisheries Act, it is the responsibility of the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) to safeguard the health of fish in estuarine and coastal waters.
   2. This includes assessment of the impacts of exposure to toxic chemicals on fish and their critical habitat.
   3. This analysis was conducted to assist NMFS resource managers in determining when fish are exposed to potentially harmful concentrations of one of the most common environmental contaminants, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs).
   4. Effects thresholds were estimated primarily through segmented regression of site-specific sediment PAH concentrations and associated disease prevalences in a resident fish species, English sole, Pleuronectes vetulus.
   5. The analyses and supporting data encompass several endpoints, including DNA damage, liver lesions, and impacts on growth and reproduction.
   6. In general, liver lesion prevalences, DNA adduct levels, and impacts on growth and reproduction were minimal at sediment PAH concentrations at or below 1000 ppb. Above 1000 ppb, there appears to be a substantial increase in the risk of contaminant-related injury to English sole. Published in 2002 by John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

TI Sustainable development for Canada's Arctic and Subarctic communities: A
   backcasting approach to Churchill, Manitoba

AB Backcasting has been used to evaluate sustainable development in several communities in Canada, Europe, and the United States, but no research has applied it to a remote northern community. This first such effort, which took place in Churchill, Manitoba, evaluated the environmental, social, and economic aspects of a small Subarctic community. As part of the backcasting approach, a community survey identified local issues and concerns, such as tundra vehicle damage, alcohol abuse, and the future economic viability of the Hudson Bay Port Company. Community residents also identified potential growth areas, including the establishment of Nunavut and increased tourism opportunities. The application of the backcasting approach in Canada's northern regions will have benefits for research and management by identifying local issues and building strategies for sustainable development.

AB In managing urban stream channels there are pressures to use soft engineering techniques to restore channels wherever possible, to undertake management within a drainage basin context, to produce sustainable solutions and to consider community views. However, specific methods for characterizing the channel network in terms of possible management options have not been developed explicitly for urban areas. A method of characterizing the entire drainage network of urban areas, based upon segmentation of the stream channel network according to the incidence of road crossings and stormwater outfalls, is proposed together with consideration of ways in which the segments can be characterized, including stream channel hazards as a means of providing one basis for urban channel management.

ID CONSERVATION; ECONOMICS
AB This paper discusses generally why humans should bother to conserve sea turtles. In doing so, it considers both economic and non-economic reasons and outlines threats to the existence of sea turtles and ways in which tourism may either contribute to the conservation or decline of their populations. Turtle-based ecotourism at Mon Repos in southern Queensland is described. As a result of a survey conducted by the authors, it is shown that turtle-based ecotourism at Mon Repos has positive social (indirect) consequences for the conservation of sea turtles. Furthermore, it is argued that ecotourism operations at Mon Repos have positive direct impacts on the sustainability of populations of sea turtles. However, using a simple model, it is emphasised that this impact is limited because turtles are migratory. A model is also developed to capture the possible relationship between turtle populations and the sustainability of ecotourism dependent on turtle populations, and is extended to other wildlife species. Significant interdependence exists between the sustainability of these two variables. The theory is related to Ciriacy-Wantrup's social safe minimum conservation standard for species' survival.

AB In natural protected areas, ecotourism could provide the impetus and economic investment for improved conservation of species and habitats. However, few studies have attempted to characterise sustainable ecotourism and positive examples of ecotourism are still rare. This study conducted a series of interviews at the local, regional, and national level in order to identify general feeling and concerns of government and non-government institutions with respect to ecotourism. Questionnaires were used to assess the extent of fulfillment of ecotourism principles by tour operators in protected areas of La Paz Bay. Government and non-government institutions interviewed expected ecotourism to be a means for regional development, a conservation strategy and compatible with conservation activities. Ecotourism operators surveyed were more likely to be considered ecotourism ventures, reaching on average 10 indicators (sigma approximate to 3, n = 14), and were found to be providing, in some way, benefits to the conservation of the area. Current ecotourism activities may provide benefits for conservation, but are not comparable to the costs involved in the conservation of the protected areas concerned. Hence, current ecotourism activities have not met the expectations of the protected area managers. The role that ecotourism can play as a conservation strategy depends on the strategies designed by protected area managers to take tour operators to share the costs and benefits of environmental services.

AB Common reed is increasingly harvested from the Mediterranean region to provide thatching material to north European countries. The impact of these management practices on the fauna is poorly known. The aim of this study was to quantify the effect of reed cutting in the Mediterranean region through a comparative analysis of water regime, vegetation structure, arthropod distribution and passerine assemblage at cut and uncut reedbeds in southern France. Cut reedbeds were characterised by a lower salinity, higher water level in spring, and higher reed biomass than uncut reedbeds. Arthropod distribution differed consistently between cut and uncut sites, leading to a higher index of food available to passerines in cut reedbeds. Cut reedbeds had a similar bird species richness but a lower bird abundance, due to the significant decrease in Moustached Warblers and Bearded Tits at cut sites. The mild Mediterranean winter favoured early growth of reed in spring, making harvested reedbeds suitable for breeding of long-distance migrants such as the Great Reed Warbler and Reed Warbler. However, for the resident species that breed earlier in the season, cut reedbeds presumably lack sufficient vegetation cover to provide adequate nesting and feeding sites. Although biennial cutting (double wale) is considered as a good compromise between conservation and commercial interests in the UK, the juxtaposition of annually cut and never cut reed patches appears as the only sustainable alternative for the Mediterranean region. We further hypothesise that an optimal mosaic design of cut/uncut reed patches could provide as high a conservation value as unmanaged reedbeds.

TI New Labour, social justice and children: Political calculation and the
   deserving-undeserving schism
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF SOCIAL WORK
LA English
DT Article
AB Within a context of national prosperity and relative economic strength, poverty and inequality is rife in the UK. This paper considers the broad contours of such social injustice, before sharpening the focus to examine the specificities of child poverty. The New Labour government has made an 'historic pledge' to end child poverty within a generation. The paper traces the key policy initiatives that are being directed to this end and, by drawing on the latest research evidence, it attempts to assess their early impact. Whilst it is acknowledged that the government's social justice agenda has made some progress in 'tackling' child poverty, it is further proposed that a more rigorous redistributive approach is required if substantial and sustainable improvements are to be made. Furthermore, it is argued that the social justice agenda is conditioned by wider political calculations, which limit its scope. In this way the imperative to be seen to be 'tough on crime' has meant that policy responses to children in trouble have taken a. distinctive and increasingly punitive form. By developing the argument that New Labour's electoral ambitions have led it to re-engage with a specious 'deserving' 'undeserving' conceptual dichotomy, the paper assesses the implications for the treatment of child 'offenders' in particular, and the broader social justice project more generally.

AB Although assessment models exist for evaluating buildings after they are designed, the problem is creating an appropriate tool for the design team to use during the design process to create sustainable (green) buildings. An integrated, life-cycle-oriented design tool (LEGOE) is proposed and its general criteria identified for use in practice including the scope of methods as well as their scalability over the manufacture, construction, use, cleaning, maintenance, refurbishment and recycling/waste cycles of the building and its components. The design tool is compared with assessment tools for green buildings. The integration of basic methods of life-cycle analysis (LCA), in particular energy and massflow analysis, into the normal practice environment (CAAD, specification and quantity surveying, energy need and building physics calculation, comfort and health risk appreciation) is considered. Feedback from the initial practical applications of the integrated tool is discussed. Conclusions concern the time-span for the development and diffusion of new integrated tools in the planning, design and specification processes.

TI Environmental Performance Evaluation (EPE) for construction
SO BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION

DE construction; environmental performance evaluation; sustainability;
   environmental management systems; Hong Kong
AB Environmental management system (EMS) has been advocated for all economic sectors. Construction, as one of the pollution generators, is not exempt from EMS. However, in performing EMS, the greatest obstacle is the lack of objective performance evaluation criteria. ISO 14000 is an international environmental management system (EMS), which deals with the management of the organizational environmental performance. In 1999, ISO 14031 Environmental Performance Evaluation (EPE) was introduced for assessing the environmental performance related to the management and operational systems. The Hong Kong construction industry lags behind other sectors of the economy in implementing EMS and EPE because the self-initiating nature of the scheme lacks any external stimulus. The high initial cost of the scheme deters contractors from the implementation. However, the application of EPE offers many benefits to the Hong Kong construction industry. Therefore, this paper discusses the benefits and difficulties when implementing EPE in the construction industry. Some obstacles have been identified and suggestions to overcome them are made.

AB Housing associations can perform maintenance and improvement in a professional, client-centred and sustainable manner by deriving the technical management from the strategic stock policy. However, utility and maintenance performance levels of housing complexes can be adjusted to suit the target user groups. The implementation of mutable performance levels in planned maintenance requires the standardization of conditions, performance loss and defects of maintenance cost components. By adopting a condition-dependent approach to maintenance, housing associations can exercise control over the desired maintenance performance levels and costs. Pilot studies were carried out by five Dutch housing associations to model the strategic technical management process.

AB The North American population is approximately 80% urbanized and spends almost 90% of the time indoors. Accordingly, the built environment is the most important - one might almost say "natural" - human environment. Urban settlements incorporate within their boundaries natural ecosystems of plant and animal life (often highly adapted to the urban environment), and are in turn incorporated within wider bioregions and global ecosystems. But urban settlements are not just built and natural physical environments, they are social, economic, cultural and political environments; the whole constitutes an urban ecosystem. These ecosystems have profound implications for the physical, mental, social, emotional and spiritual well-being of their human inhabitants, as well as for human beings remote from these urban ecosystems. Therefore, this paper discusses urban ecosystems and human health and presents a framework for indicators of environmental health in the urban setting based on such an understanding. The concepts of environmental viability, ecological sustainability, urban livability, community conviviality, social equity, and economic adequacy are discussed in relation to human health and are used to organize proposed candidate indicators for urban ecosystems and public health.

AB This paper gives a broad overview of issues relevant to the development and use of health-and-environment indicators in the broader context of sustainable development. Criteria for the construction of indicators are given, and their key characteristics are highlighted. Selected international indicator initiatives are discussed, as well as the concept and use of core indicators in policy and planning. Finally, an organizational framework for the consideration of health-environment-development linkages is presented, which can be used in the development of health-and-environment indicators in various contexts. This framework is the Driving forces-Pressures-State-Exposures-Health Effects-Actions framework (DPSEEA) of the World Health Organization (WHO). It is a descriptive representation of the way in which various driving forces generate pressures which affect the state of the environment, and ultimately human health through the various exposure pathways by which people come into contact with the environment. Throughout the paper, emphasis is placed on work done within the UN system, in particular that of the WHO, and examples of suites of indicators developed and in use are provided.

AB Background: Thirty percent of patients with esophageal cancer have malignant involvement of the major airways, leading to respiratory distress and life-threatening major airway obstruction. Tracheobronchial stenting has been reported to be effective in providing sustained relief from obstruction.
   Methods: We conducted a chart review of all patients with advanced inoperable esophageal cancer who had malignant tracheobronchial obstruction requiring rigid bronchoscopy and airway stenting at our institution between June 1998 and July 2001. Outcome measures, which included survival, efficacy, and complications, were recorded.
   Results: There were 11 patients (4 women) with a mean age of 61 years. Five patients had distant metastases at the time they underwent rigid bronchoscopy. Four patients who required mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure were successfully weaned off mechanical ventilation after the stenting procedure. All patients with dyspnea had immediate relief of respiratory symptoms, which was sustained for seven patients (64%). The mean duration of survival was 61 days. Two patients required repeat procedures, one for stent dislodgment on extubation and the other for stent migration.
   Conclusion: Stenting in patients with malignant tracheobronchial obstructions due to advanced esophageal cancer achieves immediate, dramatic, and sustainable relief in respiratory symptoms, conferring a survival benefit in patients whose conditions are otherwise deemed to be terminal.

DT Article
DE Minqin basin; man-land system; man-land relationship; oasis
AB Human beings have had a tremendous impact on natural ecosystems and are now the principal power to change the biosphere. It is logical that we should pay close attention to the interaction between human systems and environmental systems. Taking Minqin basin, Gansu Province, as a ease, this paper focuses on the evolution of regional physical environments and the cultural systems by which people maintain their relationships with those environments. This paper presents the conceptual framework for the man-land system. Expecting to accelerate the regional sustainable development, it also analyses the evolutionary mechanism of regional man-land system. On the basis of reviewing and analyzing the evolution of man-land system in Minqin basin, the paper also brings forward an adjusting mode for the studied area, which consists of three aspects: to build up a concept that economic growth must harmonize with environmental quality's and land productivity's improvement; to make a whole planning and management in the drainage area; and to push forward the technique of water-saving irrigation and establish water-saving agricultural system. It's meaningful for resource exploitation and sustainable development of Chinese northwestern arid area, which is represented by Minqin basin, by understanding what great changes the basin has experienced and is experiencing at the global background, and studying its time order and territorial structure, the system's character and law of evolution, trend and the regulating ways to improve man-land relationship.

AB Daqing is a mining city that was set up on wetland by exploiting and processing petroleum. This paper points out that net-group urban system is the optimization mode for Daqing urban spatial structure through analyzing and appraising the present situation, characteristics, advantages and disadvantages of Daqing spatial structure. And the best way of optimizing Daqing urban spatial structure is to adopt sustainable development strategy, establish the coordinated grade structure of urban system, construct developed towns net system, prefect the function structure of the towns at all levels, make full use of resources and strengthen environmental protection. Spatial structure of Daqing must be accordingly adjusted in order to adapt to the transformation of future economy types and functions. Based on the foundation of keeping net group, the development should be from disperse to moderate centralization in order to give prominence to the multi-function of the central city. Constructing ruralizing city should be the future goal of Daqing City.

AB As the economic, political and cultural center of a nation or a region, cities are the carriers of human activities. In a sense, only cities take the path of the coordinated sustainable development, it is possible for a country or a region, even the whole world, to develop coordinately and sustainbly. Today, how to describe the urban sustainable developing level and measure the coordinated degree of environment, economy and society, has attracted more and more attentions of urban managers and researchers. City is assumed to be a big system composed by 3 subsystems of environment, economy and society, a set of indicators for urban coordinated sustainable development of Taiyuan have been designed according to the thought of coordinated sustainable development and the reality of Taiyuan development. In this indicator set there are three levels, which can be called as target level, indicator level and statistic indicator level. Among them, target level includes three high-generalized grade-1 indicators, representing the development standard of economy, society and environment subsystems. In this paper, according to the ideas of system theory and QIAN Xue-sen's theory of meta-synthesis methodology from qualitative analysis to quantitative analysis, the level, the sustainable degree and the coordinated degree of urban development were set up, which described the urban coordinated sustainable development scientifically and quantitatively. The above indicator system and the method of quantitative description were applied to Taiyuan. Through calculating, we have got the economic developing level, social developing level, environmental quality situation and the overall developing level, of Taiyuan from 1986 to 1995. Also, we worked out the sustainability of the whole development, the respective coordinatabilities of the subsystems of economy and society, society and environment, and environment and economy, and the coordinatability of the overall development of Tuiyuan in the same period of time. The coordinated sustainable development situation was quantitatively described, and the low development level was comprehensively analyzed, and suggestions were raised for its future coordinated sustainable development.

AB Grande Cache Coal (GCC), an investor-owned Alberta company, is in the final stages of the regulatory process leading to the resumption of coal mining in the Smoky River Coal Field of Alberta. Although many opportunities for low-cost, high-yield mining remained on the property, GCC opted for a long-term production plan that ensures stability for the local economy, sustainable use of the resources in the area, environmental responsibility and a satisfactory return for its investors.
   GCC entered the Alberta coal approval process in late 2000 with a public disclosure document. In October 200 1, GCC formally submitted an application for mining approval and an environmental impact assessment (EIA) to the government and the public. The application covered the proposed Grande Cache Coal project, which includes the No. 7 underground mine, No. 8 surface mine and coal processing operations. The EIA provided a comprehensive investigation of environmental sensitivities in the project area, matched with environmental protection programs. The project is based on commencement of operations in late 2002.
   GCC's plans are founded on a commitment to sustainable development and has framed this commitment in the context of a long-range mine development plan that will sustain the community of Grande Cache over the next 25 years. The Grande Cache coalfields offer extensive coal reserves and opportunities, for both surface and underground mining. Combining highly productive U.S.-style room-and-pillar underground mining methods and conventional truck-and-shovel open pit mining, GCC's approach to sustainable development encompasses community involvement and reclamation of mine sites to productive land uses after mining.

AB In this paper we argue that the discussion on how to get to an equitable global climate change regime requires a long-term context. Some key dimensions of this discussion are responsibility, capability and development needs. Each of these, separately or in combination, has been used in designing schemes for differentiation of commitments to limit or reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Many implementation problems of these proposals are often side-stepped. In particular, some proposals may be incompatible with Article 2 of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), i.e. they are unlikely to keep the option open of long-term stabilisation of atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations at relatively low levels. We present some evidence that shifting the emphasis from emission reduction to sustainable development needs can contribute significantly to relieving the threat of human-induced climate change.

AB Background: Intensive glycemic control substantially reduces the microvascular and macrovascular complications of type 2 diabetes mellitus, although less than half of patients with diabetes achieve the target glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA(1c)) value recommended by the American Diabetes Association. Because monotherapy with an oral agent does not address the multiple pathophysiologic defects of diabetes, use of combination therapy appears to be warranted. A previous 32-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial found that treatment with glyburide/metformin tablets was associated with greater reductions in HbA(1c) values compared with glyburide monotherapy, metformin monotherapy, and placebo.
   Objectives: This study evaluated the durability of efficacy and long-term safety profile of therapy with glyburide/metformin tablets over 52 weeks.
   Methods: Patients enrolled in this open-label extension study were drawn from 3 groups: those who completed the 32-week double-blind study, those who were discontinued from the double-blind study, and those who were ineligible for the double-blind study and were enrolled directly in the open-label extension study. Patients with an HbA(1c) of <9% received glyburide/metformin 1.25 mg/250 mg tablets BID, and those with an HbA(1c) of greater than or equal to9% received glyburide/metformin 2.5 mg/500 mg tablets BID. Primary efficacy variables included changes from baseline in HbA(1c) fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and body weight at week 52. Safety was assessed based on adverse-event data and the results of physical examinations and laboratory tests.
   Results: A total of 828 patients were enrolled in the study: 515 who completed the 32-week double-blind study, 138 who were discontinued from the double-blind study, and 175 who were directly enrolled. At week 52, the mean HbA(1c) value for the entire population had decreased from a baseline value of 8.73% to 7.04% (95% CI, -1.81 to -1.58). Patients who were enrolled directly had the poorest glycemic control at baseline and experienced the greatest reduction in HbA(1c) (-3.35%; 95% CI, -3.61 to -3.10). A reduction in mean FPG for the total population was observed as early as week 2, from 201 to 141 mg/dL (95% CI, -63.0 to -55.7). Symptoms of hypoglycemia occurred in 19.9% (165/828) of patients, although only one third of these patients had a documented finger-stick blood glucose value of less than or equal to50 mg/dL.
   Conclusions: In this 52-week, open-label extension study, glyburide/metformin tablets were well tolerated and effective in patients with type 2 diabetes. They provided rapid and sustainable reductions in HbA(1c) values and FPG concentrations.

ID LITERACY
AB The role of the professor in community service writing courses factors into the teaching, research, and overall institutional viability of these initiatives, yet too little has been written about the role of the professor in service learning. Through an analysis of recent publications on service learning and data gathered during an outreach initiative at University of California, Berkeley, this article reveals a few of the obstacles that hinder the sustainability of community literacy programs. I find that professors in service learning courses can better sustain these initiatives when they view the community site as a place where their research, teaching, and service contribute to a community's self-defined needs and students' learning.

AB Among European transition economies and the CIS, Russia is the largest country and has the most important endowment of natural resources, well-educated labour force, and large potential market. Paradoxically, Russia is one of the least attractive host countries in this region. This situation may generate a risk of economic marginalization. Our main task is to develop our understanding of FDI in Russia by asking a main question: Why is Russia an exception in the context of FDI globalization? Is Russia willing to stay outside the general trend of fierce competition for FDI and able to developed endogenously sustainable growth? (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Left turn on green? The unintended consequences of international funding
   for sustainable development in Brazil
SO COMPARATIVE POLITICAL STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
ID NONGOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS; NGOS
AB This article presents the first attempt to examine the political consequences of internationally funded programs that target local nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). Although the purported mission of NGOs is often economic, humanitarian, or environmental, the authors suggest that their impact is also profoundly political. Injections of international resources into underdeveloped, often clientelistic societies can fundamentally change the nature of the local political arena, affecting access to economic resources, social benefits, and ultimately the quality of democratic representation, The authors analyze the impact external resources have on politics by examining a series of World Bank-funded projects based in the Brazilian Amazon from 1995 to 1997, They show that World Bank funding designed to channel resources to local groups had powerful effects in the political arena, increasing electoral support for the Left in the 1998 presidential race. This article has important implications for the growing role of NGOs and their influence on politics in the developing world.

AB Transuranics management concerns all NPP types, because of the specifications for a sustainable development. Multiple recycling is mandatory. Neutronic abundance can be obtained in fast spectrum, or by adding external neutrons or (temporarily) with additional U-235. The LWRs can control the plutonium inventory and significantly reduce the amount of transuranics transferred to the geological repository, thanks to the use of innovative nuclear fuel in a limited part of the NPP fleet. HTR adapted to transuranics burning can help. In the future, in addition to the liquid metal FBR, a strategy based on a gas cooled technological line and advanced fuel opens a second path towards fast spectra. Strategies for defining the optimal mix of reactor types in the nuclear fleet at a given time and demonstrating the fuel cycle flexibility are under study.

AB Plutonium recycling offers benefits in an energy perspective of sustainable development, and, moreover it contributes to non-proliferation. Prior to recycling, reactor-grade plutonium from light-water reactors does not lend itself easily to the assembly of explosive nuclear devices; thereafter, practically not at all. Control systems for material security and non-proliferation should identify and adopt several categories of plutonium covering various isotopic mixtures associated with different fuel types, in order to better reflect the risks and to better focus their controls. The author proposes the adoption of three categories of plutonium. (C) 2002 Academie des sciences/Editions scientifiques et medicales Elsevier SAS.

TI Radical actions by radical farmers - Regional revitalization in the
   Okitama Basin of Yamagata Prefecture
SO CRITICAL ASIAN STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
AB This report describes the ways in which a group of organic farmers in Yamagata Prefecture have been able to effect basic structural changes that contribute to the social transformative process of counter-hegemony. Members of the Okitama Farmers' League (OFL) have initiated a regional revitalization plan based on the concept of eco-circularity in which local household food wastes and other organic materials are converted into compost for use by area organic farmers. By forming organic farmers' collectives, members provide farm-related work in rural areas during the long winter months. The women farmers in the group have formed a support group for farm wives to fight collectively against female subordination within the household as well as to improve the overall position of women in the Okitama area. They are challenging the dominant culture's values and social assumptions, and are engaged in creating new cultural values and definitions of self in relation to others. The OFL offers a vision of a noneconomistic, democratized, and environmentally sustainable society centered on universal principles of human rights, social justice, and popular participation in the reformulation of the meanings attached to work, authority, culture, family, community, gender, and consumption.

AB General practitioners (GPs) and increasingly other medical practitioners are well placed to address alcohol and other drug (AOD) problems. Their involvement in this area of care, however, is assessed to be less than optimal. There is, however, a growing body of evidence for the potential efficacy of medical practitioner intervention at the primary care, emergency department and in-patient level. There is also considerably expanded scope to operate from an evidence-based perspective. However, key questions arise regarding what constitutes best practice in the translation of the growing AOD knowledge base into clinical practice behaviours. This paper explores possible contributory factors to the low level of engagement with AOD issues by GPs and examines a wide range of individual, structural and systemic issues that may be amenable to change. Strategies for the dissemination of research findings, changing professional practice behaviour and introducing sustainable structural reforms are also addressed.

AB This paper provides a perspective on the potential of Chinese ecological agriculture to address sustainable human-environmental interactions. As Chinese agriculture is increasingly challenged by the constraints of population, resources and environment emerging from its modern development, it is imperative to explore a sustainable agricultural paradigm that could accommodate economic and socio-cultural needs within an already stressed natural resource base. The rise of ecological agriculture is suggested as a workable alternative that has the potential to mitigate negative impacts of modern conventional agriculture and at the same time, to overcome limitations of traditional agriculture in meeting the needs of China's growing population. Ecological agriculture represents a site-specific manifestation of the application of ecological economics, among others, to agricultural practices. Some challenges being experienced in translating this rhetoric into practice are identified and discussed. Highlighted is the view that sustainable agricultural development is meaningful only when it is tailored to specific ecological, economic, political and socio-cultural settings.

AB The paper shows that under reasonable assumptions about technical progress a positive sustainable growth rate fails to exist. The argument is that a growing part of income has to be spent for continuing technical progress in order to compensate the pollution effects of growth. Hence in the long run either the sustainability condition will be violated or the growth rate must decline to zero. Furthermore, in finite time the level of wealth will decrease despite growing income and a constant pollution level, thus further growth is no longer reasonable. Similar arguments also hold for the environmental effects of structural change favoring less pollution-intensive economic activities. An evolutionary change of goods and production technology may shift the limits of growth and is hence a prerequisite for a long-run EKC. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB An attempt has been made to estimate the value of present ores to future generations. The direct costs for the producer and the external environmental costs for the society of a sustainable production of ore-like metal concentrates are investigated. In a technical scenario, granite, granodiorite and basalt rock are mined, crushed and ground to give fine powders. The powders are acid leached and the extracted metals precipitated using hydrogen sulphide and sodium hydroxide to form the ore-like concentrates. All chemicals are produced in a sustainable way. Leaching efficiencies and use of energy-ware (ISO standard term for oil, coal, electricity, etc.) and chemicals are important factors in the cost estimation, as well as the number of metals mined at the same time. It is assumed that 10 different metal concentrates are produced at the same time. The technical scenario uses state-of-the-art technology. No new technical achievements are assumed. The estimated costs exceed current prices by orders of magnitude. In cost estimation for individual metals, the main uncertainty lies in the allocation of costs amongst the metals produced at the same time. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The concept of sustainability requires the acknowledgement and appropriate financing of ecological, economic and social public functions at all levels of government. Whereas the significance of socio-economic functions has a comparably long tradition in federal systems, the respective consideration of ecological functions is still waiting to be fully realised. The aim of this article is to analyse the roles fiscal federalism and fiscal instruments can play in addressing ecological public functions assigned to decentralised jurisdictions in federal systems. For this purpose, an investigation of intergovernmental fiscal relations and their significance for the local level is carried out by way of example for the Federal Republic of Germany. Based on a status quo analysis of the various German fiscal equalisation laws at the local level, the article presents options for systematically integrating neglected ecological functions and indicators into the existing legal framework. The empirical analysis shows that end-of-the-pipe and infrastructure-related ecological functions are already strongly integrated by way of conditional grants. However, precautionary functions such as nature and resource conservation issues are still largely absent. Therefore, a comprehensive consideration of ecological public functions in Germany calls for the integration of nature conservation issues and respective indicators into the system of intergovernmental fiscal relations.

AB The relationship of economic growth and environmental impact has spurred fierce debates between growth optimists referring to the phenomenon of the environmental Kuznets curve, and pessimists referring to the limits to growth. However, no operational set of simple criteria has been developed so far to assess the sustainability of a given growth pattern. This is all the more true for measures combining environmental and social criteria. The paper undertakes to sketch out such criteria, and to assess them by applying them to transdiciplinary sustainability scenarios and model simulations with PANTA RHEI, one of the most complex models of the German economy. Theoretical considerations, as well as the empirical work with the model, demonstrate that there are indeed trade offs between economic growth and environmental impacts, and a positive correlation of growth and employment. Nonetheless, it is still possible to develop carefully orchestrated strategies that combine economic competitiveness, low unemployment rates and an easing of the pressure on the environment. Social and technical innovation, reduced working time, a modernised social security system, green taxes and salary increases proportional to labour productivity growth are essential parts of any such strategy. The triple effectiveness of such strategies regarding environmental, social and economic sustainability is demonstrated by the model runs. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Food descriptors like "local", "seasonal," "farm-fresh," or "home grown" convey a connection to place and time. Little is known about how U.S. consumers conceptualize "local" and "seasonal" as applied to foods. Using a questionnaire, 120 shoppers in a grocery store and a food cooperative were surveyed. Shoppers were asked to describe the concepts of "local foods" and "seasonal foods" and to name foods that were local, not local, seasonal, and not seasonal. The concept of seasonal was multidimensional and had more meanings than the concept of local. Many foods named as local were fruits and vegetables, and many not local foods were tropical fruits. Many foods named as seasonal were fruits and vegetables, and many named as not seasonal were staple foods like meat, breads, and cereals. Locality and seasonality have specific agricultural meanings, and clarifying consumer meanings may be important in food marketing and community food systems. As the food system becomes increasingly global and decreasingly seasonal, consciousness about local and seasonal foods has implications for community economic development, environmental sustainability, human nutrition, and the operation of food markets.

SO ECONOMIC BOTANY
LA English
DT Article
DE Eden Project; interpretation of botany; geodesic domes; Cornwall
AB A description is given of the Eden Project in Cornwall, UK. The Project's purpose is to demonstrate the importance of plants to people and to promote sustainable use of plant resources. Located in a former china clay quarry, the Project has restored the landscape and built two indoor biomes under large geodesic structures: a five acre rainforest and a one acre warm temperate biome. The plantings are heavily focussed on useful plants of economic and ethnobotanical interest. The stories of many plants are also interpreted through a wide range of contemporary works of art. Eden has developed a dynamic education program at all levels from schools to Ph.D. and for adults. It has also built up a small science program with partnerships with various organisations especially in the developing world. The Project is not a conventional botanic garden, but rather a showcase for economic botany and ethnobotany. It has received two million visitors during its first year of operation.

DT Article
DE harvesting; sustainability; gaharu; CITES; NTFP
ID TROPICAL TREES; CONSERVATION; IMPACT
AB When subjected to fungal attack, Aquilaria spp. (Thymelaeaceae) produce a fragrant resin that is traded internationally as gaharu. Socioeconomic aspects of the gaharu trade were investigated via interviews with collectors and local and international traders. In addition, the extent of local and international trade was evaluated by reference to official government statistics. Evidence that gaharu resources are declining was obtained from the personal experience Of gaharu collectors, and official statistics relating to the declining number of gaharu export companies in operation. Traders also reported that the main source of gaharu has recently switched from Sumatra and Kalimantan to sources in eastern Indonesia (Maluku and Irian Jaya), a finding supported by official statistics. Disparities recorded between official figures for the price and volume of gaharu in local and international trade, supported by comments made by export traders, indicate that a high proportion of the more valuable, high-grade gaharu is traded illegally by personal transaction. Interviews with gaharu collectors indicated that traditional approaches to harvesting are declining, as more nonlocal people become involved in collection, leading to more intensive harvesting practices. Together, these findings suggest that the current Indonesian trade in gaharu is not sustainable.

AB How can decision makers reconcile the demand for increasingly reliable services drawn from the environment (including water and power) with the desire for both a better environment and more environmental amenities? In this paper, which is based on US case studies of ecosystem rehabilitation initiatives in the San Francisco Bay-Delta, the Columbia River Basin in the Pacific Northwest, and the Florida Everglades, we focus on several notable problems in current management practice. We assess the role of adaptive management and identify five areas of major innovation by which ecologists and the authorities that operate large water and hydropower systems attempt to reconcile the tension between maintaining service reliability and promoting ecological rehabilitation. The implications of the findings for a wider framework within which ecosystems can be matched to the most appropriate management regime are related specifically to aquatic-terrestrial ecosystems. Finally, we emphasize the importance of redefining ecosystem functions and services so that the inherent conflict between high-reliability services and ecosystem rehabilitation can be reconciled.

DE liquid fuels; reforns prices; Zimbabwe
AB Towards the end of the last decade, supplies in petroleum fuel have been erratic to the extent that Zimbabwe has at times operated with as low as 40% of normal supplies. These shortages were attributed mainly to foreign exchange shortages and alleged mismanagement and corruption at the National Oil Company of Zimbabwe (NOCZIM). As shortages intensified, problems of product shortage began to unfold, which adversely impacted oil the urban poor. The public began to question the industry's policies on the sustainability of the liquid fuel sector policies in Zimbabwe. Of particular concern was policies regarding regulatory mechanisms, pricing, distribution, utilisation of storage facilities, supply routes and NOCZIM management. This paper evaluates the challenges facing the Zimbabwean petroleum sector and presents recommendations that could assist in ensuring a robust and functional national fuel sector.

AB This article argues the case for introducing new energy policies in Ethiopia that will ensure energy initiatives for rural development meet the desired expectations. A review of the rural energy sector in Ethiopia is presented. Rural communities have for centuries relied solely on traditional biomass energy sources, human and animal power. In addition, sample findings show that the basic stock of traditional biomass energy resources is dwindling fast for two reasons: one, due to rapid population growth; and two, due to the absence of energy substitutes for traditional energy sources. Renewable energy technologies and other modern energy technologies are almost non-existent. In terms of budgetary allocation, rural energy development has not received a fair share of public investment in comparison to education, rural road construction and health. A key policy recommendation made in this article is the need for commitment from concerned authorities to the use of renewables for Spurring rural development. This Could be done through increasing the budget allocation to rural energy, which is currently negligible. Other policy recommendations include the modification of existing institutional frameworks for rural energy delivery, and the design and implementation of appropriate rural energy initiatives suitable for productive activities and sustainable development.

AB This paper deals with policies to meet increasing demand for electricity in Turkey and elsewhere. Turkey has a gross annual hydropower potential of 433,000 GWh; that is equal to 1% of the total hydropower potential of the world and 14% of European hydropower potential. Only 122,322 GWh of the total hydroelectric potential of Turkey can be economically used. Environmental problems created by exploitation of domestic resources should not be ignored. We comment on adverse effects of large-scale hydroelectric projects in Canada, Egypt, and the USA. We argue in favor of small-scale dams for sustainable development.

AB Ecotourism can be a vehicle for community-based conservation if it is conducted with an emphasis on the well-being of local ecosystems and human communities. Birdwatchers form the largest group of ecotourists, and are, on average, well-educated, wealthy and committed. This makes them ideal ecotourists for community-based conservation. Therefore, there is a need for a comprehensive review of birdwatching from a conservation biology perspective. Specific objectives here are: (1) to review the economic potential of non-residential birdwatching for community-based conservation; (2) to outline the potential benefits and problems associated with this activity; and (3) to provide suggestions for improving the conservation value of birdwatching. Birdwatching tourism has a high potential to improve the financial and environmental well-being of local communities, educate locals about the value of biodiversity and create local and national incentives for successful protection and preservation of natural areas. However, there needs to be more research on the economical and environmental impacts of this hobby, birdwatching-related disturbance needs to be reduced, and much has to be done to increase the financial contribution of birdwatching to local communities.

AB Mangroves, the only woody halophytes living at the confluence of land and sea, have been heavily used traditionally for food, timber, fuel and medicine, and presently occupy about 181 000 km(2) of tropical and subtropical coastline. Over the past 50 years, approximately one-third of the world's mangrove forests have been lost, but most data show very variable loss rates and there is considerable margin of error in most estimates. Mangroves are a valuable ecological and economic resource, being important nursery grounds and breeding sites for birds, fish, crustaceans, shellfish, reptiles and mammals; a renewable source of wood; accumulation sites for sediment, contaminants, carbon and nutrients; and offer protection against coastal erosion. The destruction of mangroves is usually positively related to human population density. Major reasons for destruction are urban development, aquaculture, mining and overexploitation for timber, fish, crustaceans and shellfish. Over the next 25 years, unrestricted clear felling, aquaculture, and overexploitation of fisheries will be the greatest threats, with lesser problems being alteration of hydrology, pollution and global warming. Loss of biodiversity is, and will continue to be, a severe problem as even pristine mangroves are species-poor compared with other tropical ecosystems. The future is not entirely bleak. The number of rehabilitation and restoration projects is increasing worldwide with some countries showing increases in mangrove area. The intensity of coastal aquaculture appears to have levelled off in some parts of the world. Some commercial projects and. economic models indicate that mangroves can be used as a sustainable resource, especially for wood. The brightest note is that the rate of population growth is projected to slow during the next 50 years, with a gradual decline thereafter to the end of the century. Mangrove forests will continue to be exploited at current rates to 2025, unless they are seen as a valuable resource to be managed on a sustainable basis. After 2025, the future of mangroves will depend on technological and ecological advances in multi-species silviculture, genetics, and forestry modelling, but the greatest hope for their future is for a reduction in human population growth.

AB This article demonstrates a key role that geoscience and geoscientists could be playing in promoting sustainable catchment and resource management: A new geoscience-based approach supported by a landscape-genesis (LG) model was employed to provide an alternative approach for integrated catchment management and sustainable resource use and development. The Ben Chifley Catchment case study is used to explain the application of the approach and the landscape-genesis model: The study confirmed that lithological composition, tectonic and diagenetic processes, and landform were critical factors in determining the intrinsic properties and variation in soil type, land use, land capability, steepness of terrain,. erosion, and resource degradation within the catchment. The landscape-genesis model, which is based on the geological and geomorphic genesis of the landscape, proved to be a powerful tool to predict the inherent carrying capacity and resilience of the various biophysical systems in the catchment.. Although this approach. is still in its infancy, its application has demonstrated that it has a strong potential in terms of undertaking sound integrated, assessment, predicting potential resource degradation under different land uses, and developing sound management practices and,solutions to advance the goal of ecological sustainability.

TI Investing against climate change: Why failure remains possible
SO ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS
LA English
DT Article
AB The intellectual efforts made by the World Bank and its off-spring, the Global Environment Facility (GEF), to become international facilitators of investments in global environmental protection and sustainable development in the energy sector are outlined with reference to the Framework Convention on Climate Change and its troubled Kyoto Protocol. These efforts are interpreted as part of a search for markets by Northern money and expertise. Highly paid professionals trained in a small number of. universities are the immediate beneficiaries of actions to be taken against the emission of specified gases into the atmosphere. Under pressure from environmental lobbies, the Bank and GEF employ a growing number of these environmental experts. Their rationale is threefold: belief in dangerous anthropogenic 'global warming',(1) calculation of monetary 'global environmental benefit', and identification of this benefit with the 'cost-effective decarbonisation' of energy supplies. Without this rationale, transfers of knowledge-intensive technology, capacity building and new forms of governance would forfeit legitimacy as well as many immediate professional gains. Evidence is provided to demonstrate this and it is argued that these efforts support bureaucracies in efforts to develop a global plan for 'ecological modernisation', or 'sustainable development' that will primarily benefit the North.

TI Constructing environmental (in)justice: Transatlantic tales
SO ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS
LA English
DT Article
ID JUSTICE; RACE
AB In the US, there are two primary environmental justice arenas. One is the activism, which draws on the skills of a wide range of community, academic and professional actors. This partnership draws on the Civil Rights Movement and organises through the internet. The other arena is the courtroom where environmental justice lawyers try to prove 'racial intent'. In the UK, there is an emerging call for environmental justice, but there is no comparable Civil Rights movement, just a well-organised if very unrepresentative environmental movement. However, in the UK, it is possible to discern at least three 'constructions' of environmental (in)justice: access to the countryside amongst those from ethnic minority groups; Friends of the Earth England, Wales and Northern Ireland's 'Pollution Injustice' campaign and Friends of the Earth Scotland's 'Campaign for Environmental Justice'. In the absence of a UK Civil Rights framework, there are indications that environmental and sustainability policy discourses are beginning to be re-framed around notions of justice, rights and equity. This is beginning to form a platform around which an embryonic environmental justice network is mobilising.

SO ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS

DT Article
AB In the six years of its existence, the Environment Agency for England and Wales has acquired a key role in improving Britain's environment. But a recent report from the House of Commons Select Committee has severely criticised its performance. In this article, we examine four aspects of these criticisms - lack of a coherent vision, low public profile, failure as a regulator, and lack of accountability. Our conclusion is that the critics have often failed to take into account the constraints under which the Agency operates. We can expect to see further criticisms in the future until and unless the government takes steps to clarify the Agency's proper role - whether, for example, as champion of the environment or a champion of sustainable development.

AB The 6-min walking test (6MWT) is frequently used to assess functional capacity in chronic cardiopulmonary disorders because of its simplicity. The study examines the physiological responses during encouraged 6MWT in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
   Pulmonary oxygen (O-2) uptake (V'O-2) was measured in 20 mate patients (age 66+/-6 yrs, forced expiratory volume in one second 45+/-14% predicted) during 6MWT and incremental cycling, in random order. O-2 tension in arterial blood, carbon dioxide tension in arterial blood and arterial lactate concentration ([La]-art) were obtained in the last 10 patients. During the 6MWT V'o(2) showed a plateau after the 3rd nun (1.39+/-018, 1.42+/-0.31, and1.40+/-0.30 L(.)min(-1), 4th, 5th and 6th min, respectively), and minute ventilation (V'E) (42+/-8 L(.)min(-1)) was 91% maximal voluntary ventilation.
   No differences were shown between 6MWT (6th min) and peak cycling exercise in V'O-2 (1.40+/-0.30 versus 1.41+/-0.28 L(.)min(-1), respectively), cardiac frequency (126+/-13 versus 130+/-12 beats(.)min(-1)), or arterial respiratory blood gases. The two tests were significantly different in V'E (42+/-8 versus 47+/-8 L(.)min(-1), 6MWT versus cycling, respectively), carbon dioxide production (1.30+/-0.31 versus 1.45+/-0.18 L(.)min(-1)) and [La]art (2.9+/-1.99 versus 5.9+/-1.51 M).
   The study demonstrates that an encouraged 6-min walking test generates a high but sustainable oxygen uptake. Since the oxygen uptake plateau reflects the integrated response of the system, it may explain the high prognostic value of the 6-min walking test.

AB In an experiment conducted over 8 years at the research farm of the National Research Centre for Weed Sciences, Jabalpur, we investigated the effects of mineral fertilizer and organic manures on K balances and non-exchangeable K release kinetics in a Typic Haplustert under a rain-fed rice (Oryza sativa L.) and irrigated wheat (Triticum vulgare L.) system. Each year, rice was grown with variable levels of fertilizer N with and without organic manures, while recommended rates of 26 kg P ha(-1) and 33 kg K ha(-1) were applied to both the crops. Wheat was grown without organic manure but with the same levels of fertilizer N as for rice. The apparent K balance was measured as the difference between total K added and that removed by the crop. Increasing levels of fertilizer N resulted in an increase in the negative K balance from 56 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) (control) to 103 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) at 90 kg N ha(-1) and 156 kg ha(-1) at 180 kg N ha(-1). Incorporation of farmyard manure (FYM) or green manure (GM) with fertilizer N reduced the negative K balance. Repeated extraction of soil with 0.01 M CaCl2 revealed that continuous cropping for 8 years either without fertilizer N (control) or with 90 kg N ha(-1) reduced the cumulative K release. However, the application of 180 kg ha(-1) of fertilizer N not only maintained the cumulative K release but also improved it. Incorporation of 5 t FYM or 6 t GM ha(-1) with 90 kg N ha(-1) resulted in an increase in K release by 58 and 37 mg kg(-1) soil, respectively, over the values measured in a soil sample collected at the onset of the experiment. A parabolic diffusion equation described the release rate of the non-exchangeable K. The equation suggested that the application of fertilizer N reduced the release rate of K, whereas the incorporation of manure, with fertilizers, increased it over the values obtained from soil collected at the onset of the experiment. The large cumulative K release at 180 kg N ha(-1) was due to the amount of K released initially. Continuous cropping at a fertilizer level of 33 kg K ha(-1) may pose a threat to the sustainability of the rice-wheat system. Recycling of crop residue or application of higher levels of fertilizer K may provide long-term sustainability to the system. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Increasing demands for non-timber forest products and their commercial extractions can result in harvesting methods that maximize short term economic gains with little attention to long term ecological consequences. We assessed the ecological impacts of harvesting techniques used by an indigenous group, the Soligas, on the non-timber forest products they extract from the forests of Biligiri Rangan Hills, south India. Specifically, we examined patterns of resource availability of two non-timber tree species, Phyllanthus emblica and P indofischeri, and how the current fruit harvesting techniques influence fruit yields, and susceptibility of trees to infestations by hemiparasitic plants of the Loranthaceae family. We also assessed how hemiparasite infestations affect fruit production and growth rates of Phyllanthus trees. There was considerable variation in fruit production in both species of Phyllanthus from one fruiting season to the next. The Soligas harvest an average of 86% (17.72%) of the fruit yield on a per tree basis in P. emblica and 94.17% (6.9%) in the case of P indofischeri. At the population level, 64.75 and 86.6% of the fruit productivity is harvested in P. emblica and R indofischeri, respectively. However, not all individuals or populations are harvested. Harvesting techniques used resulted in cutting of 15% of P indofischeri trees and 5% of P emblica trees. The current harvesting techniques used by the Soligas reduce fruit production in P emblica in the following year (R-2 = 0.27,p = 0.03). Furthermore, the Soligas selectively harvest fruits from trees that have larger fruit crop sizes in both species. Individual trees that carried a greater load of hemiparasites produced significantly lower fruit yields (P. emblica: r = -0.32 p < 0.013; P. indofischeri: r = -0.73,p < 0.001). The presence of hemiparasites significantly affected the growth rates of trees.
   Current harvesting techniques used by the Soligas have negative impacts on trees of Phyllanthus spp., as do infestations by hemiparasites. Current fruit harvesting strategies and techniques used by the Soligas focus on maximizing the economic returns by adopting methods of extraction such as lopping of branches and cutting of trees. Such practices can ultimately decrease the rates at which the populations grow, thereby making the extraction of Phyllanthus fruits unsustainable. Adopting more sustainable methods of harvesting appears to be one viable solution to the current ecological problem facing the conservation of Phyllanthus trees in the forests of Biligiri Rangan Hills.

ID MANAGEMENT
AB Society has grappled with the concept of managing forests sustainably for several decades. As one of the most widespread of the earth's ecosystems, and as a renewable resource providing a wide range of consumptive and non-consumptive benefits to society, forests have been at the centre of many policy discussions. While much progress was made at the Earth Summit in 1992 and since that time, there are few concrete examples illustrating the principles of sustainable forest management (SFM). Public participation in forest management is based on the hypothesis that if those whose daily fives are affected by the operation of a forest management system are involved in the decisions controlling the system, efforts can be made to protect the health of ecosystems and meet economic needs at the same time. At the same time, since ecological, social and economic conditions vary from place to place, there must be a wide range of participatory approaches to sustainable forest management. Canada's Model Forest Program was developed to provide public participation in decisions about how managing the forests supported by the most up-to-date science and technology. Within each model forest there exists a partnership consisting of a broad range of interests working within a neutral forum that is respectful of individual interests and united in the difficult task of addressing sustainable forest management. The strength of the Program lies in the fact that each partner has a voice in the overall decision-making within the model forest. Access to shared information and the learning process fostered through participation at individual and organizational levels are important factors motivating participation and fostering capacity-building. Model forests are showing that the inclusive partnership approach, although time-consuming, leads to better and more sustainable decisions.

AB Satellite remote sensing has long held promise as a powerful method of detecting forest canopy changes and mapping landscape structure over vast, often multi-jurisdictional forest areas. Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) spectral response, for example, can be related accurately to changes in physiology and cover at a range of small to intermediate mapping scales. These data have been available continuously for almost 20 years; many areas have earlier satellite image archives stretching back to the 1970s. When considering spatially-explicit changes to landscapes-caused by natural and human disturbances-over this time period, digital, synoptic, and repeatable satellite remotely-sensed data are emerging as the observational media of choice that forest managers must possess and use wisely. In this paper, successful use of satellite remote sensing in two of Canada's Model Forests is described. First, in the Fundy Model Forest in southeastern New Brunswick, a 15-year TM image sequence was used to detect area changes associated with different harvesting and silvicultural practices. Second, in the Foothills Model Forest in west-central Alberta, grizzly bear habitat maps have been created from multi-scene TM land cover mosaics. These map products constitute critical information on landscape change and configuration required to answer key management questions. The paper concludes with a prognosis for the future role of satellite remote sensing in sustainable forest management as data quality continues to improve (i.e., increasing spatial, spectral, temporal, and radiometric resolutions), and methods are brought into the purview of forest managers and practitioners.

AB This paper describes the evolution of research on socio-economic indicators of community sustainability in several Canadian Model Forest locations since 1994. In the Foothills and Western Newfoundland Model Forests, we employed an "expert-driven" approach to indicator selection and reporting. We used census data to document change over time on key community profile variables such as age, employment, income, population mobility, education attainment, poverty, and real estate values. Objective measures of these variables were supplemented with personal interviews in order to construct a more dynamic picture of community well-being. The early work of our group focused primarily on "profile" indicators-essentially static, descriptive indicators that allow one to create a snapshot of a community in time. Work is currently underway on the next generation of socio-economic indicators we describe as "process" indicators. Process indicators deal more with causal affects than outcomes. They include things like sense of place or attachment to place (which has implications for population mobility and education attainment). Process indicators also include variables such as leadership, volunteerism, entrepreneurship, and social cohesion-all of which we are attempting to include in a combined measure of community capacity.

AB The forest plays an important role in New Brunswick's economy. The Fundy Model Forest, located in southeastern New Brunswick developed a multi-stakeholder approach to public participation in sustainable forest management. This paper presents the main results of a research conducted in the year 2000 with representatives of the 31 FMF partner organizations. The objectives of the survey were mainly to verify the responsibility taken by partner organizations in term of community capacity and leadership in communities in order to develop and optimize collaborative management of forest resources. The survey was based on semi-directed interviews.

AB Over the past 10 years, the Eastern Ontario Model Forest has been developed by partners and the local community as a means of involving a large and varied group of people in achieving sustainable forestry. In this settled landscape, with over one million residents and 88% private land ownership, involvement of local communities is a given. This critical assessment looks at outstanding issues, dynamics of the operating environment, key accomplishments and unexpected outcomes that have resulted, all in the context of Naturalized Knowledge Systems.

TI The International Model Forest Network (IMFN): Elements of success
SO FORESTRY CHRONICLE
LA English
DT Article
DE IMFNS; CMFN; international; networking; Asia; Latin America
AB The International Model Forest Network (IMFN) was announced by Canada at the Rio (UNCED) Summit ten years ago to pilot outside of Canada a promising participatory field-level approach to sustainable forest management then being developed in Canada through its national model forest network. The IMFN has since grown from three sites in two countries (outside of Canada) in 1994 to 19 sites in 11 countries, in addition to numerous additional sites proposed and at early stages of development. Now with the successor event to Rio, the World Summit on Sustainable Development, about to take place in Johannesburg, South Africa, there is an appropriate milestone at which to pause and consider its evolution and growth. Among the elements of success attributed to the growth of the network the authors consider the nature of the approach itself as being an innovative re-formulation of widely shared management values, its flexibility across borders and ecosystems, and the support provided in its development by the Canadian Model Forest Network and other domestic and international partners. The article looks at similarities and differences between the international and Canadian applications of this approach and describes some of the lessons learned and difficulties met in applying the approach internationally.

   teams; public involvement; model forests
AB The management of forests has dramatically changed in the past few decades. Forest managers no longer can prepare and implement forest management plans in isolation of other resource values and local citizens. Today, the economic, ecological and social values are blended together into sustainable forest management. Finding a balance among these values in Newfoundland and Labrador is done through local district planning teams. The team participants need to understand the principles of sustainable forest management and the overall planning process. A primary focus of the Western Newfoundland Model Forest has been to support planning teams through the development of management tools to enhance management of the Province's forest ecosystems. The Model forest program will continue to test, document and transfer new and innovative management options to forest managers.

DE forest tenure; forest tenant farming; community forestry; sustainable
   rural development
AB This paper analyzes the socio-economic viability of forest tenant farming, a land leasing system that the Lower St. Lawrence Model Forest has been testing in Quebec since 1994. First, forest tenant farming is described, as is the approach used to evaluate this system. The evaluation approach is based on four criteria: viability of tenant farms, costs of general supervision and technical support, socioeconomic impact, and potential for extending the model. The results of five studies are then summarized from the perspective of the evaluation criteria, and the principal issues raised by the testing and extension of forest tenant farming are identified. The paper concludes that this management system is socio-econontically viable.

The objective was to synthesize this information in order to develop better forestry practices and identify knowledge and research gaps. Forestry-related knowledge was gathered on six broad topics: i) natural disturbances, ii) forest ecosystems, iii) past and present forest practices, iv) biological diversity, v) forest management and vi) examples of current applications of natural disturbance-based forest management. The work allowed us to synthesize a large body of knowledge into one publication that will be a useful reference for foresters in both provinces.

AB The Manitoba Model Forest and Tembec Industries (Pine Falls Operations) are operationalizing the overall goal of sustainable forest management: maintain forest ecosystem health while harvesting timber. Timber harvest guidelines intended to approximate the effects of a large wildfire were developed for spatial scales that span from the operating area down to the site. Operating area issues are addressed through landscape design guidelines that locate cutblocks and other activities (e.g., roads) within an operating area. Cut-block guidelines determine how harvesting, site preparation and regeneration are completed. These wildfire-based guidelines are being tested in four large-scale harvest trials in southeastern Manitoba. This paper describes the rationale behind the approach taken, the landscape design and cutblock operating guidelines that were developed, operational experiences from the harvest trials, and some of the challenges that arose.

DE Water Framework Directive; Common European Strategy; implementation
AB On the 23 Oct. 2000 the European Parliament and Council passed a Directive establishing a framework of community action in the field of water policy (Water Framework Directive- WFD came into force on 22 Dec. 2000: Official Journal of the European Communities). The implementation of this Directive will have very considerable lon-term implications on information needs and research objectives covering all European river basin and coastal zones.
   An effective and coherent water policy must take into account of the vulnerability of all surface and ground waters, including aquatic ecosystems located near the coast and estuaries or in gulfs or related closed seas, as their equilibrium is strongly influenced by the quality of inland waters flowing into them.
   There are diverse conditions and needs in the community, which require different specific solutions. This diversity should be taken into account in the planning and execution of measures to ensure protection and sustainable use of water in the framework of river basins. Decisions should be taken as close as possible to the locations where water is effected or used. Priority should be given to action within the responsibility of Member States by drawing up of programmes of measures adjusted to regional and local conditions.

AB 1. Zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha ) have established a much greater range in North America and Europe than quagga mussels (D. bugensis ), which occupy a very similar niche.
   2. We hypothesised that quaggas are physiologically capable of sustaining populations in warmer rivers currently occupied only by zebra mussels and that unidentified, non-physiological factors account for their more limited distribution.
   3. Growth and survival of individually tagged mussels (976 D. bugensis from Lake Erie; 2625 D. polymorpha from Lake Erie and the Ohio River) were recorded monthly for up to 15 months in an outdoor stream mesocosm receiving unfiltered water from the Ohio River.
   4. Extreme temperatures stressed both species; but in contrast to several previous laboratory studies, quaggas survived high temperatures better than zebra mussels. We suspect this was the result of species-specific differences in their ability to obtain, assimilate and/or catabolise food at high, sublethal temperatures.
   5. A unimodal growth pattern was observed in both species, with the highest growth rates from late spring to early autumn.
   6. Our survival and growth data suggest that quaggas are not physiologically limited from expanding southward.
   7. While lacking definitive proof that dreissenid populations in rivers are ecologically sustainable without upstream lentic ecosystems and/or unintended human intervention, we suggest that complex river currents and upstream retentive and highly productive slackwater habitats in rivers may help sustain downstream populations of these meroplanktonic, dreissenid mussels.

TI Environmental issue entrepreneurship: a Schumpeterian perspective
SO FUTURES
LA English
DT Article
AB In this paper, the recent growth in national and international environmental legislation and the subsequent emergence of rather vague ecological concepts like sustainable development and the precautionary principle, are analyzed from a Schumpeterian perspective in which polical issue entrepreneurschip plays a central role. Schumpeter wrote that the emergence of unfavorable circumstances in capitalist societies will activate strong opposition from social critics and intellectuals. Is modern environmentalism one of the most powerful recent forces that will further impact capitalism? Did Schumpeter foresee this evolution and what are the mechanisms that did lead to this situation? We discuss aspects of Schumpeterian issue entrepreneurship and relate these to theories on the emergence of environmental regulation, the expansion of environmental organizations, the use of new instruments in environmental policy and pro-active business strategies.

AB As both population and energy use per capita increase, modem society is approaching physical limits to its continued fossil fuel consumption. The immediate limits are set by the planet's ability to adapt to a changing atmospheric chemical composition, not the availability of resources. In order for a future society to be sustainable while operating at or above our current standard of living a shift away from carbon based energy sources must occur. An overview of the current state of active solar (photovoltaic, PV) energy technology is provided here to outline a partial solution for the environmental problems caused by accelerating global energy expenditure, The technical, social, and economic benefits and limitations of PV technologies to provide electricity in both off-grid and on-grid applications is critically analyzed in the context of this shift in energy sources. It is shown that PV electrical production is a technologically feasible, economically viable, environmentally benign, sustainable, and socially equitable solution to Society's future energy requirements.

TI Soil degradation assessment in mixed farming systems of southern Africa:
   use of nutrient balance studies for participatory degradation monitoring
SO GEOGRAPHICAL JOURNAL

DT Article
DE South Africa; Botswana; soil degradation; nutrient balance studies;
   participatory assessment; mixed farming
AB Soil degradation assessments for mixed farming systems of the Molopo Basin (North West Province, South Africa and Southern District, Botswana) are provided from farmer-based research, designed to quantify nutrient fluxes across the farming system and to analyze the social, economic, political and environmental factors affecting nutrient management practices. This paper discusses the practical difficulties of how to use participatory farmer-led studies to assess soil degradation extent and its causes, and of then disseminating this information to farming communities and policymakers. Nutrient balance studies show that land degradation is evident on arable fields as soil nutrient depletion (the main threat to poorer manure-reliant farmers) and soil acidification (the main threat to wealthier farmers who have become dependent on inorganic fertilizer additions). Integrated nutrient management strategies involving both compound fertilizer additions and regular manure inputs can mitigate most soil degradation even on the sandy infertile Kalahari soils, but remain infrequently practised. The need to retain nutrient flows through the livestock sector from rangeland to arable land is thus vital to environmental sustainability and offers an applicable entry point for agricultural development initiatives and support. Factors identified as threatening the flow of nutrients from rangelands to arable lands include policy settings in terms of the different support programmes offered to communal farmers, village-level extension advice, household poverty levels and labour constraints.

AB To develop indicator-based management tools that can facilitate sustainable natural resource management by non-specialists, meaningful participation of stakeholders is essential. A participatory framework is proposed for the identification, evaluation and selection of rangeland condition indicators. This framework is applied to the assessment of rangeland degradation processes and sustainable natural resource management with pastoralists in the southern Kalahari, Botswana. Farmer knowledge focused on vegetation and livestock, with soil, wild animal and socio-economic indicators playing a lesser role. Most were indicators of current rangeland condition; however 'early warning' indicators were also identified by some key informants. This demonstrates that some local knowledge is process-based. Such knowledge could be used to improve indicator-based management tools and extension advice on the livelihood adaptations necessary to prevent or reduce ecological change, capable of threatening livelihood sustainability. There is evidence that social background influences indicator use. Communal farmers rely most heavily on vegetation and livestock indicators, whilst syndicate and landowning pastoralists cite wild animal and soil-based indicators most frequently. These factors must be considered if indicator-based management tools are to meet the requirements of a diverse community.

ID POVERTY
AB Informal settlements house a significant percentage of the population of developing cities, yet there is no common planning framework for upgrading these settlements. Conventional method-based approaches applicable to new areas or sites and services schemes are inappropriate and so the dominant approaches currently available tend to focus on principles and best practices. Yet neither of these has yet provided a convenient basis for replicability on a significant scale. This paper argues for a return to a method-based approach For upgrading and sets out a planning framework that could Form the basis for such an approach. It is based upon the ability of external interventions to address the key issue of vulnerability and argues for the need to plan for the long-term sustainability of informal settlements. It uses the experience of a pilot project in Cape Town to demonstrate the practicality of the planning framework. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

TI Nursing shortage redux: Turning the corner on an enduring problem
SO HEALTH AFFAIRS
LA English
DT Article
AB Projections of a substantial nursing workforce imbalance in the coming decade have galvanized policymakers, providers, private foundations, nurses, and others to proffer aggressive and sustainable strategies to ameliorate the looming shortage. The solutions are largely ones that seek to increase supply. Analysis of the 1992-2000 National Sample Surveys of Registered Nurses shows that increasing losses from the active workforce, stagnant wages, and low levels of job satisfaction pose major impediments to bolstering supply. Strategies focused on working conditions and retention should occupy a central position in any nursing workforce revitalization plan.

TI The impact of price changes on demand for family planning and
   reproductive health services in Ecuador
SO HEALTH POLICY AND PLANNING
LA English
DT Article
DE reproductive health; elasticity of demand; cost recovery; pricing
AB Donor funding for family planning and reproductive health (FP/RH) has declined in Latin America over the past decade, obliging providers to consider other financing mechanisms, including cost recovery through user fees. Pricing decisions are often difficult for providers, who fear that increased fees will cripple demand and create barriers to access for poor clients. Providers need information on how changes in price can affect utilization of services, and how to resolve trade-offs between generating income and serving poor clients. This paper reports on an experiment that measured the impact of higher client fees on utilization, revenue and client socioeconomic characteristics at 15 clinics operated by CEMOPLAF, an Ecuadoran not-for-profit FP/RH agency. The study improves on previous research by comparing effects of different price levels on demand for services. We conclude that demand was inelastic for three of CEMOPLAF's four main FP/RH services, and we found no evidence that the price increases had a disproportionate impact on utilization by poorer clients. The study therefore provided CEMOPLAF managers with knowledge that price increases at the levels tested would help to achieve sustainability goals (by increasing locally generated income) without undermining CEMOPLAF's social mission.

ID USER FEES; QUALITY; IMPACT
AB This article describes and analyzes the impact of the introduction of a cost recovery system in 11 health centres of Tillaberi district, Niger, West Africa, between August 1997 and August 1999. The study is based on data collected by the health workers, observations of district activities and policy meetings and literature from similar programmes in the region. The central question addressed by this article is why a well-formulated programme, which was implemented accordingly, failed to succeed.
   The system described fits within the national health policy framework in Niger, which opted to introduce fixed attendance fees in health centres. The system was introduced as a part of a comprehensive package to improve the accessibility, quality and organization of the districts' health care. Discussed are the problems encountered in the functioning of the system, such as the unpredictability of the cost recovery rate, the drop in patients' attendance and the undermining effect of serious and regular shortages of essential generic drugs at the wholesale dealer. Further discussed are the supervision and control of the financial and drug administration and the participation of the population, which are identified as key areas of interest for sustainability of any cost recovery system.

ID PROGRAM; CHILDREN; PROJECT; IMPACT
AB Unintentional injury, with its broad range of injury, types, possible countermeasures, and great number of agencies involved in its prevention, lends itself to community-based approaches. In this paper we examine 10 community-based injury prevention programmes that have targeted childhood injury prevention and have been evaluated using some measure of outcome, We investigate the nature of the intervention, targeting, the length of programmes and multi-agency involvement. We also consider how the programmes have been evaluated, and what outcome, impact and process measures have been used. The in formation on the intervention and how it was evaluated, how effective the programme was, and the strength of the evidence, is summarized in tabular form. There is increasing evidence emerging about the effectiveness of community-based approaches in injury prevention. Important elements of such approaches are long-term strategy, effective focused leadership, multi-agency collaboration, tailoring to the needs of the local community, the use of local injury surveillance, and time to coordinate existing and develop new local networks. We recommend that there is a need to develop indicators to assess and monitor a culture of safety, programme sustainability and long-term community involvement.

AB The human population is expected to reach about 10 billion by 2050, and it can be questioned how we can provide the food and the essential nutrients that will be needed. The ultimate goal of MARICULT was to provide a basis for the evaluation of environmental constraints and the potential for increased sustainable provision of food, raw materials and energy from the ocean. The Programme has primarily addressed fundamental questions on the marine ecosystem, because new concepts of harvesting and mariculture must be based on knowledge, and the environmental impact of new concepts should always be elaborated together with their production potential. The work has involved studies of food web structure and its functioning in the marine ecosystem as well as more applied research and testing of concepts for increasing the harvesting potential. There is a relatively tight connection between the nutrient supply rate and the primary production of phytoplankton, but the response of single species of animals is less predictable, especially for single populations on high trophic levels. There is, however, an empirical positive relationship between nutrient supply and secondary production, including fishery yields, on a regional scale. The low contribution of fisheries and aquaculture to human food compared to the contribution by agriculture is due to the fact that we primarily exploit first and higher carnivores. The general strategy to increase the marine harvesting potential is therefore to harvest and cultivate organisms at lower trophic levels. A number of harvesting and production concepts that may allow enhanced availability of marine resourses are proposed. These involve (1) harvesting of herbivore zooplankton resources, (2) cultivation of benthic, herbivore/omnivore animals, (3) enhancement of production potential by the creation of artificial up-welling systems, (4) strategic fertilization or use of available nutrient resources, and (5) further exploitation of biomass from macro-algae. All concepts involve harvesting or cultivation at low trophic levels, and some may readily be combined. It is important to note that some methods are not feasible for all coastal regions. In spite of great similarities, there are some clear differences in how the ecosystems react to enhanced nutrients in European marginal seas (Baltic Sea, Mediterranean Sea) and in Atlantic waters. Negative ecological effects caused by enhanced nutrient supply to pelagic ecosystems may occur if the primary production is not being grazed efficiently by zooplankton or benthic grazers. Dispersion by advection or retention in deepwater are important modifying factors. Loss of integrity in food web function seem to occur above a certain nutrient loading rate, suggesting a critical nutrient-loading rate for the maintenance of food web integrity. The Programme has contributed to a conceptual platform for assessment criteria of the state of the ecosystem and the water quality in pelagic coastal waters that are potential components in nutrient management models. The western principles of removing nutrient wastes from biological cycling is hardly sustainable. The counter-measure strategy that is still not explored and implemented is to reduce the ecological effects of uncontrolled nutrient emission in the coastal zone by using these nutrients for mariculture production. A more holistic ecological view in management and resource exploitation, where we recognize that we are also components in the ecosystem, is well accepted in eastern Asian countries, but not in the West. A holistic perspective may contribute to more concern for the ma

TI European mussel cultivation along the Atlantic coast: production status,

SO HYDROBIOLOGIA
LA English
DT Article
DE Mytilus edulis; carrying capacity; culture methods; culture areas
ID MARINE AQUACULTURE; SPAIN
AB Mussel culture in Europe produces about 50% of the annual world-wide harvest of mussels. The main yields of atlantic mussels are from Spain, The Netherlands and Denmark, while the Mediterranean production predominantly comes from Italy. Production in these traditional areas have been stabilised since the 1970s, and the share of Europe in the world production has decreased due to increased production outside Europe. The following factors are important in analysing production status and perspectives. Mussel production is based on an extensive culture and depends entirely on natural resources for food, spat and space. In the main culture areas, production with existing techniques seems to have reached the system's carrying capacity. Spat availability can be an additional limiting factor, particularly in bottom culture. In many traditional mussel culture areas, new functions have developed, such as recreation and nature conservation, and therefore extension of mussel culture is now also space limited. Expansion of mussel culture in Europe takes place in areas like Scottish fjords, Ireland and Greece, and is planned in Norway. Further development of sustainable mussel culture in Europe has different requirements for traditional and for new areas. In new areas the main problems are harmful blooms, local productivity and development of markets. Culture in traditional areas would benefit from optimisation of the system's exploitation capacity, improved spat collection and active participation in coastal zone management. This implies communication with other stakeholders, and exploitation of the mussel stocks within the framework of ecosystem management. Experience with this type of mussel culture is also relevant for development in the new culture areas.

AB Fisheries management is a crucial issue worldwide, but it is proportionally more crucial in developing countries that rely heavily on inland fisheries. Management requires proper knowledge of fish behaviour and habitat use, as can be achieved through telemetry techniques, although these are most rarely used in tropical regions. Here we report briefly on the outcomes of a pilot workshop and training course aiming at improving technology transfer and capacity building, laying the stress on strengths and weaknesses of this approach, as evaluated by trainees.

AB In the course of the 'Meuse Salmon 2000' programme, most weirs and dams (3-8 m in height) in the regulated River Meuse have been progressively equipped with new fishways in order to restore the free circulation of all amphibiotic fish species. Nevertheless, fish entering into major spawning tributaries are still confronted with various kinds of physical obstacles of which the overall impact on fish migration has never been investigated. In order to test their ability to negotiate physical obstacles, 128 individuals of fish ( Salmo trutta, Thymallus thymallus, Salmo salar, Chondrostoma nasus, Barbus barbus and Esox lucius) were captured several weeks before their spawning migrations and tagged with radio-transmitters. They were tracked from 30 to 466 days in the River Ourthe and six spawning tributaries over the period October 1995 to June 2001. All obstacles recorded in this study have been classified according to their type and main characteristics (i.e. slope, length and height). Results indicated that most fish migrate during or outside the spawning period and that some small obstacles are not as insignificant as initially thought and can significantly disrupt and/or obstruct their upstream movements. There is a need to harmonize interests in the sustainable conservation of fish populations and the development of small-scale hydropower generation and tourism.

ID MORTALITY; GROWTH
AB Study on the population dynamics of siboga squid Doryteuthis sibogae in Thoothukkudi coast revealed that the seasonal change has definite impact on the growth of this species. The growth parameters viz. L-infinity, K, t(0), C, and phi were 39.5 cm, 0.4, -0.02, 0.5 and 2.9 respectively. Mortality parameters Z, M and F were estimated as 2.27 / year, 0.91 / year and 1.36 / year. Weight was more or less square function of length rather than in cubic function. This squid was found to have two recruitment seasons, one major season during December and a minor season during April. The length structured virtual population analysis revealed heavy fishing pressure on the length group 17 - 20 em and hence the fishery of D. sibogae was not found to suffer due to recruitment overfishing in Thoothukkudi waters. Estimated total stock, average annual stock and maximum sustainable yield(MSY) were 529.47, 209.14 and 217.33 tonnes respectively. Present level of exploitation rate (U) and exploitation ratio (F/Z) was estimated to be 0.5372 and 0.6 respectively. The study infers that the cod end mesh size of the trawls of Thoothukkudi has to be increased from 10 to 25 mm to increase the yield per recruit. Further, the effort should be reduced and maintained at the exploitation ratio of 0.45 to get maximum yield per recruit. The study suggests reducing the present level of effort by 10 percent to sustain the stock of D. sibogae in Thoothukkudi waters.

AB The 'state' of British forests is evaluated in an ecosystem approach using selected Indicators Of Sustainable Management. These include forest damage, crown condition, growth, nutrition, biodiversity, soil and water quality. Reference to relevant datasets derived from research or monitoring programmes demonstrates that, in general, British forests are in a satisfactory condition. Forest productivity has been maintained, and may be increasing. Tree crown condition, used in many monitoring programmes as an indicator of vitality or health, has remained relatively stable since monitoring began in the mid 1980s. British forests seem to be nutritionally well balanced, and reliance on fertilizer inputs is very low. Despite significant atmospheric deposition inputs to many forests, soil and water appear within understandable and tolerable quality limits. The biodiversity of British Forests, both semi-natural and plantation, is surprisingly rich. The implications of further environmental change are briefly discussed.
