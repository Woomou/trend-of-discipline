TI Assessment of recharge to groundwater systems in the arid southwestern

AB The sustainability of community water supplies drawn from shallow aquifers in the arid southwest of the Northern Territory has been evaluated using the radioactive isotope chlorine-36 (Cl-36). These aquifers include fractured sandstones of the Ngalia Basin, fractured metamorphic rocks and Cainozoic sands and gravels. Cl-36/Cl ratios for these shallow, regional groundwaters exhibit a bimodal distribution with peaks at 205 (+/-7) and 170 (+/-7)x10(-15). Th, higher ratio probably represents modern (Holocene) recharge, diluted with windblown salts from local playa lakes, and occurs mostly around the margin of the basin. The lower ratio corresponds to a Cl-36 "age", or mean residence time, of 80-100 ka, implying that the last major recharge occurred during the last interglacial interval (Oxygen Isotope Stage 5). These values are mainly observed in the interior of the Ngalia Basin. Lower values of the Cl-36/Cl ratio measured near playa lakes are affected by addition of chloride from remobilised salts. Finite carbon-14 (C-14) data for the groundwaters are at variance with the Cl-36 results, but a depth profile suggests low recharge, allowing diffusion of recent atmospheric carbon to the water table. The Cl-36 results have important implications for groundwater management in this region, with substantial recharge only occurring during favourable, wet, interglacial climatic regimes; most community water supplies are dependent on these "old" waters.

ID HOLISTIC APPROACH; MANAGEMENT
AB This paper addresses the water resources management problems in China. Considering the pressure of increasing population, present barriers to alleviation of floods, droughts and water environmental problems have been carefully analysed from the Chinese practical background. The discussions involve water resources and problems in managing water supply and demand in China. Due to very uneven distribution of precipitation in space and time, China frequently suffers from floods and droughts. But the coincidence of the rainy season with the warm season is favourable to crop production and thus results in high population density in the eastern part of China. In order to avert disastrous consequences of hydrological extremes-floods and droughts now and in the future-studying sustainable development of water resources in China is an imperative. Based on results of such studies, existing barriers to sustainable development of water resources have to be removed. A number of feasible measures adaptable to the specific conditions of China are proposed. A step-by-step strategy is suggested to keep abreast of the changes of the objective circumstances, and to provide for public consensus.

TI Biophysical demand and sustainable water resources management: an
   Australian perspective
SO HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES
LA English
DT Article
ID NUTRIENT
AB To develop a sustainable management system of any water resource, it is essential that a balance between the demand of the natural biophysical system and the need of the socio-economic development is achieved. The main challenge that water managers grapple with is how to reconcile the long-term environmental objectives with the short-term political, social and economic needs. Since the biophysical resources underwrite all socio-economic activities, it is imperative that the long-term health of surface water and groundwater systems be the primary driver for sustainable management of water resources. If the environmental need to sustain the ecological values of water is overlooked, then serious water quality problems will arise and the natural aquatic ecosystem will deteriorate to a level such that both social and economic developments become unsustainable. Case studies on water quality and recent water reform initiatives in Australia are discussed in this paper to demonstrate the paramount importance of the biophysical system for sustainable water resources management.

AB An investigation of barriers to a more sustainable management of the available water resources in a Zimbabwean catchment has been conducted. Currently (spring 1997), the water resources of Zimbabwe are managed according to the 1976 Water Act. Two types of barrier have been identified: those directly related to the Water Act and others related to the traditional perception of water resources in Zimbabwe. Barriers related to the Water Act include the existing water right system, a highly centralized system of decision making, and a non-participatory system. Other barriers are the price of water, lack of information (both water resources system data and socio-economic data), lack of drought planning, and little or no environmental concern.

AB Predicted climate change over the coming decades is likely to add measurable stress to water resources in many regions of the world, including some areas that are currently well endowed. The stresses are likely to involve changes in the frequency of extreme events as well as gradual changes in mean annual net resources. The paper analyses these predictions. It also attempts to place them in context, first, comparing their impact with other major barriers to sustainability, such as increasing demand, wastage, poor water resources assessment and international conflict, and, secondly, considering the limitations of current predictive techniques.

SO HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES

DT Article
AB There has been much recent emphasis on sustainable development of water resources in that the needs of the present generation are fulfilled without compromising future generations to meet their needs. Also, systems of flood protection and management are being increasingly considered in the context of sustainable development. Destructive floods have jeopardized settlements located near rivers since the dawn of human history. Now, the global flood losses have grown worldwide to the level of billions of US dollars per year. The issue of climate variability and change and the possibility of their adverse impacts on the severity and frequency of flooding, introduces an additional uncertainty to difficult sustainability issues. There are several examples of technical infrastructure related to flood protection, which are being criticized in the context of sustainable development because they close options for future generations and introduce unacceptable disturbances in ecosystems. Large structural flood defences like dams, storage reservoirs and embankments are often listed in this category. The means of coping with floods are looked at in the sustainability context. A change of paradigm is needed, as a flood protection system guaranteeing complete safety is an illusion. It is necessary to be aware of the possibility of floods, that is the attitude: "living with floods" seems more sustainable than a hopeless striving to "combat floods".

TI Introduction of block-wise use of TOPMODEL and Muskingum-Cunge method

AB For the sustainable management of water quantity and quality, a hydrological model that can simulate the hydro-environmental dynamics of river basins at arbitrary locations is valuable. There are several streamflow simulation models suitable for such a purpose. Yet the lack of data commonly poses a serious problem for their application. This is a serious problem encountered for the sustainable management of water resources at a basin scale. This paper describes a combination of TOPMODEL with the Muskingum-Cunge flow routing method to overcome the problem at least partially. The resultant block-wise version of TOPMODEL is used to simulate daily flows in the data-rich 3570 km(2) Fuji-kawa basin, central Honshu, Japan and in the data-poor 20 750 km(2) northern part of Minjiang basin above Dujiangyan, Sichuan Province, China. The results demonstrate the potential use of the model for hydro-environmental simulation in a large data-poor basin.

AB The effect of integrated use of fertilizers (100, 50 and 0% N and full dose of P and K recommended for each crop in cycle) and organic manures [farmyard manure, sunnhemp (Crotalaria juncea L.), pressmud cake and cane trash applied to sugarcane plant crop and their residual effect on subsequent crops] on soil fertility, physical properties besides productivity of crops grown in crop cycle, sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum L.) plant - sugarcane racoon - gingelly (Sesamum indicum)- rice (Oryza saliva) was studied. Available nitrogen and phosphorus improved due to integrated use of fertilizers and manures at 100 and 50% nitrogen but depleted when no fertilizers and manures were applied. Though the soil available potash depleted at all levels of fertilization, the extent of depletion was lower under integrated use of fertilizers and manures. The bulk density lowered and infiltration rate, water-holding capacity improved under integrated nutrient management system. Integrated use of fertilizers (100% NPK) and organic manures (cane trash+pressmud cake) resulted in highest cane and sugar production of sugarcane plant and ratoon crop and grain yield of gingelly. However, the residual effect of farmyard manure and 100% NPK resulted in maximum production of rice. Application of 50 N+ 100% P and K and direct and residual effects of organic manures resulted in sustainable crop production which is nearer to 100% fertilizers alone.

SO INTERNATIONAL DENTAL JOURNAL

AB When primary health care (PHC) was developed and implemented in developing countries, oral health was not included. The present consequences are marked disparities in the distribution of oral health care, since conventional dentistry can only serve relatively few people and at high costs. Oral health care is virtually non-existent in rural areas of most developing countries where more than 80 per cent of the population live. More recently, community based oral health programmes have been initiated in some countries to fill the gap. These programmes give more emphasis on oral health promotion and on the prevention of oral diseases than on treatment of its consequences, since history has shown that the latter is ineffective in preventing oral diseases. Unfortunately, most of these oral health programmes have been implemented next to the existing PHC system and hence they face enormous management, logistic and financial problems, which seriously threaten their sustainability. This paper presents a proposal to counteract the problems that many countries face in developing an adequate primary oral health care (POHC) service.

AB Purpose: Conventional portal verification requires that a qualified radiation oncologist make decisions as to the set-up acceptability. This scheme is no longer sustainable with the large numbers of images available on-line and stringent time constraints. Therefore the objective of this study was to develop, optimize, and evaluate on clinical data an artificial intelligence decision-making tool for portal verification, The tool, based on the artificial neural network (ANN) approach, should approximate, as closely as possible, portal verification assessments made by a radiation oncologist expert,
   Methods and Materials: A total of 328 electronic portal images of tangential breast irradiations were included in the study. A radiation oncologist expert evaluated these images and rated the treatment set-up acceptability on a scale from 0 to 10, Translational and rotational errors in the placement of the radiation field boundaries formed seven-dimensional feature vectors that represented each of the 328 portal images/treatments. The feature vectors were used as inputs to a three-layer, feedforward ANN, The neural network was trained on the oncologist's ratings.
   Results: The rms discrepancy between the ANN and the expert's ratings was 1.05 rating points. Using the decision threshold equal to 5 for both sets of ratings, the ANN classifier was capable of detecting 100% of the portals classified as "unacceptable" by the expert. Only 6.5% of portals acceptable to the oncologist were misclassified as "unacceptable" by the ANN,
   Conclusion: The results of this study indicate the feasibility of using the ANN portal image classifier as an automated assistant to the radiation oncologist, Its role would be to recommend an appropriate decision as to the acceptability or otherwise of a given treatment set-up depicted in a portal image.

AB The health problems that young people experience are largely related to psychological and behavioural factors. Peer led initiatives have a positive effect on several factors that influence young people's health. Self-esteem, self-efficacy and locus of control are particularly important to young people's health. The particular strengths of peer support and reciprocal peer support in achieving effective health promotion are described.

ID RHINOCEROS
AB A follow-up of a Baculovirus oryctes release into the population of Oryctes monoceros in coconut plantations in Tanzania has been made to clarify important points which were not fully considered in an earlier publication. The low recovery of virus-infected field-collected beetles (29%) suggested that the release of B. oryctes virus was not a suitable method for the control of O. monoceros. The relatively dry conditions in the coconut growing areas were partly contributory since the Virus is non-occluded. No significant and sustainable reduction in fiend damage was obtained after the virus had established itself in the natural O. monoceros population. The status of O. monoceros as a serious pest of coconut is also revised since the beetle affects young plantations more than older plantations and control methods can be directed at picking up feeding insects by hooking and disposal of breeding sites.

AB 'Green Revolution' was adopted as National Agricultural Policy by the Government of India to meet the requirements for food grain self-sufficiency Improved seeds, fertilizers and irrigation were provided as science and technology (S&T) inputs to the soil resource base of the country. Land use changes in order to increase the area of land under cultivation have resulted in sectoral imbalances. The introduction of irrigation, fertilizers and new seed varieties using the district as a unit of agricultural input and management, without consideration of moisture and pedogenetic requirements at the micro-level, have resulted in ecological imbalances and environmental degradation in some parts of the district. Intensive irrigation has resulted in water mining in some blocks, and over a period of years the upper aquifer has been lost and in parts of the Aligarh district water-logging and salinity development has taken place.
   This paper presents the concept of spatial information systems far sustainable agriculture to eliminate the overdose effect of S&T inputs in a land system such as the fragile ecosystem at the semi-arid border in India.
   The present study has attempted to integrate the natural resource endowments of lithology, soil, ground-water and geomorphology into terrain mapping units (TMUs). The geological, geomorphological and soil maps were generated using remotely sensed data. For ground-water, well logging was carried out and secondary data regarding depth to water-table were collated. The spatial modelling for depth to water-table was carried out using SURFER software. The files on geology, geomorphology, soil and depth to water-table were digitized and integrated to generate an illuminated model characterized by areas of homogeneity in terms of geology, geomorphology, soil and groundwater conditions to map the TMUs. Intergraph's Modular GIS Environment (MGE) software was used to integrate the multiple data base.
   For sustainable agriculture the natural boundaries represented by TMUs will be more appropriate as spatial units for the application of agricultural inputs and management practices for the land system, rather than villages, blocks and districts which have cultural boundaries. The methodology proposed will be useful for all ecosystems in semi-arid and arid regions. (C) 1999 Academic Press.

ID EQUILIBRIA
AB This paper presents a model of an economy with two representative agents (a capitalist and a worker) who play an infinite-horizon dynamic game about income distribution. We consider three types of equilibria, which correspond to joint price-taking (Walrasian equilibrium) and to wage-setting by either the capitalist (capitalistic equilibrium) or the worker (laborist equilibrium). For the last two of them, an inefficient feedback Stackelberg solution is first analyzed. Afterwards we apply a version of the Folk theorem and obtain a wide range of sustainable efficient equilibria, one of which coincides with the Nash bargaining solution. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

ID VEGETATION; MITES
AB The quantity and quality of fruit in 2 adjacent apple orchards in eastern West Virginia were compared between 1 conventionally managed orchard and 1 with ground cover plantings underneath apple trees and reduced insecticide applications. Four species of plants [dill, Anethum graveolens L.; buckwheat, Fagopyrum esculentum Moench; dwarf sorghum, Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench; and rape, Brassica napus L.] were planted in alternating, single-species strips under the tree canopy, and only 1 broad-spectrum insecticide (phosmet) plus Bacillus thuringiensis was applied in the ground cover orchard over the 2-yr period (1995-1996) of the study. The conventional orchard received 5 applications of an organo-phosphate each year. Disease management was the same for both orchards. The ground cover orchard had significantly greater populations of spirea aphid (Aphis spiraecola Patch) and leafhoppers [Typhlocyba pomaria McAtee, Edwarsiana rosae (L.), and Emposaca fabae (Harris)] than the conventional orchard. The conventional orchard had more damage from fire blight than the ground cover orchard. Total yield of apples from the ground cover orchard was significantly less than in the conventional orchard, probably because of competition by the ground cover plants for water and nutrients. Fruit quality was lower in the ground cover orchard in 1995 (76% undamaged fruit compared with 80% undamaged in the conventional orchard),but in 1996 there was no difference in fruit quality between orchards (75% undamaged fruit). Plum curculio, Conotrachelus nenuphar (Herbst),damage was significantly different between orchards, but different orchards had greater damage in each year. In 1996, fruit in the conventional orchard had more apple scab, but in the ground cover orchard fruit had higher levels of summer rots and other diseases. In this study, ground covers and reduced insecticide use were not an acceptable alternative to conventional pest management because of reduced yield. However, with better management of ground cover plantings to avoid excessive competition with the apple trees, this strategy of pest management shows promise for reducing insecticide use in apple orchards.

AB Among birds, falcons are high-performance flyers, in many cases adapted for aerial hunting and hence suitable targets for investigating limits to Eight performance. Using an optical range finder, we measured flight tracks of Eleonora's falcon (Falco eleonorae), a species breeding in the Mediterranean region and specialised for hunting autumn passage bird migrants, when commuting between their nesting colony and offshore hunting areas (straight transportation flight) and when searching for prey (transecting and searching flight). Airspeed during searching flight was significantly slower than during straight transportation and transecting flight, but there was no significant difference in airspeed between the latter two flight modes. Straight transportation flight was significantly faster than predicted minimum power speed. Also, during straight transportation flight, the falcons responded to head- and tailwinds by increasing their airspeed when flying into the wind. However, they did not shan any significant airspeed adjustments with respect to the angle between the track and the heading, as would be expected in birds trying to maintain a constant track direction. Mean sustainable climb rate (during greater than or equal to 240 s) was 1.4+/-0.31 m s(-1) (mean +/- S.D., N=13), which is rather a high rate for a bird the size of an Eleonora's falcon. The climb rate was used to calculate maximum load-carrying capacity and maximum sustained horizontal flapping flight speed. The mean wingbeat frequency during powered climbing Eight was 4.68 Hz, which was used to estimate the mass-specific muscle work.
   When falcons were leaving the colony for offshore hunting, they gained altitude by slope-soaring when there was an onshore wind. We formulated a simple criterion for the required gliding-flight rate of climb during an initial slope-soaring episode when minimizing the energy cost of reaching a certain altitude far out over the sea (which is where the prey is to be found). This climb rate was 0.36 m s(-1), and our observations indicated that the falcons experienced climb rates above this value when soaring in slope-lift.

AB To learn about muscle function in two species of tuna (yellowfin Thunnus albacares and skipjack Katsuwonus pelamis), a series of electromyogram (EMG) electrodes was implanted down the length of the body in the internal red (aerobic) muscle. Additionally, a buckle force transducer was fitted around the deep caudal tendons on the same side of the peduncle as the electrodes. Recordings of muscle activity and caudal tendon forces were made while the fish swam over a range of steady, sustainable cruising speeds in a large water tunnel treadmill. In both species, the onset of red muscle activation proceeds sequentially in a rostrocaudal direction, while the offset (or deactivation) is nearly simultaneous at all sites, so that EMG burst duration decreases towards the tail. Muscle duty cycle at each location remains a constant proportion of the tailbeat period (T), independent of swimming speed, and peak force is registered in the tail tendons just as all ipsilateral muscle deactivates. Mean duty cycles in skipjack are longer than those in yellowfin. In yellowfin red muscle, there is complete segregation of contralateral activity, while in skipjack there is slight overlap. In both species, all internal red muscle on one side is active simultaneously for part of each cycle, lasting 0.18T in yellowfin and 0.11T in skipjack. (Across the distance encompassing the majority of the red muscle mass, 0.35-0.65L, where L is fork length, the duration is 0.25T in both species.) When red muscle activation patterns were compared across a variety of fish species, it became apparent that the EMG patterns grade in a progression that parallels the kinematic spectrum of swimming modes from anguilliform to thunniform. The tuna EMG pattern, underlying the thunniform swimming mode, culminates this progression, exhibiting an activation pattern at the extreme opposite end of the spectrum from the anguilliform mode.

AB The governments of two countries explicitly negotiate over a new pair of tariffs. As soon as they reach agreement, the countries put into effect the agreed-upon pair of tariffs, which must be self-enforcing. We investigate how the difference in the two governments' patience affects the negotiation results. Provided that the common optimum tariff is the status quo tariff rate for each country, we find that the country with the more patient government gains most from the negotiation if the time lag between a defection and punishment in the implementation phase is short. The opposite is true if the response lag in the implementation phase is long. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science BN. All rights reserved.

AB Microbiological fertilizers are an important part of environment friendly sustainable agricultural practices. A study was conducted in order to investigate seed inoculation of sugar beet (cv. Sonja) and barley (cv. Tokak), with nitrogen fixing (Bacillus polymyxa) and phosphate dissolving (Bacillus megaterium var. phosphaticum) bacteria in comparison to control and mineral fertilizer application in the green house and in the field at two sites in 1996 and 1997 in Erzurum (29 degrees 55' N and 41 degrees 16' E with an altitude of 1950 m), Turkey.
   In the green house trial bacterial inoculation of seeds increased sugar beet root and barley seed yields compared with control. II. polymyxa was more effective, but dual inoculations gave increases of 19.0 and 25.9% respectively. In the field as an average of sites and years sugar beet root yields were increased by 12.0%, 7.5% and 16.5% while barley seed yields were increased by 15.0%, 8.4% and 18.2% respectively with B. polymyxa, B. megaterium var phosphaticum and dual applications over control treatment. Other yield and yield components were also enhanced especially by dual applications. However, increases in yield and yield components were lower than or comparable to mineral fertilizer application. The beneficial effect of bacterial inoculation was higher in well irrigated pot trials and at the site of rich clayey soils.
   In conclusion, microbial inoculation of seeds with Bacillus polymyxa and B. megaterium var. phosphaticum, alone or in dual combinations, may substitute costly NP fertilizers in sugar beet and barley production even in cold highland areas such as in Erzurum.

AB Objective To identify resource allocation decisions and policies and procedures used by school foodservice directors that were based on the concepts of pollution prevention, product stewardship, and sustainable development.
   Design A questionnaire about operational characteristics (including equipment and production systems, menu selection and service style) and environmental issues was mailed to school foodservice directors.
   Subjects/setting Subjects were school foodservice directors in major cities who were members of the American School Food Service Association. Of the 389 questionnaires mailed, 168 (45.5%) were returned and used for data analysis.
   Statistical analysis performed Descriptive statistics, analysis of variance, and correlation mere used to analyze data.
   Results Cost factors were rated more important (P less than or equal to.05) than environmental factors when operational decisions were made. Labor was ranked as the most important future issue by 45.0% of respondents, but it was not the most important factor when current operational decisions were made. Less than 20.0% of the respondents indicated that their districts had specific water (3.3%), energy (14.2%), or solid waste management policies (16.0%). However, 62.6% of respondents stated that their district had a recycling program.
   Applications/conclusions With the exception of recycling programs, school foodservice departments have not adopted a framework of pollution prevention, product stewardship, and sustainable development practices. Recycling and energy conservation programs and use of locally grown food products would minimize the environmental impact of school foodservice operations while reducing operational costs.

AB Water is, and most likely will continue to be, one of the main concerns and potential causes of instability in the Middle East (ME). The contribution of the existing renewable water resources is limited and can not fulfill the long-term projected gap between water supply and demand for most of the countries in the ME. An integrated regional approach for fulfilling this gap was preferred. A regional institutional framework was proposed for the implementation of this integrated regional approach and consists of a regional water board operating through three units for technical, implementation, and management aspects of project and activities. An analysis of the regional water supply and demand development, the design and policy making of the proposed institution, technology and water markets, cooperation, actors and beneficiaries, finances, and expected obstacles and constraints to the establishment and sustainable operation of the proposed institution are included.

AB Most spatial decision support systems for natural resource planning and management are limited by their scenario-based (non-behavioral), deterministic (non-stochastic) structure. A spatial decision support system is developed that uses a multiple attribute decision-making model to explain how a property manager selects a land and water resource management system (LWRMS) based on its multiple, stochastic economic and environmental attributes. The decision support system assesses sustainable resource management at the property and watershed scales and identifies the most cost-effective policy for enhancing sustainable resource management. Economic attributes are determined with an economic model and environmental attributes are simulated with an environmental model. Input parameters for both models are generated with a geographic information system. The decision support system is used to rank five LWRMS for a sample of 20 farmers in Missouri's Goodwater Creek watershed and for two hypothetical watershed alliance groups. Results indicate that the average farmer and the two alliance groups would rank the five LWRMS in the same manner. From the viewpoint of the watershed alliance, the most preferred LWRMS for the average farmer in the watershed is sustainable.

DE developing countries; impact; sanitation programmes; sustainability
AB Sound strategies for community water supply and sanitation programmes in developing countries should be based on (i) a clear understanding of the existing problems, (ii) the beneficial impacts achievable, and (iii) the factors which determine sustainability The impacts of many water and sanitation programmes are limited, and many systems break down and are abandoned prematurely; only limited impacts are achievable in the short term without greatly increased investment. Sustainability, in the sense of continued delivery and uptake of services, is threatened by numerous attitudinal, institutional and economic factors, and community participation approaches alone are no guarantee of success. The key to sustainability is that all stakeholders involved in consumption/use, maintenance, cost recovery, and continuing support, perceive it in their best interests to deliver high-quality services.
   This paper, based upon the authors' experiences in Africa and Asia, proposes new sets of programme aims and objectives in relation to impact and sustainability, which can be used in programme design, monitoring and evaluation. It also makes longer-term recommendations to external support agencies.

AB The great scallop Pecten maximus (Bivalvia: Pectinidae) supports a substantial European fishery with a recent history of declining catches caused by over-exploitation. The sustainable exploitation of shellfish populations requires knowledge of the extent to which commercial grounds are reproductively self-sustaining or supplied with larvae originating from further afield. The degree of genetic differentiation between locations can provide important indirect evidence, reflecting the pattern and scale of effective larval dispersal. Pecten maximus were sampled from five locations around the Isle of Man, from Mulroy Bay (Ireland) and from Plymouth. Restriction-site variation was investigated in two PCR-amplified mitochondrial DNA fragments of 2 and 3 kb, respectively Haplotype and nucleotide diversity within populations, and nucleotide divergence between populations, were calculated. Mean nucleotide sequence divergence was corrected for within-population polymorphisms and visualized by UPGMA cluster diagrams. Molecular analysis of variance (AMOVA) was carried out. Results showed low levels of population differentiation. Slight but significant differentiation between Isle of Man populations was revealed, with East Douglas appearing distinct from the remaining Manx locations. The analyses also indicated the distinction of Mulroy Bay from the other populations, and the lowest genetic variability was recorded from this enclosed habitat. This probably reflects the relative isolation of Mulroy Bay, whereas dynamic hydrographic conditions in the Irish Sea and the Channel may generally ensure extensive mixing of the planktonic larvae.

AB In these times of rapid environmental and organizational change, there is increasing demand for sustainable, continuous innovation. Science research organizations, which operate at the cutting edge of creative innovation, require organizational designs capable of supporting this growing trend. This article identifies four distinct design archetypes, which are then integrated into a comprehensive typology for the analysis of science organizations. Case studies of a set of eight comparable research institutes in New Zealand highlight the various design options available to science organizations as well as the performance implications of these options.

AB Resource-use decisions made by households and local communities in pursuit of today's survival and livelihood security are influenced by the policies, institutions, and technologies that impact on their lives. Such decisions are the main determinants of links between poverty elimination, improved land care, and sustainable rural livelihoods. In the long term such goals can be compatible but in the short term the need for increased yields with increasing populations is likely to undermine sustainable natural resource management. Increasing analysis and understanding of poverty, its measurement, and identification of the processes that create poverty, as well as improved land care are key to creating sustainable livelihoods. Hillside and mountainous areas are particularly vulnerable to poverty due to their inaccessibility, fragility, marginality, and diversity. Although many of the world hot spots for land degradation are found in hillside areas, there are also many bright spots where improvements in natural resource management are resulting in increased incomes. Poverty elimination will require revival of the community stake in the natural resource base, restoring local control over local resources, and use of local perspectives and traditional knowledge systems in development activities. New policies, institutions, and technologies will need to reflect these principles.

AB This paper focuses on the recently emerging, but infrequently considered, reasons for the non-adoption of soil conservation (SC) technologies by local farmers. They include insufficient economic returns on farmer investments which are often long-term in nature and difficult to perceive or measure. More recent innovations, such as multipurpose hedges or cover crops, are often able to provide either productivity benefits within one year, or lateral benefits, such as marketable products, that offset the farmers' investment. Unfortunately, artificial incentives are still used by many government-funded projects to promote expensive traditional structures aimed at soil retention rather than vegetation cover. Such measures attract interest for the wrong reasons and seldom outlive the project since they undermine farmers' motivation to experiment or innovate. Rather than focus on the long-term adoption of a given technology SC projects should aim at building community capability for sustainable agricultural development. This will encourage farmers to adapt technologies according to their changing circumstances which will result in a sustainable development process. Capability should be built through farmer-to-farmer dissemination which begins by training the best motivated farmers as extensionists. Technologies should be simple, based on locally available materials, and offer rapid easy to recognize benefits that will motivate farmers. Productivity, or income generated on the recuperated soil, must be increased. Technologies for harvesting water may be required to make this viable.

AB This paper highlights the scarcity of arable cropland in the hills and mountains of the Himalayan region. This is one of the factors leading to food insecurity and poverty. Technological interventions were applied in some areas to increase the amount of land available by making productive use of marginal areas. This has been supported by strong political commitment which facilitates a favorable policy environment for investment in technological research, enterprise, and infrastructure development. These experiences indicate a new thinking which advocates research into 'niche based' sustainable production systems on marginal lands as part of the solution to cropland scarcity. Better management of marginal land and improved livelihoods may result.

AB The second half of the twentieth century has seen nuclear power evolve from the research and development environment to an industry that supplies 17% of the world's electricity. The past decade, however, has sent stagnation in nuclear power plant construction in the Western industrialized world, slow nuclear power growth in Eastern Europe and expansion only in East Asia. But the turn of the century is potentially a turning-point for nuclear power because of: inn easing world energy consumption, with nuclear power's contribution to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, nuclear fuel resources sustainability, and improvements in operation of current nuclear power plants; advanced reactor designs that will improve economics and availability, and further enhance safety; and continued strengthening of the nuclear power safeguards system. This paper looks at the role that small and medium-sized reactors can play in an increasingly competitive global energy market, particularly with regard to maintaining a sustainable mix of energy sources.

AB Analysis of current types of public transport shows that they are mismatched to geography of modern towns, the form of which is dominated by the availability of the car. A new kind of public transport has been sought which can meet both the requirements of the user for effective transport, and the non-user for an exemplary urban environment. It has been found that exploitation of existing technologies can meet these requirements in a new type of transport. This can be described as a personal automatic taxi system running on its own guideway network. It is shown that this can offer effective transportation at energy and emission costs which are reduced by an order of magnitude compared to the current car-road system. Initial studies also suggest that the new system can be economically viable. The new transport system, which is an improved version of types previously proposed under the general description of personal rapid transit, appears to offer an attractive and genuinely sustainable alternative to the car for urban transport in the next century.

AB This paper traces the emergence of coastal management in the late twentieth century and assesses the social and spatial implications of the new Integrated Coastal Management (ICM) philosophy that guides national regulatory programs worldwide. A review of the epistemology of ICM reveals its link: to the United Nations marine regulatory regime (thr Law of the Sea) and the sustainable development paradigm embraced at the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development. I suggest that the resulting regulatory regime facilitates the opening of coastal zones worldwide to aggressive state and global capital investment. By promoting the overhaul of existing social and spatial organization in coastal zones and by asserting the primacy of resource access fur modern economic interests, ICM may introduce more rather than less social conflict and ecological degradation. To illustrate this dynamic, I examine the case of coral reef management in general, and in the context of the Sri Lankan ICM program.

AB The associated development of global change research programs and the adoption of a global approach to the ocean by Agenda 21, Chapter 17 have generated an increasing need for investigations into coastal, deep ocean, and island management. To contribute to the development of ocean sciences vis-a-vis this need, in 1996, the international Geographical Union (IGU) launched the Oceans program. In 1998, the International Year of the Ocean, this program was implemented and converted into the Oceans 21 program, convened by the IGU and the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of UNESCO. The epistemological and conceptual backgrounds of this program framework, jointly with its key contents, are presented and discussed, as well as its consistency with the program areas and sectoral issues of Agenda 21.

AB As our industry has struggled to reduce cost, attention has centred on maintenance flexibility particularly through the negotiation of contract language. To date, the results have often failed to meet expectations. This paper will discuss the importance of the supervisor as being the key leader of change. While contractual language is a fundamental prerequisite, leaders bring language to life. It is vital that supervisors become leaders for sustainable change to occur.

ID MINIMIZATION; LANDFILL; ENGLAND
AB The UK waste strategy is based upon the central concept of the hierarchy of preferable options for the treatment and disposal of waste. Minimisation is placed at the top of the hierarchy and the Government seeks to encourage its uptake by industry and commerce as well as householders. It has been accepted that previous waste management policy and practice have not delivered the hoped for movement up the hierarchy. Within the UK, landfill still predominates as the option most commonly used to deal with waste. Movement towards more sustainable waste management practice has been identified as a priority, in the UK, by the present Labour Government. To that end, they have recently produced a series of consultation papers on sustainable issues that set out their vision and confirm, waste minimisation as a key strategy for the future. In an attempt to stimulate the uptake of minimisation methodology by industry, waste minimisation clubs have been developed across the UK. There have been around 60 such clubs and they receive support and guidance from it range of organisations, including the Environment Agency and the ETBPP. These clubs have demonstrated that a significant reduction in waste arisings can occur when minimisation methodology is applied. Minimisation strategies often lead to improved resource efficiency and this is reflected in clear financial savings, e.g. the Leicester Waste Minimisation Initiative recorded mean savings, at the end of year one, of 0.26% of joint turnover. The median, however, better reflects the actual savings and it is apparent that even within a successful club there can be a wide range of performance by companies. Not all clubs have been successful and there has been little attention to the causes of failure in the UK. There are marked regional variations in club distribution and the proposed Regional Development Agencies, working with the Environment Agency, need to quickly establish strategies for minimisation uptake.

AB Soil fungi and nematodes isolated from a long-term Sustainable Agriculture Farming Systems (SAFS) project research site at the University of California, Davis were investigated in microcosm systems. Nitrogen-free sand in the columns was amended with ground alfalfa and cellulose, with total N held constant, to create C-to-N ratios of 11:1. 15:1, 20:1, 25:1, 30:1, 35:1, 40:1 and 45:1. Nitrogen mineralization by Aphelenchus avenae and Aphelenchoides composticola feeding on Rhizoctonia solani and Trichoderma sp. was determined by measuring ammonium and nitrate concentrations in the leachate from the columns at 3-d intervals. Nematode population numbers and the fatty acid 18:2 omega 6c, a fungal biomass indicator, were monitored by destructive sampling on d 0, 7, 14 and 21. For R, solani, but not Trichoderma sp., there was significantly more N extracted from columns in the presence of either nematode species than in the absence of nematodes. Average N-mineralized nematode(-1) d(-1) was 1.8 ng for A. avenae and 3.3 ng for A. composticola when feeding on R. solani. As the C-to-N ratios of organic substrates increased, total mineral N decreased with R. solani alone, but in general remained the same in the presence of nematodes. Initial and average nematode population densities were significantly higher in columns containing R. solani than in those with Trichoderma sp. Both nematode species reduced the fungal fatty acid 18:2 omega 6c in Trichoderma columns on d 21. The fatty acid 18:2 omega 6c was lower in columns containing both R. solani and A. composticola on d 0 and 7 and higher on d 14 and 21 than those in the absence of nematodes.

AB This paper analyzes soil-related agronomic constraints in the Sitiung region of Indonesia that are directly related to low nutrient-holding capacity, macroporosity, and rainfall regime. This region receives 2500 to 3000 mm of rainfall per year; but nearly 50% of the rainfall is disposed of rapidly via internal drainage. Although rapid internal drainage reduces the risks of erosion, it leads to infertility, acidity, and Al toxicity. The physical structure of the soils is: characterized by stable aggregates, with numerous macropores in the surface and a predominantly microporous subsoil matrix interspersed with a few larger macropores. Macropores account for about 29% of porosity in the surface and between 3 and 6% in the subsoil. The saturated hydraulic conductivity of the matrix containing macropores averages about 300 to 400 cm/day, whereas that of the microporous matrix is generally <1 cm/day. The structure facilitates rapid infiltration and leaching of rainfall. However, little opportunity exists for nutrients moving downward with drainage water to accumulate in the subsoil. The main reason for this seems to be the low hydraulic conductivity and the, preponderance of excessive wetness in the subsoil, Drying seems to be essential for movement of nutrients into the subsoil matrix, However, most of the agronomic crops are sensitive to Al toxicity and fail to grow roots deeper than: 10 to 15 crh. Thus, they suffer from water stress, despite heavy and frequent rainfall, and fail to cause drying of the subsoil, Problems of acidity; AZ toxicity, and infertility worsen progressively where agricultural production consists mainly of Al-sensitive crops. Although liming with calcium carbonate improves the soil chemical environment, downward movement of lime is very slow. Deep: liming is effective in improving rooting depth, crop water availability, and drying of the subsoil, but the technology is cost- and labor-intensive. Native vegetation, on the other hand, is able: to:grow roots to considerable depths and causes significant drying of the subsoil, even without soil amendments. Thus, production systems: in which locally adapted vegetation of economic value is the-main focus: seem to be more sustainable and conducive to improving soil conditions.

TI Solar versus green: The analysis of a Norwegian row house
SO SOLAR ENERGY
LA English
DT Article
AB There are, presently, two schools of thought when it comes to designing buildings that promote sustainable development. One school emphasizes materials use and "green" buildings, while the other emphasizes energy use and low energy/solar buildings. The promoters of "green" buildings often claim that the reduced energy use during operation of the low energy and solar buildings is counteracted by the increased embodied energy in these buildings. This paper describes the results of a study of embodied energy and energy use in operation during the lifetime in a wooden row house. The house, designed and;built as a solar house with very low energy use during operation, is located in southern Norway. It features both passive and active solar measures. In the study, the built version is compared with four other versions: two versions where the house is designed according to the requirements of the new Norwegian Building Code, one version where the house is designed according to present standards in Norway, and one version where the house is designed according to the principles used by the architects presently building "green" buildings in Norway. The results, which are also compared with some results from German studies, show that solar buildings have a lower overall energy use, when both embodied energy and energy use during operation are taken into account. The results also show that there should be little difference between the approaches of the two schools of thought. The best buildings will generally be those that are both solar, low energy, and "green". (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Decentralization: An effective method of financial management at the
   grassroots (evidence from India)
SO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Haryana is among the 20 Indian states currently implementing the Joint Forest Management Programme (JFMP). Protection and management of degraded forests by village level institutions - hill resource management societies (HRMSs) - in partnership with the Haryana Forest Department could be described as a significant step in delegation and to an extent in devolution of forest protection and management roles and responsibilities, A significant outcome of JFM to the HRMSs has been the enormous funds that have been generated at the village level. These have been expended to fulfil community needs.
   A study conducted in five HRMSs to understand the mechanism of fund utilization revealed that major portions have been utilized for human development and lesser amounts for forest development activities. The process adopted has been one of consensus with well established mechanisms for regulating misuse. The success of the study villages has been presented as evidence in support of successful decentralization and financial management at the grassroots and the potential of many HRMS type institutions to develop into strong institutions with a high degree of institutional and financial sustainability.

TI Micro-level sustainable biomass system development in Central Himalaya:
   Stress computation and biomass planning
SO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Indian rural populations greatly depend on natural resources for meeting various biomass needs, especially in a geographically difficult area like the Himalayas. A number of external interventions in the form of expansion of commercial fuels, afforestation, harvesting renewable energy sources, dissemination of fuel saving devices etc have been introduced to attain sustainability in meeting the energy demands, but the major focus remains on the inherent potential of the biomass system to produce various biomass and meet fuel and fodder demands.
   The present study analysed the biomass scenario in 25 villages in the Central Himalayas, identified issues in biomass planning, evolved methodologies for biomass estimation, computed enduse-wise stress and devised biomass management methodology. Possibilities of attaining sustainability in meeting fuel wood and fodder demands were reviewed based on the data from ten villages and the methodology has been detailed by taking the case of Nauli village. The methodology also suggests the ways by which biomass planning may be integrated with non-biomass resources, technologies and schemes. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

TI Alternative scenarios of social development: Is analytical

SO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB In the article some alternative scenarios of social development are presented and discussed in detail. The following scenarios are discussed: (i) the Deep Ecology Scenario, (ii) the Strong Sustainable Development Scenario, (iii) the Weak Sustainable Development Scenario, (iv) the Boomsday Scenario, (v) the Doomsday Scenario and (vi) the World Bank 'Policy Tunnel' Scenario. In the article it is noted that the environmental EKC hypothesis can be connected theoretically to the Boomsday Scenario and loosely to the World Bank 'Policy Tunnel' Scenario.
   On the basis of scenario analysis, it is pointed out that sustainable development is not a conflict-free concept because the criteria of sustainability (environmental sustainability, economic efficiency and social equality) cannot be simultaneously met in most of the scenarios analysed. Global strategies that are based on the general, simple concepts of sustainability can be even harmful for developing societies. A useful approach for the sustainable development policy formation is sustainability thinking that is based on the analytical positioning of the current situation. The strategic guidelines of the new positioning framework are presented in the article.
   On the basis of theory-based scenario analysis it is noted that the situation-based framework may help international development agencies, as well as well national and local governments, in the formation of analytical environmental policy strategies, Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

AB The paper is about negotiating with issues that discourage innovation. The subject is environmental deterioration, with concern directed at, the impediments that keep it from being innovatively resolved. The paper is organized around three issues. (1) The dominant model of environmental concern, called environmental protection, is managed predominantly via command and control approaches. (2) Command and control, by relying on analytical segmentation to subdivide the problem into digestible bits and using formal legislation to direct it, are not up to emerging challenges in the area. (3) More robust models are available but difficult to experiment with due to impediments that discourage change. These impediments are seen in ideals associated with protection, prevention, recycling, and sustainability that tend to do more to sustain harmful practices than to seek beneficial alternatives, Being able to appreciate the underlying restrictions of entropy could help stimulate a more innovative agenda.

SO TECHNOLOGY IN SOCIETY

ID PRODUCT
AB How to establish a complex high-tech systems engineering industry is crucial for many newly industrializing countries to further their economic development beyond efficient manufacturing of relatively simple products. Because the aircraft industry is a user and driver of advanced product and process technologies, in 1990 Taiwan's government officially designated this industry as a national strategic area to receive policy support. The ultimate success of this endeavor depends on the transformation of a combat aircraft producer into a commercial champion and the sustainability of the supporting industries. However, the prospect of defense conversion is dismal. The commercial benefits of military work are minimal because military and civilian needs of design are very different and so are scale economies, scope economies, and experience curve. Moreover, neither spin-off nor dual-use strategy can apply effectively, leaving the focal company an enclave isolated from the local industry. Another insurmountable barrier is the integral architecture of the aircraft and engine systems. In this industry, most functional and design specifications and standards are imposed by the upper-tier buyers and integrators. This implies that the lower-tier firms cannot pursue their own engineering and production competence rather independently and flexibly as most other local firms in Taiwan do in the fields of highly open components and easily adjustable interfaces. This case typifies a government's futile efforts in a global industry of complex proprietary technological systems and points to the criticality of defense conversion and systems architecture in the commercial world of systems engineering.

TI The slum upgrading myth
SO URBAN STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
ID INDONESIA; COMMUNITY
AB The World Bank's slum upgrading approach, used for the first generation of its urban development projects during the 1970s and 1980s, was considerably influenced by the writing of John F. C. Turner. Turner minimised the role of government, limiting it to providing essential environmental improvements and public services, thereby allowing squatters and/or slum-dwellers to improve gradually their living conditions. While early evaluations of slum upgrading projects in Calcutta, Jakarta and Manila indicated the success of this approach, later evaluations raise doubts about it. The 'minimal. state' advocated by Turfier is clearly unable to deal with the problems typically emerging from slum upgrading efforts. For these efforts to be sustainable and replicable, more attention must be paid to providing land tenure, requiring a combination of authoritarian and humanistic administration.

ID GROWTH
AB Dewatered and non-dewatered sewage sludge from a secondary treatment plant was applied to plots planted with three Salix (willow) clones according to the Swedish short-rotation forestry concept. Stem biomass production was enhanced by the sludge application rate, which varied between 2.5 and 20 t DS/ha/yr. Sludge metals in general accumulated in the soil within the layer in which the sludge was applied, whereas metal transportation below this point was less pronounced. Concentrations of nutrients and metals in plant tissues were not influenced by the sludge application rates, but decreased in general with stem and stand age. Improved sewage sludge quality in recent years is contributing to the possibilities of designing sustainable systems for sludge use on productive land-for instance, in short-rotation forestry for biofuel production.

AB Experience in several East Asian countries of collecting and disposing of municipal solid waste (MSW) through the mobilization of locally available resources is discussed. These resources are represented by various stakeholders in MSW management, namely, the public sector, the formal private sector, the informal private sector and community and nongovernmental organizations. Attention is given to the nature of MSW, the nature and role of each major MSW stakeholder, the constraints to the development of partnerships among MSW stakeholders, illustrative case studies of MSW resource mobilization in East Asia and lessons learned from these experiences. Among the lessons learned are the critical importance of: (1) a service-oriented collaboration between public MSW authorities and other MSW community resource stakeholders; (2) the involvement of all MSW stakeholders in MSW decisionmaking; (3) the selection of affordable and sustainable MSW management technologies; and (4) the identification and recovery of MSW investment, collection and disposal costs.

AB It is increasingly clear that there is a need to assist National Hydrological Agencies in Africa to improve their hydrometric data collection capabilities and at the same time to halt the decline in hydrometric standards. This has to be achieved in a cost-effective and sustainable way and, at the same time reinforce existing systems with new technology and equipment and strengthen the institution capacity of these agencies. The Southern African Development Community-Hydrological Cycle Observation System (SADC-HYCOS) will provide the framework, methodologies and tools to achieve this goal. This paper provides the first opportunity to inform the global hydrological community of the aims and activities of the SADC-HYCOS project. Significant advances will be made in the installation of real time data collection platforms and transmission system, the development and implementation of a regional database, the improvement and/or development of data exchange and dissemination systems using a regional electronic network and Internet links, the development of hydrometeorological products from the database and establishing a large scale training programme relating to activities during the life-time of the project.
   SADC-HYCOS will promote the collection, processing and exchange of hydrological data and information within the region and raise the profile of the regional hydrological issues, hydrological research, operational hydrology, availability of data and information to a global audience.

AB Objective Following an outbreak of measles in 1989-1991,a blueprint for change was developed to improve immunization coverage by addressing deficiencies in the immunization delivery system. A review was undertaken by the National Vaccine Advisory Committee (NVAC) to assess progress in improving immunization coverage, decreasing disease incidence, and developing an immunization delivery system to serve children in the United States. Based on this review, strategies were recommended to sustain success in immunization coverage.
   Participants A Subcommittee on Immunization Coverage was appointed by the chairman of the NVAC in 1995 and included representatives from federal agencies, professional organizations, vaccine manufacturers, state and regional health departments, and academic centers.
   Evidence Presentations on immunization programs, strategies, and financing were made to the subcommittee by representatives from federal, state, and local agencies; professional organizations; insurers; businesses; and public and private health care providers. Evidence from the published literature also was reviewed.
   Consensus Process After review and discussion of evidence presented, conclusions and recommendations were crafted and endorsed by members of the subcommittee. The subcommittee's report was submitted to the NVAC for review, comment, and approval.
   Conclusions Although incidence rates of traditional vaccine-preventable diseases are at all-time low levels and corresponding vaccination coverage rates are at all-time high levels, a system to ensure timely vaccination of the 11 000 US infants born each day that also incorporates newly recommended vaccines is incomplete. Key barriers include lack of financing of vaccination in many insurance programs and the lack of implementation of evidence-based interventions to raise coverage levels. The NVAC makes 15 recommendations to achieve a sustainable childhood immunization delivery system organized around (1) vaccination financing to ensure full insurance coverage of recommended vaccines and to support the Vaccines for Children program; (2) provider practices to ensure the implementation of recall/reminder systems and office-based assessment of coverage levels; (3) information systems for monitoring disease, vaccination coverage, and performance on immunization delivery; and (4) support for communities and families to ensure that the public is aware of the importance of vaccination, that resources are focused to help underserved children, that immunization linkages with WIC (the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children) are enhanced, and that citizen coalitions can advocate improvements in the immunization delivery system.

AB Ni-supported catalysts on perovskite-type oxides have been prepared by "solid phase crystallization" (spc) method and tested for CO2 reforming of CH4 into synthesis gas at 850 degrees C. The Ni catalysts were obtained in situ during the reaction from the oxides as the precursors in which nickel species were homogeneously incorporated in the perovskite structure. Ni/Ca0.8Sr0.2TiO3 and Ni/BaTiO3 catalysts showed high activity as well as high sustainability among the catalysts tested. The high activity may be due to highly dispersed and stable Ni metal particles (diameter < 1 nm) on the perovskite, where the nickel species thermally evolve from the cations homogeneously distributed in an inert perovskite matrix as the precursors during the reaction. Nickel species was partly incorporated in the perovskite structure by replacing the Ti site and partly separated as NiO from the structure after the calcination of the precursors, and the former species likely affords the highly dispersed Ni metal under the reducing atmosphere. The amount of NiO detected by XRD analyses was smaller on BaTiO3 than on Ca0.8Sr0.2TiO3, while that of surface Ni obtained by TGA was larger on Ca0.8Sr0.2TiO3 than on BaTiO3. It is thus likely that an incorporation of Ni was enhanced in BaTiO3 compared to Ca0.8Sr0.2TiO3, resulting in the higher dispersion of Ni metal particles on the former support. This well coincided with the activity of Ni/BaTiO3 being higher than that of Ni/Ca0.8Sr0.2TiO3 at high space velocity. The high sustainability against coke formation may be partly due to the mobile oxygen as well as due to the presence of alkaline earth metals in the perovskite supports. Oxygen mobility in the perovskite was further tested by CO2 pulse reactions, suggesting an easy migration of oxygen over the perovskite structure. It is most likely that the oxygen easily migrates from the supports to the surface of fine Ni particles, where the coke material can be oxidized into carbon oxides. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

ID CHANGING-ROLE; CROPS
AB Since the 1950s, there has been unprecedented concern over the environmental and public health problems associated with the use of chemical pesticides on the basis of the message carried in the book 'Silent Spring' that deals with a new pest management strategy that integrates disciplines Like agronomy, genetics, biology, and chemistry. Thus, this strategy forms the Integrated Pest Management (IPM). Efforts to implement IPM revealed poor adoption in case of resource poor farmers, though effective for industrial farming areas. Yet, the preferred approach for the present and future is IPM. Farmers desire that IPM strategy should be simple, easy to operate with sizeable economic returns. Thus, much depends on developing a perspective of stewardship rather than domination over nature. If tradition is made the foundation for modernity coupled with use of such chemical levels that enhance overall efficiency, its acceptance by farmers is assured. That would ensure ecological viability and economic sustainability to crop production endeavours.

AB Sustainable agriculture must produce enough food and fibre to satisfy changing human needs while conserving natural resources, maintaining the quality of environment and ultimately lending to community and gender equity. lit the developed countries in Europe and to some extent in USA, chemical fertilizer has been held as a major culprit for environmental pollution, especially the nitrate enrichment of groundwater. However, evidence available also indicates that, animal slurry and septic cess pools largely contribute to nitrate enrichment of groundwater and also to environmental pollution with ammonia and nitrogen oxides (NO,). There are other sources of environmental pollution such as exhaust fumes from motor vehicles, flyash from thermal power plants and other industrial effluents. Developing countries such as India, reeling under population pressure with no additional cultivable land are forced to increase their fertilizer consumption, which as of today is much less than the actual crop needs. Nevertheless, we must learn lessons from the ill-effects of overuse of chemical fertilizer by developed countries and use it judiciously with a well-planned integrated plant nutrient supply system.

TI The effect of a domestic violence interclerkship on the knowledge,
   attitudes, and skills of third-year medical students
SO ACADEMIC MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
ID FAMILY-VIOLENCE; SCHOOL
AB Purpose. To determine whether participation in an intensive domestic violence interclerkship (DVI) improved the knowledge, attitudes, and skills of two successive cohorts of students at the University of Massachusetts Medical School.
   Method. The authors measured the knowledge, attitudes, and skills pertaining to domestic violence of third-year students in the classes of 1997 and 1998 using a validated written examination administered before, immediately after, and six months after participation in a 3.5-day or two-day DVI, respectively; they compared the scores using paired t-tests. Nine months after the DVI, the students' domestic violence screening skills were measured by a performance based assessment (OSCE); using unpaired t-tests, the authors compared the OSCE scores with those of a previous third-year class that had not participated in a DVI. Immediately after the OSCE, the students reported their levels of confidence in domestic violence screening and their satisfaction with the domestic violence curriculum; using chi-square analysis, those self-reports were compared with those of the class with no DVI.
   Results. The students who participated in the DVIs immediately and significantly improved their knowledge, attitudes, and skills (p < .001), and fully or partially sustained those improvements six months later (p < .001). Nine months after the DVI, the students performed domestic violence screening more effectively (p < .001), expressed greater comfort with domestic violence screening (p < .001), and felt better prepared by the curriculum to address domestic violence issues (p < .001) than did the students with no DVI.
   Conclusion. Participation in a short, focused DVI curriculum produced sustainable improvements in knowledge, attitudes, and skills that were successfully applied by third-year medical students to effective domestic violence screening. Interclerkships are an effective way to fit into the clinical curriculum those subjects that transcend the traditional biomedical domain and intersect all areas of medical practice.

TI African archaeology: The call of the future
SO AFRICAN AFFAIRS
LA English
DT Article
ID GHANA
AB African archaeology, both in theory and practice, suffers from a burdensome colonial experience. By gaining independence, the temptation to fashion the past in terms of models of European nationalism must be countermanded by a serious consideration of the role and character of nation states in an open global society. The emergence of divisive sectarian, ethnic or linguistic factions requires new models of nation-building that can facilitate the integration of diverse groups without the authoritarian hegemony of any ruling party. African archaeology should aim to provide examples of such forms of government in pre-European contexts.
   Africa's archaeological and cultural heritage in the light of the current global economic disparities should not only contribute to a sense of pride and achievement, but must also become a means to economic development and trans-cultural education. Archaeologists can provide policymakers with models of alternative tourism, and may contribute to the revival of traditional crafts, as well as the use of archaeological know-how in locating water resources, discovering sustainable modes of subsistence, and workable models of social organization. None of these contributions, however, can be achieved at the current pitiful level of financial support. Local governments and international organizations are asked to contribute effectively to the capacity building of African archaeological institutions. The road to a better future lies in reshaping our notions of our common past and our shared human bonds. Africa is no longer the dark continent it was once believed to be, but, by contrast, the continent where humanity saw the dawn of its day. Africa has been and remains an integral element in the fabric of humanity. The veil of its recent colonial experience should be lifted to reveal the shining face of its achievements in the art of living.

AB Environmental legislation is forcing a rethink about desirable crop production systems. The development of new production systems that meet economic and environmental objectives demands knowledge about which input-output combinations are feasible and optimal in practice. A review of concepts in agronomy and in farm and behavioural economics leads to a conceptual model with a division into production levels and accompanying production restricting factors. The highest production level can be defined by merely agronomic growth factors; the next production level is restricted by a mixture of economic and other agronomic factors. The two lowest levels are further restricted by taking into account the socio-psychological factors. With the production restricting factors of the conceptual model the differences in agronomic efficiency of actual and theoretical input-output combinations will be analysed in order to find out which input-output combinations will be feasible and optimal in practice.

AB There is a general need for quantitative tools that can be used to support policy makers in regional rural development. Here, a framework for (sub-) regional land use analysis is presented that quantifies biophysical and economic sustainability trade-offs. The framework, called sustainable options for land use (SOLUS), was developed over a 10-year period of investigation in the Northern Atlantic Zone of Costa Rica and encompasses scale levels that range from field to region. SOLUS consists of technical coefficient generators to quantify inputs and outputs of production systems, a linear programming model that selects production systems by optimizing regional economic surplus, and a geographic information system. Biophysical and economic disciplines are integrated and various types of knowledge, ranging from empirical expert judgement to deterministic process models are synthesized in a systems-analytical manner. Economic sustainability indicators include economic surplus and labor employment, and biophysical ones include soil N, P and K balances, biocide use and its environmental impact, greenhouse gas emission and nitrogen leaching loss and volatilization. Land use scenarios can be implemented by varying properties of production inputs (e.g., prices), imposing sustainability restrictions in the optimization, and incorporating alternative production systems based on different technologies. Examples of application of SOLUS in the Northern Atlantic Zone of Costa Rica show that introduction of alternative technologies may result in situations that satisfy both economic as well as biophysical sustainability. On the other hand, negative trade-offs were found among different dimensions of biophysical sustainability themselves. (C) 1994 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

ID AUSTRALIA
AB Litter decomposition plays a major role in the cycling of energy and nutrients in woodland ecosystems. The rates of leaf litter decomposition and the resulting nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus) release were monitored over a 12-month period for Eucalyptus brookerana and two types of E botryoides leaf litter under one population density trial of eucalypt short rotation forests. The results showed that the tree density had Little influence on the rates of litter decomposition and nitrogen release, but had a significant effect on phosphorus release. The higher the population density, the slower the release. The total nitrogen and phosphorus retention in the Litter increased at first, particularly for phosphorus under the highest tree density (9803 trees ha(-1)). There were significant differences between the rates of both litter decomposition and nutrient release among the three studied leaf litter types. Litter dry weight loss and nutrient release were faster from E. brookerana litter than from E. botryoides litter. Autumn was the main season for litter decomposition and nutrient release. Overall, short rotation forests should be managed rationally based on the fluctuation of litter decomposition, and nutrient cycling in the system to ensure a sustainable production system of land use.

ID TALL FESCUE; QUALITY; FORAGE; YIELD
AB Low-cost alternatives to hay feeding for wintering the beef herd (Bos taurus L.) are needed to design sustainable production systems for northern Appalachia. This study was conducted to compare forage production, quality, and botanical composition of hayfields overseeded with a legume when grazed by beef cattle in early spring and late fall. Four management systems were applied to fields containing either tall fescue [Festuca arundinacea Schreb.] or orchardgrass [Dactylis glomerata L.], each overseeded with red clover [Trifolium pratense L.]: (i) early spring grazing, one hay cutting, late fall grazing (GHG); (ii) two hay cuttings (HH); (iii) early spring grazing followed by two hay cuttings (GHH); and (iv) one hay cutting followed by grazing in late fall (HG). Total dry matter (DM) was highest for the HC management, Early spring grazing (GHH and GHG) reduced spring hay yield; quality, however, as indicated by crude protein, acid-detergent fiber, and in vitro de matter disappearance, was higher than for hay not grazed in spring (HH and KG). Fall grazing increased qualify of forage grazed in early spring. Tall fescue produced more DM than orchardgrass. primarily in spring hay yield. Red clover contributed 50% of the DM of spring hav in the first year after seeding. Fall grazing extended the life of the red clover by one year; however, almost no red clover persisted into the fourth rear after seeding. Results suggest that fall grazing after a single hay cutting has the potential to be a viable alternative to exclusively relying on hay for wintering the beef herd.

AB Introduction: The purpose of this research is to examine the state-of-the-art in community health report card development and use in order to increase their effective integration into community health improvement efforts.
   Methods: A mailed survey was sent to 115 "report card" communities nationwide. This list was generated through multiple key informants at the national, regional, and state levels. Seventy-four percent (85/115) were eligible for the study. The report cards returned were inventoried for: quality of their data, comprehensiveness, presentation, appropriateness to target audiences, purpose and sponsorship, relevance to policy development, community involvement, comparability, replicability, and other factors.
   Results: Of the 85 eligible projects, 65 responded. The report cards varied significantly in all areas. Only one half of communities used pre-existing formats or the experience of others to guide this resource-intensive development process. Data collection was the greatest challenge encountered in development. Local health departments, hospitals, and nonprofit civic groups were the community groups most likely to be involved in development.
   Conclusion: There is need for infrastructure, technical assistance, and improved, easy-to-use tools to facilitate the report card development process and the sharing of expertise and experience among involved communities. Greater systematization of the process would enhance the reasonableness and sustainability of the effort. Broad community involvement, including support of the local health department, other community agencies, as well as the local business community, may be key to their success.

AB Recycled wastewater is a valuable resource in the water-limited economies of the Mediterranean Basin. Increased demands from the domestic and industrial sectors in recent years cause the diversion of fresh water from the customary agricultural uses, while at the same time demand for quality food production by irrigated agriculture increases. Reuse of water after their reclamation is an economically and environmentally desirable solution to resolve these conflicting demands. Large-scale reuse of water for irrigation should be done with full knowledge of potential difficulties, however. Careful treatment of the water and proper management of soils and crops is essential to ensure the long-term sustainability of irrigated agriculture based on reclaimed water. Major limitations and constraints on the reuse of reclaimed sewage water include the biological and chemical quality aspects. The removal of pathogenic entities is a primary and immediate requirement. The careful monitoring and treatment of the chemical pollutants in reclaimed wastewater is essential to maintain the long-term stability of the environment in general, and the agricultural production system, in particular.

AB This paper considers the debate in the UK and the USA on some economists' claims that improving energy efficiency will lead to a greater energy consumption (than would have otherwise occurred), a concept termed the Khazzoom-Brookes postulate. It analyses the criticisms of this claim and of the responses, particularly of the concept of 'dematerialization'. The paper attempts to tackle the paucity of empirical evidence in the UK by looking at long term trends in efficiency and use with respect to UK public lighting. Finally, it focuses on the views of two economists, namely Len Brookes and William Rees, who both accept the postulate but have differing views and policies on measures to reduce carbon emissions from fossil fuels. Brookes believes in free-market solutions, whereas Rees puts forward a vision of a sustainable future based on ecological tax-reform and reafforestation. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

ID HAZARD; FUTURE
AB The Baro-Akobo river basin in southwestern Ethiopia is rich in freshwater resources. In 1984, the government initiated resettlement activities in the basin in anticipation of exploiting the fertile soil and abundant water resources. In order to investigate the causes of post-resettlement floods and their effects on the natural resources, agricultural land and human settlements, field studies and hydrological observations were made during the years 1986, 1988, 1991, 1991 and 1996. It was found that agriculture, both cultivation and grazing land, and human settlements are affected by adverse floods. Abnormal floods in the area are associated with two natural factors-overflow of river banks beyond the normally flooded zones and rainfall storms and their subsequent passage through the drainage system; and also human interference within the catchment due to the absence of proper land use planning. The rapidly growing population can neither divert water to the agricultural fields during drought nor prevent the floods from eroding the region's soil resources. In addition, drinking water of appropriate quantity or quality is not available. It is suggested that environmentally sustainable land use systems and proper utilization of rivers, the introduction of flood amelioration strategies and flood forecasting are all urgently needed for the lower Baro-Akobo river basin.

   microbial activity; indicators; physical properties
AB Soil quality changes resulting from repeated or single injection of liquid municipal sewage sludge were evaluated in terraced cropland in eastern Nebraska, USA. Differences in soil properties among sampling locations were explained primarily by two factors, landscape position and sludge injection. Selected chemical properties (pH, EC, NO3-N) did not generally differ between landscape positions, but soil organic matter (organic C and N) and microbial activity indices (soil respiration, biomass N, available N, mineralization and nitrification rates) were more sensitive indicators of change. Values of these indicators generally increased down-slope from the upper terrace to the grassed waterway on a west facing slope. A probable similar pattern on the east slope was obscured by repeated application of sludge. Single or repeated (long-term) sludge injection increased the readily decomposable organic matter, ammonium- and available-N in soil (0-30.5 cm depth). These changes stimulated soil microbial activity as evidenced by increased basal respiration, net mineralization and nitrification rates, Consequently, nitrification of ammonium-N was reflected in soil chemical properties as increased soil nitrate-N (to levels that were more than two times higher than sufficiency levels for corn) and EC and by decreased pH. In-field measurements detected changes in physical properties such as a decrease of infiltration rate caused by sludge injection and soil compaction as a result of traffic operations. Differences between the sites of single and repeated sludge injection were found in soil pH. ammonoim-N, organic matter and microbial activity. Recent sludge injection resulted in higher ammonium-N concentration and higher microbial activity in soil, and repeated sludge injection resulted in lower pH and in greater organic matter content. Regardless of these differences in soil properties between the sites of single and repeated sludge application, the overall changes that were caused by sludge injection had both positive and negative effects on soil quality and the sustainability of this management practice. Increase of organic matter content and biological activity improved soil fertility, but excessive amounts of ammonium salts contained in liquid sludge resulted in soil nitrification, excessive nitrate formation and acidification. These processes reduce soil productivity, increase the risk of ground- and surface-water contamination and pose a threat to plant and animal health. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB 1. Llangorse Lake is a relatively recent feature of the landscape-a product of Late Quaternary glaciation. It is a relict of proglacial 'Lake Llangors', whose water level was once 37 m higher than that of the present lake.
   2. Palaeolimnological studies indicate that the lake basin started to infill with lacustrine clay in the Late Devensian, in a cold, steppe-tundra environment. An interlude of relative warmth (the Windermere Interstadial) may have prompted accumulations of lake marl, before renewed clay sedimentation in the Loch Lomond Stadial. In a period of increased warmth in the early Holocene, catchment soils stabilized, and an organic autochthonous nekron mud accumulated slowly in central areas, whilst marl deposits accumulated in the northern margins.
   3. Sediment later accumulated faster, apparently after Neolithic and Bronze Age activity in the catchment led to an increased proportion of allochthonous material. A major change occurred in late Iron Age/Roman times; after which sedimentation in the central troughs has principally been of red-brown silty clay, eroded from the catchment.
   4. In the eastern trough, nearer the principal inflow stream, ca 4 m of silty clay has accumulated in the past 2000 years. The water depth has shallowed to some ca 7-9 m in the deeper parts, compared with > 20 m after deglaciation, and ca 15 m at the start of the Holocene. (These figures exclude field evidence for the lake having been considerably larger, with much higher lake level, early in its history.)
   5. Several lines of evidence show that the rate of infill has accelerated: in the eastern basin 90 cm of sediment has accumulated within the last 300 years, of which the top ca 65 cm (including less-compacted recent sediment) accumulated in <150 years. Unless input of allochthonous sediment is curtailed, the lake will become too shallow to be sustainable over the remainder of the Holocene. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Western Australia's Ord River Irrigation Scheme has been controversial since its establishment more than twenty-Jive years ago. A substantial expansion of the scheme, known as Ord Stage Two, is currently underway as a joint project of the Western Australian and Northern Territory governments. In this study I examine and compare Stages One and Two in the context of the significant social and economic changes that have occurred during this period focusing on attitudes to, and conceptualisations of, nature and the human place in it. Despite a context in which consideration of both Aboriginal and environmental issues is now integrated into the development process, three colonial themes persist in the rhetoric of Stage Two. These are the empty landscape, the invisible Aborigine, and the idealisation of agricultural land use. When expressed together these three help to naturalise the development process as both inevitable and strategically implemented. The contradictions inherent in this process enhance existing doubts about the social and ecological sustainability of continuing attempts to 'develop' Australia's north.

ID IMPOVERISHMENT
AB Rural modernisation based on the concept of the Green Revolution has changed the social and ecological landscape in Brazil, particularly since the late 1960s. The expansion of extensive cattle ranching and mechanised agriculture have been major driving forces in this transformation process. In the Midwest, one of the last frontier regions in Brazil, extensive savanna land has recently been cleared for cash-crop production and pasture land. After the displacement of indigenous people during early confrontations with Portuguese explorers in the eighteenth century, we are now witnessing the dispossession of traditional small-scale farmers who had settled in the region two centuries ago. Rural communities have remained marginalised and powerless in the face of pressure and impact from recent development of agribusiness and cattle ranching. The agricultural activity of the smallholders is subsistence-oriented with little market integration, and their production system (shifting cultivation) is based on local knowledge, which seems to be well adapted to the savanna environment. The system is no longer sustainable. Due to capitalist expansion and prevailing conditions of unsecured land tenure, lack of access to basic assets, and high population pressure on scarce resources, the peasants have had to intensify production. This research focuses on the consequences of recent social, economic and environmental change in traditional rural communities.

TI The political sustainability of European Monetary Union
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
ID UNITED-STATES; LEGITIMACY; EMU; COUNTRIES; DEMOCRACY; CURRENCY; LESSONS
AB This article synthesizes a large body of work in applied economics on the likely effects of European Monetary Union with an established literature in political science on the political sustainability of intervention by central or federal authorities in the economies of diverse nations, states or regions. Three possible economic scenarios resulting from EMU are identified - fiscal centralization, monetary discipline and loose money. The greatly enhanced central role implied by the first two would be difficult to legitimize in the context of the absence of a European citizen identity or party system. Historical precedent suggests that, in democracies, both central redistribution in social spending and retrenchment of established social programmes are facilitated by jurisdiction-wide political parties. The loose money scenario, while viable in most member states, would be unlikely to be acceptable in Germany. The article concludes, therefore, that all three scenarios most often predicted by the economics literature carry with them a risk that they will be difficult to sustain politically.

AB The human population is rapidly urbanizing leading many observers to conclude that humans are leaving nature and the countryside behind. This is a perceptual error consistent with the technological optimism inherent in the prevailing expansionist cultural worldview. By contrast, ecological analysis reveals that modem cities are actually increasingly dependent on the goods and services of nature. This fact is merely obscured by technology and urbanization itself. Typical high-income cities appropriate the productive and assimilative capacity of a vast and increasingly global hinterland, resulting in an "ecological footprint' several hundred times larger than the areas they physically occupy. In the next 27 years, the urban population alone is expected to grow by the equivalent of the total human population in the 1930s. This will double the 1970s urban presence on the Earth. Unfortunately, the conventional development path is biophysically unsustainable, calling for a radical transformation of our thinking about urban form and function. Buildings account for 40% of the materials and about a third of the energy consumed by the world economy. Combined with ecocity design principles, green building technologies therefore have the potential to make an enormous contribution to a required 50% reduction in thr? energy and material intensity of consumption globally: The needed dematerialization increases-to 90% in the high-income countries. Such enormous gains m material productivity are unlikely in the absence of significant ecological fiscal (tax) reform. Ironically, then, the most effective path to green buildings and ecocities may be intensive lobbying for higher taxes on primary energy and materials.

DE Green Building Challenge; environmental assessment methods; sustainable
   development; labelling; design tools; feedback
AB The intentions for, and the thinking behind, the Green building Challenge (GBC) assessment framework and its development are made explicit, This paper disentangles three separate relies for environmental assessment of buildings (stimulating owners to improve a building's performance, informing decision makers during the design stages and delivering objective measurements of a building's impact on natural systems). The author provides a number of significant lessons from the development exercise and discusses further implications and directions for developing environmental assessment methods for buildings. A distinction is made between 'green' and 'sustainable' agendas and their implications for the future development of building environmental assessment methods. This is essential in order to clarify the many roles and applications demanded of these tools. The considerable practical overlap between the 'green' and 'sustainable' agendas suggests that they can be reconciled within a single tool. 'Green' performance is most usefully described in relative terms in comparison to similar buildings in the region, while absolute energy and mass flows are a prerequisite for assessing progress to wards sustainability. A fewer number of carefully elected performance measures are required to provide a measure of a building's role in ecological sustainability than to describe its green performance. The GBC process has clarified the roles and applications demanded of different tools and these lessons will be integrated into the restructuring and application of GBTool, and add significantly to the wider debate on environmental assessment.

AB This paper reports on experiences from the Swedish participation in Green Building Challenge '98 and ongoing similar work in Sweden. It argues against very simplified environmental assessment methods and recommends, as far as possible, calculation of environmental effects caused by buildings during their life cycle. participation in the development of the GBC tool provided a broad view of the issues, clarified different opinions in a new field and provided additional stimulation while developing our national assessment methodology, EcoEffect. The environmental assessment of buildings is discussed in relation to the strength and weaknesses of the GBC system. The design and characteristics of 'green buildings' in Sweden is addressed, including ten poster presentations and two case studies presented at GBC '98.

AB The background to and feedback from the UK team on the Green Building Challenge process in the UK is provided along with a commentary on the future development of the environmental assessment of buildings. Unique amongst the GBC national teams, the UK team chose buildings which had undergone post-occupancy evaluation. As a consequence, buildings were evaluated on their design, construction and operation phases. This additional information on actual rather than predicted performance provides a number of important lessons for the environmental assessment of buildings. Future expectations for the development of GBC from the UK perspective include providing proper credit for design features such as lo ru-energy passive cooling and daylighting, modifying the assessment weighting system to provide more reliable comparison or benchmarking between design solutions, providing a practical international assessment method for comparison or benchmarking, incorporating past-occupancy evaluation to validate assessment methods and teals. Ease of use is important and GEC could usefully be simplified to consider the point of application in design, post-design certification and post-occupancy. Environmental assessment of buildings in the future must evolve within a wider context of local Agenda 21 sustainable development criteria.

AB The objectives and achievements of the international Green Building Challenge project are analysed. GBC is situated within the context of other international environmental methods. The differences between assessment tools, design tools, environmental management and audit tools and the large data problems entailed by these are discussed. Possible development scenarios for extending GBC into Life Cycle Assessment methodology, into other life cycle phases (maintenance and refurbishment) and adapting GBC for use with the existing building stocks are proposed. The notion of 'green' buildings is replaced by a larger concept of sustainable development. New aggregation principles and scaleable design methods are proposed. Finally, the question of how relevant the proposed targets of GBC are in relation to the longterm sustainable development of buildings, building stock and urban environments is addressed.

AB This paper is a personal response to the Green Building Challenge '98 conference, held in Vancouver in September 1998. It represents an attempt to link together conceptually - and then comment on critically the two main challenges thrown down at the conference. These were offered at the start and end by Rees and Kohler and were, respectively: (1) that developed countries reduce the environmental impact of their built environment tenfold by 2040 (Rees, 1999: p. 216), and (2) that they stop constructing additional new buildings, limiting themselves instead to improving their existing stock (Kohler, 1999: p. 317). Although not mentioned by Bees or Kohler, both of these challenges could be tackled, for example, through adopting a Service Economy approach to improving the built environment in industrialized countries. This could allow room - in terms of both resources input and pollution output - for the rapid urbanization predicted (and already occurring) in developing countries over the next 30 or 40 years. This paper seeks to locate their challenges in the context of broader initiatives to 'dematerialize' industrial economies. This is done in order to question whether the development of methods for assessing building performance should continue to address the relatively narrow resource-efficiency agenda that has predominated over the past ten years or whether it should now be extended to begin to tackle a wider remit - the sustainability of the built environment.

AB Development of resistance to organophosphorus and carbamate insecticides by the Oriental fruit moth, Grapholita molesta (Busck), has caused great concern regarding the sustainability of peach production in Ontario, Canada. Thus, a resistance management program was implemented and a procedure was developed to monitor for resistance to insecticides in adult moths. Diagnostic concentrations needed to distinguish susceptible genotypes from resistant individuals were determined to be carbofuran (0.1 mu g per vial), carbaryl (1.0 mu g per vial), malathion (0.5 mu g per vial), and cypermethrin (2.5 mu g per vial). Significant survival of field-collected moths to diagnostic concentrations of cypermethrin suggested that resistance to pyrethroids might be widespread. The seasonal patterns of resistance of several Oriental fruit moth populations from the Niagara Peninsula of Ontario indicated a decrease in frequencies of resistance to all insecticides tested from 1996 through 1998. Resistance levels were unstable, thus suggesting that resistance could be successfully managed. Our data confirmed the usefulness of the vial test to monitor for resistance to insecticides in the adult Oriental fruit moth, and provided the basis for the development of a resistance management strategy designed to extend the efficacy of all classes of insecticides used for control.

AB Managing vegetation to achieve ecological, economic, and social goals is difficult. Inherent complexity among ecosystem components and unpredictable climate often limit opportunities for converting cultural inputs to harvestable products. In addition, the long lag time between treatment and financial return makes capital investment in vegetation management economically risky. One tool that can assist land managers in dealing with these constraints is the identification of ecological thresholds and elucidation of processes that signal undesirable change before it is entrained. This approach places a premium on early detection of degrading processes and implementation of management responses in the initial stages of land degradation. Managerial expertise and manipulation of naturally occurring processes, rather than cultural inputs, are key management decisions. In this paper we review current applications of the threshold concept as a management decision point and propose modifications for use in managing plant communities with low potential for annual economic return. We also propose that research and institutional programs for sustainable land management shift direction toward identifying ecological thresholds and focus on developing low-input responses to avoid, rather than restore, land degradation.

AB The novel coupling of methane oxidation and steam reforming via periodic composition forcing can be used to operate a thermally self-sustaining fluidised-bed reactor. The autothermal reaction was carried out over an alumina-supported Co-NiO catalyst. The catalyst exhibited synergism for the steam reforming reaction although extent of synergy decreased from 3.2 at 773 K to 1.4 at 873 K. Analysis of steady-state oxidation and steam reforming rates showed that the bifunctional catalyst would favour H-2 production in a well-mixed reactor at the lowest temperature permissible (773 K). Cycle symmetry, S-OX, has to be greater than 0.3 to achieve thermal self-sustainability. However, time-average rate and H, yield increased with cycle frequency. Interestingly, even at the relatively low H2O:CH4 molar ratio of 1, coking was practically nonexistent probably due to carbon gasification via reaction with O-2 and H2O in the periodically-operated FBR. This investigation shows that the coupling of energetics, kinetics and reactor operation may lead to serendipity in reactor performance. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

SO CHIMICA OGGI-CHEMISTRY TODAY

DT Article
AB Few people would think that the public policy concept of sustainability (also known as sustainable development) is a part of daily business decision-making and practice. Although not usually called such, sustainability considerations taking into account economic, environmental and social factors over the long term - are involved in every business decision by definition. The question to be asked of business is not, "Do you take sustainability into account?" but rather "Do you have a systematic means of ensuring that economic, environmental and social factors for the long term are considered in business decisions?" Asking the question in this way places the rather abstract public policy concept into more actionable business language and processes: A systematic means of factoring sustainability considerations into daily business will ensure that issues of business success, safety, legal compliance, resource use and waste management and society's concerns are property evaluated in business decisions.

AB Surfactants exhibit a protein-denaturating potency which is responsible for water uptake and swelling of the stratum corneum. There is also an increased transepidermal water loss related to the alteration of the barrier function. Ln the present prospective study, we evaluated sodium lauryl sulphate (SLS)-dependent changes in electrometric properties of skin. Single and iterative SLS challenges were performed. Measurements were made using a NOVA DPM on continuous mode for 5 min in order to assess both the baseline surface hydration and the rate of changes during probe occlusion. The present noninvasive instrumental evaluation of surfactant irritancy shows high sensitivity in each subject, but suffers from large inter-individual variability in the skin response following single and iterative sodium lauryl sulphate (SLS) challenges. The baseline surface hydration, that is almost unaffected I h after removing SLS patches, significantly decreases after a lag time of 24 h. The rate of water accumulation in the stratum corneum during the probe occlusion is significantly increased by SLS and is proportional to the SLS concentration and the number of iterative patches. Single water- or SLS-patch-tests fail to predict the skin response to cumulative SLS challenges and interindividual variability is large for all electrometric variables.

AB Cormorants feed by feet-propelled diving, How cormorants optimize foraging is of a particular interest in relation to the understanding of the feeding strategies of diving birds, as well as within the debate about cormorants' impact on sustainable resources. Using microdata loggers that recorded diving depth, we investigated the foraging strategy of males and females of subantarctic cormorants, which inhabit cold regions, and of Japanese cormorants, which live in the northern temperate zone. For both species, males and females daily spent the same amount of time submerged, and apparently captured the same amount of fish. However, males dived deeper and longer, which could be explained by their 15-20 % larger body mass and may minimize potential competition for food. (C) Academie des Sciences / Elsevier, Paris.

AB What are the bases of policy coherence in societies undergoing the simultaneous trans-formations of politics and property? in contrast to the conventional wisdom that unconstrained executives have more authority to carry out reforms, the authors argue in this paper that authority and accountability are not in a trade-off. They make that argument on the basis of a comparative study of several East Central European cases. In the first section below, they sketch in brief some major policy differences in the country cases. The main body of the paper seeks to explain the differences in policy coherence in Germany, Hungary, and the Czech Republic. The concluding section introduces the concept of extended accountability to elaborate a theoretical framework to understand the institutional sources of sustainable policies of economic transformation.

AB Post-Soviet transitions have prompted a search for new policy tools and methods of data collection. The shift from universal welfare provision under the Soviet system to targeted assistance and poverty monitoring has stimulated a new interest in the measurement of living standards and poverty lines. This has promoted the use of quantitative techniques and sample surveys (household surveys, in particular) as privileged tools for the collection of policy-relevant information. This paper contends that survey techniques have particular limitations as research tools in an environment where local level case studies are scarce and where a host of new socio-economic processes are creating fundamental shifts in the landscape of social provision, redistribution and employment. These limitations are illustrated by drawing upon a household survey conducted by the author in four villages from two regions in Uzbekistan, Andijan and Kashkadarya, between October 1997 and August 1998. The ambiguities surrounding five basic concepts, those of household, employment, access to land, income and expenditure are discussed in detail, as are the changes in their contents and meanings in the context of transition. The gender differentiated outcomes of current changes and their possible implications are highlighted throughout the text. The conclusion suggests that Uzbekistan finds itself at an uneasy juncture where the policies deployed to 'cushion' the social costs of transition may reach the limits of their sustainability. A more contextually sensitive approach to the mechanisms that generate new forms of vulnerability and the use of qualitative and longitudinal methodologies are essential to an adequate monitoring of further changes.

AB This paper is a contribution to the continuing development of the methods and results for the Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare, also known as the Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI). It attempts a more systematic approach to some of the components of the GPI. It includes a more careful specification of types of capital and more plausible methods of estimating the costs of depletion of non-renewable resources and environmental damage due to ozone depletion. In addition, the paper attempts a more comprehensive treatment of the value of time, including the costs of unemployment and overwork. Results of the GPI calculations for Australia over the period 1950-1996 are presented and analysed. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

ID SUSTAINABILITY; INDICATORS
AB The contrast between, on the one hand, decreasing emissions of the metals cadmium, copper, lead and zinc and, on the other, their continuously increasing input into the economy is analysed for three case studies: The Netherlands as a whole, the Dutch housing sector and the Dutch agricultural sector. Flows of these metals through and their accumulation within the economy and the environment have been quantified for 1990 and for a constructed steady-state situation. To this end, the substance flow analysis method has been applied. The case studies show that there is a strong increase to be expected in the emissions from the 1990 to the steady-state situation. This increase is mainly due to the shift from landfill accumulation to emission to non-agricultural soil. At the same time, however, there is also an increase in the emissions to other media: air, water and agricultural soil. Emissions along these critical routes with respect to human and ecotoxicity show an approximately 30% increase for cadmium, lead and zinc and more than a doubling for copper. It is shown that this increase may lead to the surpassing of critical levels for human toxicity and terrestrial and aquatic ecotoxicity. Some possible measures are suggested to prevent critical levels being exceeded. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper examines the impact of early market integration on the extraction of forest resources by traditional forest-based households, with emphasis on the commercial-subsistence dichotomy. Empirical analysis of resource use transition among the Huaorani People of the Ecuadorian Amazon shows that as markets become more accessible production patterns change but do not seem to affect subsistence production. Huaoranis increase the production of animal resources from forests. However, the extraction of harvested and primarily of farmed commodities seems not to be affected. Data also suggest that trade relies on limited specialization. Trade among the Huaorani communities studied depends on raising the production of some of the same commodities that are found in the subsistence basket. These changes are clearly explained if a flexible-labor theory of early market integration is used. This period is characterized by labor and land abundance and a relative ease to move labor from low return to more productive activities. Under these conditions, market participation need not be accompanied by a reduction in the production of subsistence commodities or commodity specialization. High risks and uncertainty and high transportation costs keep poor forest households from shifting completely to commercial activities. This contrasts with a long presumption that production of individual commodities responds quickly to price changes, based on demand shifts between products, but that total output is slow to respond. Only after all the surplus labor has been allocated to productive activities total output becomes less flexible. At this point increased production requires commodity or technological specialization.

ID SELECTION FOREST; STOCKING
AB A matrix growth model is estimated on the basis of growth data (growth period 5 years) of 14 measurement plots of uneven-aged white pine from southern Ontario. The impact of three economic factors specific to the private forests on the sustainable management of private woodlots is evaluated and discussed, and the trade-off between environmental and economic values is examined. These three economic factors are: (1) choice of the rate of time preference; (2) income and property taxes; and (3) subsidy for rehabilitation of degraded forests. Property tax, based on market price of land, is neutral, but income tax is not neutral with respect to harvesting decisions, growing stock, environmental and ecological values, and economic values. High rates of time preference and income tax will lead to the conversion of uneven-aged forest into even-aged young forest leading to the loss of ecological and environmental values. As a result of the discrete nature of tree distribution and prices of different size trees, increased income tax rates may not result in higher tax revenue. The fiscal policies need be sensitive to the nature of forests to encourage sustainable management practices on private woodlots. In the case of degraded private woodlots, a subsidy on rehabilitation cost will be desirable in place of property tax subsidy. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The bark of the tree Quillaja saponaria, indigenous to Chile, is one of the major sources of industrially used triterpenoid saponins. For decades quillaja extracts have been used as foaming agents in beverages, emulsifiers in foods, wetting agent in photography, etc. Overexploitation of the bar-h: has caused important ecological damage and a shortage of this resource. However; this can still be remedied by using whole quillaja wood (and not just the bark), for the production of saponins. This uaw material can be obtained in Inr-ge quantities from pruning operations. reducing the need to felt trees. This review covers ecological aspects of quillaja exploitation, as well as a discussion of its novel industrial applications.

DE photovoltaics; solar energy; renewable energy markets
AB There has been an increasing interest in deploying renewable energy technologies as a means of supplying energy needs in a more sustainable manner. This paper describes the recent evolution of the market for solar photovoltaics (PVs) and discusses likely future developments. It provides an overview of the niche markets in which PVs are already competitive with other forms of electricity provision and assessment of the larger markets currently supported by governments, utilities and industry in the expectation that they will become competitive in the future. The paper briefly addresses remaining barriers to the deployment of solar PVs and outlines the principal policy mechanisms being used to foster the development of both the technology and the markets in different countries. The evidence indicates that the PV industry may be on the verge of rapid expansion as economies-of-scale improve production economics, government programmes encourage deployment and more large-scale applications of the technology become viable.

AB This study proposes a methodology for evaluating energy technologies according to their environmental impact, both for the present and future. The methodology emphasizes the use of quantitative data relating to six key parameters: the quality, quantity and renewability of the available energy used and the maintainability, efficiency and sustainability of the end-use technologies. These parameters are incorporated into an original objective function that obtains a value for each of the energy-technology-environment interactions. This methodology was applied to three separate scenarios relating to Mexico's future energy use in order to evaluate the environmental impact of ten end-use technologies. This approach is applicable to any nation or region interested in making informed choices about its energy future. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In a river basin where existing land and water resources are virtually fully exploited, planning for water management in the future becomes a challenging task. A scenario-consequence analysis, based on economic growth forecasts, was applied to assess alternatives for water management. Comparison of the impacts resulting from three growth scenarios provided the local government with a vision of the consequences of selection of each-of the scenarios. It was concluded that a water deficit would result from each scenario. To balance the expectations of the population for better employment and living standards and environmental degradation and to remedy the water deficit situation, a water management plan comprising changes in water policies and institutional arrangements, introduction to water conservation and demand management, pollution control, and importation of water from other river basins was proposed. The sustainability of the water management plan was also discussed.

DE biological phosphorus treatment; hydroxyapatite; phosphorus
   concentration; struvite; sustainability
AB At present the main types of phosphorus removal from wastewater effluents are chemical precipitation using alum or lime and biological removal. These methods of removal do not recycle phosphorus as a truly sustainable product because ii is removed along with various other waste products. The development of phosphorus removal by crystallisation has provided a way of removing phosphorus in a form that has potential to be a raw material for the phosphate industry such as struvite and hydroxyapatite. Through combining biological phosphorus removal and crystallisation a number of benefits in terms of process economics can be made. By treating the effluent initially with a biological process a concentrated phosphorus effluent stream is produced. This concentration of phosphorus will significantly reduce the volume of effluent that needs to be treated which means that the crystallisation reactor size can be greatly reduced. This review describes the main types of commercial biological phosphorus removal technologies such as the Phostrip, the modified Bardenpho and Rotanox processes along with a comprehensive examination of current crystallisation processes. Together with an examination of the potential benefits of using biological removal and crystallisation in combination as a method of removing phosphorus so that it can be recycled.

AB This paper reviews the potential for phosphorus (P) recovery from animal manures as a method of increasing the sustainability of the global P cycle. The P content of animal manures produced annually in the UK is currently estimated at over 120,000 t. This represents approximately twice the annual non-agricultural P requirement in the UK and has an approximate value of pound 76 M. Similar quantities of P are produced in manures in the Netherlands and an estimated 600 500 t are produced annually in the US. Up to 65% of manure P may be associated with an organic moiety. However, current methods to identify these including HPLC and P-31 NMR are under-developed while P fractionation procedures give only operational definitions. Combinations of current technologies developed for the treatment of sewage are likely to prove effective in the recovery of P from manures. Enhanced Biological Phosphorus Removal (EBPR) could he adapted to produce a concentrated P effluent. Recovery of P from which could be achieved by either of two crystallisation pathways to produce magnesium ammonium phosphate (struvite) or calcium phosphate (apatite). Recycling of manure P to land within the agricultural sector remains the best option in many cases. However, manure production in many areas such as Chesapeake Bay and the Everglades in North America, the Po Delta in Italy and the sand regions of the Netherlands is too intensive for locally available land to accommodate without the risk of transfer to surface waters. Legislation restricting recycling of P to land already exists in the Netherlands and is likely to become widely adopted. Under these circumstances recovery of P may alleviate manure management problems.

AB In the search for accessible, understandable, and useful criteria for the evaluation of community sustainability initiatives, quality of life indicators have proven to be appealing. Currently, in Ontario, there are several ongoing efforts to develop quality of life indicators for use at che municipal level. Methodologies useful in rural communities must meet some important challenges, including a lack of small area statistics and an absence of paid staff assistance. This article discusses volunteer-driven efforts by rural Woolwich Township's Healthy Communities Project to develop quality of life indicators for use in developing a local.

AB Old-growth stands can be rare in northern coniferous forests, and hence are worthy of protection and special management. We describe some quantitative guidelines for recognizing old-growth stands and options for maintaining a long-term supply of old-growth values in landscapes managed for timber production. In the Sub-Boreal Spruce forests of central British Columbia, attributes most indicative of old-growth status include stand age, the density of large (>1.0 m(3)) snags and downed logs, stand basal area and volume. It is suggested that partial cutting could occur in some old-growth stands, while still maintaining their structural and functional attributes, if large logs, snags and trees are retained at the threshold densities necessary to recognise old-growth status. At the landscape level, the use of extended timber crop rotations is advocated. Planning for a tapered forest age class distribution (with decreasing areas of forest allowed to persist to successively older ages) is suggested as a means of sustainably generating true old-growth, and as an alternative to the use of partial cutting and patch retention. Arithmetic formulas are developed which provide guidelines for the proportion of the forest land base to be kept in each successive age class. This model for regulating human disturbance in commercial forests holds promise as a mechanism for allowing continued timber harvest and even-aged stand management while retaining a near-natural proportion of old-growth forest in northern landscapes.

AB In Prague, as with many other European historic cities, the growth of tourism has altered perceptions of the cultural meaning of place which is embedded in the built environment. This paper draws on research undertaken to explore the impact of tourism on perceptions of the historic core of that city. Data from surveys of the views of residents and visitors reveal a growing recognition of a number of negative impacts of tourism. These perceptions have far-reaching implications for the continuing success of the historic city centre not only as a place of residence, but also as a tourist destination. Conclusions drawn from the research underline the need for tourism to be managed in a more effective and sustainable way if the character of the historic centre is not to be altered irreversibly.

AB While communism led to rapid structural change with an emphasis on urban and industrial development, the growth of unemployment in Romania, since 1989, has left many rural families dependent on the small farms they have received through land restitution. While viable holdings may emerge over the long term, there is an immediate need for diversification to generate ancillary sources of income. The paper examines this issue in the context of the Romanian Carpathians where rural employment is central to the 'mountainology' programme adopted by the Commission (now Agency) for Mountainous Regions created in 1990. The study concentrates primarily on rural tourism which received strong support from central government and from external sources over recent years. The critical factors for successful development are emphasized, including fiscal incentives, environmental policies and the growth of institutions at all levels.

AB Environmental problems in Poland were highlighted during the 1980s, although discussion of the causes and consequences was discouraged. With the round table meetings and the ending of the communist Government, concern about the environment reached a new high point. Decisions were taken to close certain enterprises which were particularly damaging to the environment, and to try to clear up the damage left by the former regime. However, when the recession of the early 1990s began to bite, public concern about rising unemployment downgraded the environment as an issue, with the result that some of the condemned businesses were reprieved, at least temporarily. In the public sector, work on cleaning up and on remedying deficiencies in infrastructure (such as building municipal sewage works) has proceeded more slowly than might have been expected. This paper surveys the progress made in Poland over the past eight years, and looks at the prospects for sustainable development in the future. Examples are drawn from all over Poland, but with a particular emphasis on the city of Torun.

TI Sustaining the steppes: A geographical history of pastoral land use in

SO GEOGRAPHICAL REVIEW

DE land tenure; land use; Mongolia; nomads; pastoralism
AB Recent shifts in Mongolia's politics and economy have changed pastoral land-use patterns and charged debate over how pasturelands are allocated and regulated in a market economy. Absent has been any detailed understanding of the historical geography of pastoral tenure and land-use patterns in Mongolia prior to the socialist era and the collectivization of livestock husbandry. An overview and case study of changing tenures and land-use patterns suggests that in prerevolutionary Mongolia wealth and poverty determined herders' mobility and access to pasture resources; no less is true today. Historical data also reveal dual formal and informal regulatory institutions extant in the past that coordinated patterns of seasonal movement. This amounted to an unofficial tenure system and has contributed to Mongolidia's legacy of ecologically and socially sustainable pastoralism.

AB Global forest trends are analysed in relation to indicators of economic, social and political development. The richest and most democratic countries are characterised by stable or expanding forests, while poor and despotic countries tend to experience rapid forest loss. The conclusion is that a high level of development is beneficial rather than detrimental to the sustainability of forest area. This conclusion is discussed briefly in relation to the relationship between the human and environmental dimensions of sustainable development. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper considers the nature and extent of housing mobility for a specific population of 'nuclear family' owner occupiers. The aim is to explore what is a frequently overlooked dimension of housing-related disadvantage. It is suggested that the concept of disadvantage would be rendered more meaningful if it were extended to fake account of differential opportunities and constraints within as well as between a variety of household employment structures. The ways in which households generate and reproduce gender divisions of labour represent a synthesis of the negotiation of home, work and family life and, consequently, access to and sustainability of particular streams of housing amenity and resources. Moreover, when household employment structure is recognised as a key determinant of housing mobility it can be appreciated that processes which underpin the 'flow' of household structure also serve to reinforce significant cleavages between households. This relationship, between relative housing mobility and different household employment structures, is described in terms of observations from two sets of complementary micro-data from the Census of Population.

AB Lake Tanganyika hosts one of the largest inland fisheries in Africa and is a significant source of food and livelihood to millions dwelling inside and outside of its basin. The lake and its environs support a wide array of subsistence and commercial activity as well as a remarkable assemblage of tropical flora and fauna, including highly diverse populations of endemic fish. This paper describes efforts undertaken through the FAO/FINNIDA Lake Tanganyika Research Project (LTR) to investigate the lake's production and potential and to advise on modalities for the optimal management of its resources, in order to serve present and future human welfare and conservation needs. Specifically, the paper essays to: (a) provide background on the scope and content of LTR Project work; (b) situate project research and methodologies in terms of contemporary developments in fisheries management theory and application; (c) identify and characterise, with reference to research outcomes generated through the project's Scientific Sampling Programme, socio-economic investigations and legal-institutional studies, major development and management challenges that confront fisheries resource users, administrators, planners, and policy makers; and finally, (d) consider various policy options appropriate to conditions of ecosystem uncertainty, plural stakeholder interests and complex interactions between fishing and non-fishing sectors of the wider economy. It is argued that the Lake Tanganyika situation defies diagnosis and prescription according to conventional `stock assessment driven' management thinking. The lake instead presents a compelling case for the application of multi-disciplinary management approaches, involving strong levels of community participation.

AB The pelagic cyprinid dagaa plays a crucial role in the disrupted ecosystem of Lake Victoria. It is the main utilizer of zooplankton, a major prey for the introduced Nile perch and, after Nile perch, economically the second-most important species in the fishery. Light fishery for dagaa was started in the 1960s and boosted during the 1980s. In spite of an intensified exploitation by man, Nile perch and piscivorous birds, the dagaa population increased significantly. Spatial and temporal distribution patterns of dagaa and its potential predators restricted the harvestable fraction of the dagaa stock mainly to mature fish. An increase in recruitment to the reproducing part of the population and a reduction in generation time enhanced the prospects for a sustainable fishery. However, a recent increase in the use of mosquito seines forms a potential danger for the fishery, since dagaa seems to use the inshore waters as spawning areas and nurseries.

AB The general public in many countries throughout the world has become increasingly cynical about the extent to which large companies have engaged in genuine attempts to reduce their impact on the environment. As the century draws to a close, stake holders are becoming even more demanding and are now insisting that companies help lead society into a new more sustainable age. How have companies responded to this challenge! To what extent is industry's poor reputation warranted! And how far have companies gone in wrestling with their environmental and social responsibilities! This article draws on some quantitative research as well as statements made by business leaders in assessing the extent to which genuine greening has taken hold within the business community. Some tentative conclusions are also offered, suggesting that some significant progress has been made, but that even more significant challenges remain for industry to grapple with.

TI Social movements and the globalisation of environmental governance
SO IDS BULLETIN-INSTITUTE OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
AB Environmental governance has become globalised as part of a wider agenda of global governance building within key institutions such as the World Trade Organisation (WTO). The perceived need for global solutions to global environmental problems and calls for sustainable development have put environmental issues onto the agenda of the institutions of global governance, which, some argue, are becoming democratised through consultation with global civil society This sphere of global civil society, however, is not unproblematic, hosting a diversity of actors such as social movements, business and industry who are clearly not on an equal footing. This article focuses on social movements attempts to influence the international trade agenda, but also takes a look at radical grassroots resistance movements that do not fit easily within this sphere. Their calls for structural transformation of the WTO highlight the lack of democracy and accountability within the WTO that will not be remedied merely through consultation with global civil society.

SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON ELECTRONICS

DT Article
DE GaAs MESFET; power amplifier; hot-electron reliability
AB Tradeoffs between efficiency, power and reliability were analyzed for the GaAs MESFETs with variable recess structures. The MESFET process can be optimized for either best power/efficiency performance or best reliability by varying the width of the first recess. If the first recess width is increased by 0.4 mu m, an estimated order of magnitude increase in device lifetime, limited by hot-electron-induced degradation, can be achieved at the expense of 3% in power-added efficiency and 20 mW/mm in output power. The reported hot-electron reliability highlights include maximum sustainable reverse gate current stress of 100 mA/mm and (Stress) x (Lifetime) figure of merit of 12.5 A.hr/cm which advances the present state of the art by approximately an order of magnitude. The introduced (Stress)x(Lifetime) figure of merit is essential for design-for-reliability of high efficiency power amplifiers.

AB The development of the passion fruit production industry in Uganda has been seriously hindered by the outbreak of collar rot disease. Until now, no appropriate control measures have been developed. Therefore, a study was initiated to develop a sustainable, environment-friendly collar rot control package. The potential of chemical control was assessed. Chemical control was found to be economical only in the case of copper oxychloride applied as a drench at a rate of 60 g/20 l of water. Other fungicides tested were Rovral 70 WP (iprodione) and Cercobin 50 L (thiophanate methyl). To address the environmental issue, use of resistant species was investigated. Two species, Passiflora edulis f. flavicarpa and P. maliformis were found to be partially resistant to collar rot, and can be recommended for use as rootstocks to susceptible P. edulis f. edulis and hybrid clones.

TI The Global Economic Crisis, Contagion, and Institutions: New realities

SO INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
AB This article uses the current economic crisis in Asia to analyze the impact that economic turmoil-especially economic contagion-in emerging markets can have on the process of social, political, and economic institutionalization and reform in Asia and Latin America. It argues that continued financial instability will result in increased democratization and transparency in Asia, as has happened in Latin America as a result of its struggles to consolidate and reconcile democratization and economic reform from the late 1980s to today. This transformation in Asia will temper the argument that the Asian development model was the path Latin America should have followed. This does not mean, however, that the reform path that the Asian countries choose will be successful or certain. Rather, although many authoritarian tenets of the Asian model will be challenged by calls for political and economic reform, the ultimate degree of liberalization in Asia will be uneven and incomplete, especially if the economic crisis deepens. Conversely, Latin American nations will need to use the Asian crisis as further evidence that the most sustainable form of economic and political reform necessitates a renewed commitment to promoting democracy and liberal institutions.

AB With ecological globalization, environmental degradation has become a phenomenon capable of accentuating not only the sources of spatial and temporal conflicts, but also inter- and intragenerational inequities. In this context, it seems important, first of all, to explain the ways in which the taking into account of inter-generational equity in our societies' decisions constitutes a new challenge posing unresolved questions for decisionmakers. Secondly, we see that the implementation of effective policies for sustainable development (that is, taking real account of the long-term and of equity concerns), requires the development of new perspectives and practices in science and of new "governance" institutions capable of responding to these new challenges. Thirdly, we show that these changes imply, for economic analysis and the advice that can be offered by economists, a shift from a substantive rationality perspective towards a procedural rationality. This latter encourages the development of new analysis and decision support tools based on a wider sharing of information and efforts at reconciling different perspectives in the assessment of risks and equity concerns. This new rationality will be expressed as a process of debate and dialogue taking place continuously in all phases of the policy process.

AB Current conceptualizations of environmental responsibility follow a human-centered approach wherein the natural environment is seen as instrumental to human ends. Environmental responsibility, in this context, emerges primarily as the preservation and sustenance of nature in a manner that would limit waste, enhance the aesthetic and spiritual value of nature, and confer psychological and economic rewards upon individuals and businesses that follow a sustainable course of interaction with nature. In contrast, this paper advances an ecocentric approach to sustainable living that ensures the dialectic between human systems and natural and technical systems by explicitly recognizing nature as central to survival and progress. Environmental responsibility within this approach is viewed to be multilateral and institutional rather than merely as moral responsibility of business or of governments.

DE sustainable land management; environmental indicators; critical values
AB While the importance of the concept of the sustainability of land management practices is now widely accepted, there remains considerable debate on methods of identifying sustainability. This paper proposes a series of criteria which can be used to select indicators for assessing the sustainability of land management systems. 'Sustainable land management' is defined using the five objectives of productivity, security, protection, viability and acceptability. The paper introduces the concept of 'areas of concern : which are defined as any factor able to influence the ability of a production system to meet the five objectives of sustainable land management Environmental indicators used to monitor areas of concern must be sensitive to management actions and must be related in a functional way with those parts of the system which may be at risk. Indicators must have identified critical values beyond which a particular system of land management is no longer sustainable. Critical values for indicators often depend on an understanding of the mechanisms which control the relationships between management and the final arbiter of sustainability. Critical values may vary depending on the characteristics of the system but will be independent of management although management will influence the rate at which an indicator approaches its critical value. It is argued that the criteria used to select biophysical indicators can also be used for selecting indicators of the economic, social and commercial aspects of sustainability.

AB Research with loblolly pine suggests that projected increases iii atmospheric CO2 concentration will accelerate early growth and could result in shouter rotation length, reduced time until first commercial thinning, higher optimal planting density, and possibly higher maximum stocking level in managed stands. We discuss some of the physiological processes and stand dynamics that underlie these changes, as well as silvicultural strategies that may serve to ensure sustainability of intensively managed forest systems in the face of increasing CO2 and possible climate change.

TI Money and the semiotics of eco system dissolution
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE
LA English
DT Article
DE Cartesian dualism; economic anthropology; human ecology; materialism;
   modernity; money; semiotics; sustainability
AB This paper argues for a semiotic approach to the problematic interface of economics and ecology. It begins by tracing the origins of materialist science and discussing strategies for transcending Cartesian dualism in the study of human ecology. It then discusses pre-modernity, modernity and postmodernity as transformations of semiotic relations with implications for identity and culture as well as human-environmental relations. The phenomenon of money is identified as a vehicle and epitome of the processes of semiotic abstraction we know as modernity. Various analogies between money and language are scrutinized and rejected. The tendencies of money to dissolve cultural and natural systems are understood as two aspects of a single, ecosemiotic process. Finally, a very general suggestion is offered as to how the idea and institution of money could be transformed so as to check the continued devastation of the biosphere.

AB The United Kingdom-South Africa Sports Initiative was launched in 1994 to contribute to a sustainable and equitable sports development system in South Africa. The initiative was implemented in two phases. Phase I entailed planning and developing a national sports administration curriculum. In Phase II, planning was finalized and resources were provided for the development of a sports delivery system, and the program was monitored to identify (a) problems, constraints, and challenges; (b) solutions; and (c) an implementation plan. Coordinators (n = 5), lead facilitators (n = 2), facilitators (n = 10), and sports leaders (n = 9) were interviewed, and statistics were compiled on their race and gender. The conclusion of Phase II entailed monitoring different aspects of the sports leaders' course. The main trends identified through that process include the context, aims and objectives, style of presentation, and content of courses at different levels. Perceptions about ownership, management, and the possible impact of the initiative are discussed.

ID AUTOMATIC DIFFERENTIATION
AB An optimization model for selecting and sizing potential reservoir and hydropower plant sites on river basins is presented. The model improves on the work of Lall and Miller by replacing the modified sequent peak algorithm for sizing reservoirs with a behavior analysis algorithm that allows operation of the reservoir system with realistic operating policies. A heuristic simulation procedure is used to assess the feasibility of developing self-sustainable hydropower plants at each site. A gradient (derivative) based optimization algorithm is employed to integrate these simulations into an optimal screening model. To enhance the efficiency of the algorithm, the approximate and expensive approach of evaluating derivatives by divided differences is replaced by automatic differentiation. A comparison of the computational performance shows that the optimal solution with automatic differentiation is obtained four times faster than with the divided difference method. The model is developed in the context of river basins in India.

AB This paper forms the introduction to a special issue of this journal entitled 'Environmental Histories, Access to Resources and Landscape Change', that poses challenges to the ways in which the multiple dimensions of resource degradation are understood, analyzed and acted upon in developing countries. The paper outlines a framework for understanding the complexity of land degradation processes, their impacts, and offers insights into their remediation. The framework builds on the work of regional political ecologists, It involves a widened conception of resource degradation; an explicit awareness of layered scales of analysis in both time and space; an emphasis on the mechanisms structuring and determining patterns of access to a range of resources that influence the use of the natural environment; an engagement with environmental history; and a sensitivity to the relevance and application of research effort.

AB To arrest processes of resource degradation, researchers and activists increasingly advocate community-based approaches, which recognize local tenure rights and devolve management responsibilities to local communities. But de jure community control does not necessarily eliminate the problem. In Mexico, more than 70 percent of remaining forests are the common properties of thousands of rural communities. During most of this century, however, custodial forest management policies and concessions to large industries alienated local people from using their forests or participating in their conservation. This led to forest degradation and deforestation through the concessionaire's high-grading and the timber smuggling and land conversion carried on by members of excluded communities. Since the 1980s, a community-based alternative has arisen, in which communities manage their own logging enterprises operating in their communal forests. In a case-study community, benefits from forestry increased dramatically after community control and forest management improved. But severe problems remain, including corruption and the concentration of forestry benefits among a local elite, and forest-degrading timber smuggling among many commoners. These problems reflect an imbalance of power in the community and weakened common property institutions. This situation contrasts with seven other forestry communities that maintain communal accountability over logging businesses, better distribution of the benefits and restrictions of resource management, and internally legitimate control over timber smuggling and unsanctioned clearing. A comparison of the history and institutional characteristics of these communities suggests that parallel policies of institutional investment and capacity building will enhance the success of community-based approaches to reversing processes of resource degradation.

TI Urban intensification policies in England: problems and contradictions
SO LAND USE POLICY
LA English
DT Article
DE urban intensification; consolidation; density; planning policy
AB This paper is a review of the problems and contradictions inherent in land use policies aimed at delivering urban intensification in England. Urban intensification is seen in land use planning as a way of delivering sustainable development: it optimises the use of previously developed land, reduces travel demand and revitalises and repopulates cities. However, by drawing on existing research and data some contradictions and complexities within both the content of intensification policies and their means of implementation are revealed. The paper reviews the origins of, and theory behind, compact city policies. It then illustrates how urban intensification policies have been included in planning policy in England, and reflects on the divergence between theory and practice. The aim of the paper, in revealing weaknesses in intensification policies, is not to discredit the compact city idea, but to draw attention to potential policy failures in order to identify issues which need to be addressed by policy-makers, implementers and researchers.

TI Environmental management of ports and harbours - implementation of
   policy through scientific monitoring
SO MARINE POLICY

DE port; environment; management; monitoring
AB Recent legislation aimed specifically at protecting the marine environment has had a direct impact on the environmental management of port and harbour operations. Effective implementation of suitable policies requires options and responses based on scientific data derived from appropriate technology and methodology. UK ports, operating under an increasingly European regime in terms of legislation, have responded to the environmental challenge through a series of organisational and research initiatives. Fundamental to the notion of sustainable port development is the ability to characterise environmental performance through appropriate monitoring and mapping protocols. Monitoring, the systematic and repeated measurement of the direct or indirect effect of our activity or contaminant on the environment, can play a crucial role in verifying implementation of port policy and evaluating the effectiveness of the management option. Aspects such as adherence to specific regulatory standards, investigation of pollution trends, provision of research data, measurements for the development of standards and early warning of critical changes in certain parameters are all facilitated by an appropriate monitoring protocol. The long established techniques of monitoring physical and chemical parameters to assess environmental quality are increasingly being supplemented by ecological monitoring programmes. By mapping marine habitats with their associated communities and species, the vulnerability and sensitivity of the habitats to port operations can be found and biological indicators such as the occurrence of particular species, species richness and diversity indices can be identified to assist decision making on environmental protection issues.

AB With the support of the nonprofit agency World Wildlife Fund, our government research center in northwestern Mexico focused the efforts of 26 investigators on two important biodiversity conservation projects. Over the course of three years, interdisciplinary teams of researchers from the Northwest Biological Research Center of Baja California Sur collaborated with World Wildlife Fund to obtain baseline information in support of conservation plans for Sierra de La Laguna in Baja California Sur and Archipielago de Revillagigedo off the coast of Mexico. The collaborative research and planning resulted in the establishment, by presidential decree, of two biosphere reserves. Our research center benefited from these efforts, particularly through the integration of multidisciplinary teams working together in Northwest Mexico. Our center's human and economic resources were optimally utilized during these three years. Results of the studies-published in 2 book-length reports, 42 scientific papers, and 12 executive reports to the Mexican governmental authorities-are being used to establish specific measures to protect and sustainably manage both biosphere reserves. We hope that collaborative efforts between Mexican research centers and international nonprofit agencies will continue in the future, and that they will occur in other countries. Such optimal allocation of resources will further the cause of biodiversity conservation.

AB Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) is critically involved in the pathogenesis of several chronic inflammatory diseases. Monoclonal antibodies against TNF-alpha are currently used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease. This report describes a simple and effective method for active immunization against self TNF-alpha. This vaccination approach leads to a T-cell-dependent polyclonal and sustainable anti-TNF-alpha autoantibody response that declines upon discontinuation of booster injections. The autoantibodies are elicited by injecting modified recombinant TNF-alpha molecules containing foreign immunodominant T-helper epitopes. In mice immunized with such molecules, the symptoms of experimental cachexia and type II collagen-induced arthritis are ameliorated. These results suggest that vaccination against TNF-alpha may be a useful approach for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and other chronic inflammatory diseases.

AB Motorsport is a term used to cover a wide variety of sporting disciplines involving two-, three-, or four-wheel vehicles. This paper addresses one of these disciplines-motor racing, which involves vehicles with four wheels racing on the six permanent tracks (circuits) in New Zealand, These events are run according to the rules and regulations of the recognised governing body for motor racing in new Zealand, MotorSport New Zealand inc, Motorsport noise emission is a delicate balance between retaining our viewing public and reasonable noise compliance. Since there are no laws governing the amount of sound a person can receive by choice, MotorSport throughout the late '70s and early '80s conducted a range of tests to attempt to strike a balance between the need for workable noise emission regulations and public entertainment. As a result of this earlier planning, regulations were introduced in 1987 in a format that remains largely unchanged today, The key issues addressed by the regulations were: (1) method of measurement on site; (2) method of check measurement off site; (3) establishing a sustainable maximum level of emission; (4) spectator retention; and (5) cost controls, (C) 1999 Institute of Noise Control Engineering.

AB Organic materials are the most important sources of nutrients for agricultural production in farming systems of semi-arid West Africa. However, reliance on locally available organic nutrient sources for both crop and livestock production is rapidly becoming unsustainable. A series of feeding and agronomic trials have been conducted to address the role of livestock in sustainable nutrient cycling. This paper reports results of a greenhouse study that evaluated the effects of applying crop residue and browse leaves, or feces derived from these feeds, at equal organic-N application rates (150 kg ha(-1)), alone or with fertilizer-N (60 kg ha(-1)), on pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum [L.] R.Br.) dry matter (DM) yield, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) uptake, on soil nutrients, and on total, labile and recalcitrant fractions of soil organic matter (SOM). Millet DM and cumulative N uptake were most affected by fertilizer-N, followed by plant species and amendment type, although various interactions among these treatments were noted due to variations in the composition of the applied amendments. Fertilizer-N increased total millet DM by 39%, N uptake by 58% and P uptake by 17%, and enhanced N mineralization from most organic amendments, but was applied insufficiently to totally offset N and P immobilization in pots containing leaves of low initial N and P content. Feces alone appeared to supply sufficient N to meet millet-N demands. Nitrogen use efficiency was, in most cases, higher in pots amended with feces than with leaves. Nitrogen in feces apparently mineralized more in synchrony with millet-N demands. Also, the relatively high cell wall content of feces may have provided an effective, temporary sink for fertilizer-N, which upon remineralization provided more N to millet than pots amended with leaves. Whereas most of the P contained in feces mineralized and was taken up by millet, most leaves immobilized P. Assessing the costs and benefits associated with the direct land application of biomass as a soil fertility amendment versus feeding biomass first to livestock then using feces (and urine) to fertilize the soil requires information on both crop and livestock production and associated impacts on nutrient cycling.

With hindsight it often appears that full advantage is not taken of what is known. Part of the reason organizations neglect apparent warnings is because of limited resources and the way resources an allocated. Drawing on concepts from the resource-based view (RBV) of the firm, this paper examines situations where resource availability and use can compromise safety by initiating drift. Empirical evidence from the nuclear power industry is reviewed to demonstrate the relationship between resources, resource deployment, and drift. Drift is influenced by error signals, feedback loops, and imperfect watchfulness. Resource availability and use can initiate drift, but they do not necessarily yield catastrophe. Should organizations fall into a threatened position, they can enlist characteristics, behaviors, and capabilities to stabilize the situation, avoid breaching the safety border. and achieve greater security. Through an in-depth study of two plants with contrasting reputations for safety, this paper identifies the characteristics, behaviors, and capabilities that organizations on the edge exhibit. The characteristics, behaviors, and capabilities of the plant with the stronger safety reputation changed after a significant reduction of resources. Resource reduction led to movement toward the safety border, which in turn led to change. Evidence shows that organizations operating closer to the border of safety respond to warnings from unusual events in a resilient rather than anticipatory way. To overcome unexpected problems and limitations, they rely on after-the-fact intervention rather than preparation, foresight, and the provision of countermeasures. Once they recognize they have problems, they explore for novel approaches, typically seeking new knowledge and skills by dismissing old staff and hiring new people, buying advice from outside experts or consultants, and modeling, benchmarking, and copying other organizations' best practices. Organizations on the edge initiate change in response to external demands for change often only after painful public incidents. These organizations emphasize hierarchy and powerful headquarters staff, and their leaders tend to act as commanders and controllers rather than as catalysts and facilitators. The focus of this paper is not on the occurrence of accidents per se, nor on highly reliable operations, bur on the precursors and consequences of drift within a safety border. Operating on the edge of the border extends beyond safety to other performance measures and beyond nuclear power to other industries. In settings as diverse as U.S banks, hospitals, and universities, Israeli kibbutzim, Japanese kereitsu, and Korean chaebol, operating on the edge has become more common.

AB The threat that the bushmeat trade presents to primates and other taxa was assessed from the literature, including data from markets, village hunting studies and logging concessions in Central and West Africa. In many cases the numbers of both common and protected species of primate being killed throughout the region are thought to be unsustainable. This is also the case for other taxa involved in the bushmeat trade, which crosses geographic, cultural and economic boundaries. A suite of measures must be considered to mitigate the effects of this trade, and these measures will have to recognize the local, regional and national socio-economic importance of the trade if they are to result in long-term conservation success.

AB Current events (Corsica, Yugoslavia, etc.) sometimes give flashes of insight into the relation of our so-called democratic societies with the rule of law and the functioning of the justice system.
   The use or perversion of law and the justice system to serve non-democratic ends constitutes a danger for society and for the very credibility of the democratic system: both the setting-up and the application of the rule of law are essential criteria of a society's sustainable functioning.

AB As the UK's Labour government prepares a new strategy for sustainable waste management, this article considers the efficacy of the previous Conservative government's endeavours. Confusion over the relative merits of reclamation, incineration and landfill has diverted attention from the key priority of minimising waste and increasing recycling. This article considers the muddled aspirations of the Conservative government's policy; its reliance on indirect policy instruments;the capacity of local authorities to respond to these aspirations; and the suggestibility of the greater waste management system. Sustainability may require more sweeping a reconfiguration of the waste management system than has hitherto been considered.

DT Article
AB An American geographer describes and evaluates the first attempt to establish a large, privately operated nature reserve and sustainable agricultural economy in post-Soviet Russia. A 5,200 ha preserve along the Amur River, known as Murav 'yovka Park, was acquired as a 50-year lease from nearby collective farms. The preserve's role as an important breeding area for migratory cranes is examined in the context of international conservation efforts and funding; other functions (e.g., agricultural production, environmental education) also are discussed, based on field observations in 1998. Developments at Murav 'yovka are symptomatic of broader problems involved with privatizing nature conservation in contemporary Russia.

AB This paper examines how political constraints can shape the social security system under different demographics. A steady-state mapping between relevant economic and demographic variables and the social security tax rate resulting from a majority voting is provided. I calibrate an OLG model to the U.S. economy. Calculations using census population and survival probabilities projections and 1961-96 labor productivity growth deliver a social security tax rate of 13.3% (currently 11.2%) and a 54% replacement ratio (51.7%). This result reflects the median voter's aging, from 44 to 46 years, which dominates the decrease in the dependency ratio, from 5.45 to 4.72. (C) 1999 Academic Press

AB This paper 'studies the political sustainability of the existing pay-as-you-go Social Security system in the face of recent demographic patterns. We analyze different approaches to privatizing the system and consider what it would require for them to be politically implementable. The analysis is based on an overlapping-generations economy where an initial generation would choose to implement a pay-as-you-go social insurance system. We study the sustainability of this system in each subsequent period. We describe some transition policies that make the current generations of agents at least as well off as the maintenance of the Social Security system. All feasible transition policies use debt to finance the benefits during the transition period, shifting at least some of the cost to unborn generations. (C) 1999 Academic Press

DE contraception; family planning; Bangladesh; price; access; demand
AB The Family Planning Program in Bangladesh has been very successful. The contraceptive prevalence rate (CPR) has increased from 13% in 1979 to 49% in 1996. Wow that the program has matured and demand for family planning has been created, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW) of the Government of Bangladesh is concerned with increasing its financial sustainability. Options to increase financial sustainability include cost sharing and a gradual transition from doorstep to static clinic delivery of contraceptives; Many of these alternatives would involve additional travel time or charges for consumers, and it is important to estimate the effect that these additional prices would have on the use of contraception.
   The effect of economic constraints, such as cash price and access to services on contraceptive method use, the choice of contraceptive method and provider choice, has been analyzed, taking into account the socioeconomic factors that influence decision-making for individual family members. Two data sources have been used for this analysis: (1) a survey on use of contraception and (2) two baseline surveys of 1993 and 1994 in the two field sites of the MCH-FP Extension Project (Rural) of International Center for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh.
   No effect of cash prices was found on the probability of use of any contraceptive method, but clients were to a limited extent responsive to price in making choices about contraceptive methods and providers. In addition, couples were less likely to use contraception or choose methods if the travel time to fixed clinics was greater than 30 min. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The growth of environmental consciousness has set challenges to the development of remote rural areas dependent on the exploitation of forest and other natural resources. The ecological modernization perspective seems to be leading to a simple disregard for the problems of societal development in these areas. The northern forests are considered to be the 'lungs of Europe' and a storehouse of biodiversity. The perspective of sustainable development attaches greater attention to the incomes of the local residents and functionality of communities. The article stresses that social sustainability must be taken seriously in contemplating the use of natural resources in remote rural areas and in resolving environmental problems. The empirical subject of the article is the North Karelian Biosphere Reserve. There is an appraisal of ways of using natural resources on the reserve, which are both conducive to maintaining employment and ecologically friendly. Utilization of natural resources as well as the strengthening of conservation interests have been significant supra-local actors. Thus, is it important that biosphere reserve operations attract actors from various regional levels.

AB Successful soil quality assessment strategies are needed to improve our ability to manage soils sustainably. Our objective was to use a multivariate data set to determine whether recent adoption of no-tillage (NT) practices had altered soil quality in Illinois. In 1995 and 1996, we sampled thirty-six farm fields under conventional tillage (CT) or NT practices and relatively nondisturbed (ND) areas. Soils were Mollisols or Alfisols. Tillage or region affected 20 of the 23 parameters characterized, Soil chemical parameters were less variable than biological or physical measures. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to assess soil quality overall, Principal component 1 (PCI) stores, which explained 39% of the total variance of the overall data set, were affected by tillage (ND > NT > CT) and increased,vith particulate and organic C and total N, biological activity, mineralizable N, and wet aggregate stability, and decreased with bulk density and dry aggregate mean weight diameter. The only significant factor contributing to PC2 was penetration resistance: PC2 explained 13% of the variance and decreased as follows: NT greater than or equal to ND > CT. Multivariate assessment of soil quality indicated use of NT practices improved the biological and physical condition of the soil (0-15 cm) despite increased consolidation. It also showed that those biological and physical aspects of soils influenced by organic matter were the properties most altered by agronomic practices, Particulate organic matter (POM) was identified as a promising soil quality measure. A nest step is to determine the biological and environmental relevance of a refined set of soil quality measures in conjunction with soil processes of regional concern.

AB Replenishment of soil C and N is essential for sustainable revegetation of minesoils. Our study investigated paper de-inking sludge as the organic amendment for revegetating an abandoned sandpit in Quebec, Canada. Sludge was incorporated at 0 (check) and 105 Mg dry matter ha(-1) before seeding tall wheatgrass (Agropyron elongatum (Host) Beauv.). Nitrogen (at 315, 630 and 945 kg N ha(-1)) and P (at 52.5 and 105 kg P ha(-1)) were also applied to all plots. Distribution of C and N was determined periodically in two sizes (<53 mu m and >53 mu m) and two densities (<1.8 g cm(-3) and >1.8 g cm(-3)) of soil fractions during 823 d. After 823 d, C concentrations were 43 and 69% of those of Day 5, for the low and high N rates, respectively. With time, the proportion of C in the heavy (>1.8 g cm(-3)) fraction increased from 20 to 55%, but remained near 20% in the fine (<53 mu m) fraction. Increasing N rates increased C conservation mainly in the coarse (>53 mu m) fraction. The amount of N recovered in all fractions decreased after Day 86, in accordance with a previous litter bag study. Although inorganic N was positively correlated with total N in all fractions, the fine fraction was the best indicator of the size of the mineral N pool. Addition of sludge to the sandpit favored the restoration of C and N pools, and high levels of mineral N increased this effect. Residues became denser but remained relatively coarse during their decomposition.

AB Conversion of pasture land to crop rotation by plow tillage and reversion to pasture for replenishment of nutrients is a common practice in New Zealand. It is known that plow tillage decreases soil organic matter and causes biological degradation. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of tillage practices on soil microbial biomass carbon (MBC), microbial biomass nitrogen (MBN), microbial biomass phosphorus (MBP), and earthworm (Aporrectodea caliginosa) populations used as indicators of soil biological status and of sustainability of permanent pasture (PP) to crop rotation using different tillage practices. The experimental site at Massey University (Turitea Campus) was established in 1995, where PP land was converted to double crop rotation using plow tillage (PT) and no-tillage (NT), Crops were summer fodder maize (Zea mays L.) and winter oat (Avena sativa L.); and PP was used as a control. Plant establishment and crop yields were similar in NT and PT, although adoption of NT reduced weed growth. Microbial biomass contents in PP and NT treatments were almost twice as much in 0-5 cm depth soil as in 5-10 cm depth soil. No quantitative differences occurred between 0-5 and 5-10 cm depths in the PT treatment. Conversion of PP to PT cropping resulted in a 45% decline in MBC, 53% in MBN and 51% in MBP in the 0-5 cm soil layer. Microbial biomass content ratios in the 5-10 cm layer did not differ significantly among the tillage practices and cropping regimes. At 0-10 cm depth, concentrations of MBC, MBN and MBP were significantly higher in the PP and NT than in the PT treatment. MBC and MBN levels in autumn were significantly higher than in summer and winter. Earthworm populations and live mass were also significantly higher in the PP and NT than in the PT treatment. It was concluded that adoption of NT can protect soils from biological degradation and maintain soil quality as compared with PT management. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Farming systems (FSs), and ways of thinking about them, evolved in space and time. Rapid evolution took place in the last two decades when crop and livestock yields increased, together with concerns about their socio-economic and biophysical tradeoffs. The application of farming systems research (FSR) to agricultural development was a response to problems arising from a predominantly reductionist approach to research and a cornucopian view of external inputs. Modern technologies were either not welcome or caused unexpected negative trade-offs. This paper reviews definitions and forms of FSR and the need for evolution in thinking about agricultural development. Application of thermodynamic theory (TDT)I to the study of farming systems influences discussion between cornucopians and conservationists, and between reductionist and holistic approaches to research. There is a need to recognize context (suitability of technology), and to pay more attention to relations within systems (system dynamics) and to defining criteria for sustainability. The paper links biophysical and socio-economic processes, gives a physical background for the anthropomorphic concepts of waste, and reviews aspects of objectivism and constructivism. It is argued that FSR can only advance if the full portent of these issues is considered in thinking about development of FSs. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI Status of underground space utilisation and its potential in Delhi
SO TUNNELLING AND UNDERGROUND SPACE TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Urban living in metropolitan cities of India is getting difficult clay by day. It is difficult because the growth of population in cities is at a faster pace than the development of the cities. To avoid this situation underground or subsurface facilities have been created in developed countries. Japan has used underground facilities to a great extent in view of less land space available. The paper discusses some aspects of developing underground facilities in Delhi, the capital city of India, and the possibility of a road traffic by-pass tunnel. It is necessary that a master plan is prepared for underground space development in Delhi for its sustainable growth. Creation of an underground space city shall be the dream of all rock engineers and scientists of India for good of the mankind. (C) 1999 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Surveys were conducted across the northern Great Plains of Canada in 1996 and 1997 to determine the nature and occurrence of herbicide-resistant (HR) biotypes of wild oat (Avena fatua). The surveys indicated that resistance to acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACCase) inhibitors (Group I) occurred most frequently relative to other herbicide groups. Group 1-HR wild oat occurred in over one-half of fields surveyed in each of the three prairie provinces. Of particular concern was the relatively high incidence of multiple-group resistance in wild oat in Saskatchewan and Manitoba, In Saskatchewan, 18% of Group 1-HR populations were also resistant to acetolactate synthase inhibitors (imidazolinones), even though these herbicides were not frequently used, In Manitoba, 27% of fields surveyed had wild oat resistant to herbicides from more than one group. Four populations were resistant to all herbicides registered for use in wheat (Triticum aestivum), Depending on the nature of resistance in wild oat, alternative herbicides available for their central may substantially increase costs to the grower. The cost to growers of managing HR wild oat in Saskatchewan and Manitoba using alternative herbicides is estimated at over $4 million annually. For some HR biotypes, alter-native herbicides either are not available or all have the same site of action, which restricts crop or herbicide rotation options and threatens the future sustainability of small-grain annual cropping systems where these infestations occur.

TI Demand, market structure and the formalizing of ministry of health fees:
   A Nicaraguan case study
SO WORLD DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID USER
AB Plagued by recurrent-cost crises, and nonexistent or vague user fee policies, local-level Ministry of Health (MOH) authorities in many countries have been compelled to design and implement their own fee systems. This has commonly resulted in a national user fee "system" that is a patchwork of idiosyncratic, regional or local practices, replete with inconsistencies, and compromised access,equity, efficiency, sustainability and other MOH objectives. This has been the experience of many countries in Latin America, including Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador, El Sa lvador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua. This paper provides an assessment of a user fee system that has developed in a haphazard, locally-led manner. After establishing empirically that there are three distinct health care markets in Nicaragua, an econometric analysis of the choice of provider reveals that consumers have very different price sensitivities in each of the markets. A series of simulations investigating the impact of changing MOH user fee levels suggests that the fees for MOH care in rural areas should be eliminated, while those in the capital, Managua, should be increased. The policy implications of these changes are discussed within a long-term planning context that reflects the stated public health goals of the Government of Nicaragua. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

ID INCOME; INDEX
AB Ahluwalia and Chenery noted that the standard measures of GDP growth imply distributional weights that place greater weight on the income of richer income groups, and proposed distribution-neutral and pro-poor alternatives. More recently, pilot studies by the World Resources Institute (WRI) have questioned the sustainability of GDP growth and have introduced natural resource modifications to national income accounting. To date, no studies have undertaken both revisions concurrently, creating a revised measure based on GDP but corrected for both distributional bias and resource depletion. Such a measure is derived in this paper, and its impact illustrated with data from Indonesia and Costa Rica, the countries studied by the WRI. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In India, lack of effective groundwater institutions at the: local level has resulted in misallocation, deteriorating quality of water and severe overdrafts. To promote sustainable use of groundwater, India could use the Nebraska model which includes formation of natural resource districts, specifying user rights, permits for extraction, quotas and moratorium on new wells in critical areas.

TI Yield sustainability and phosphorus utilization in soybean-wheat system

   phosphorus
SO FIELD CROPS RESEARCH

ID ORGANIC AMENDMENTS; SOIL; EFFICIENCY; SORPTION; LEGUMES; FORMS
AB Low native soil phosphorus (P)availability coupled with poor utilization efficiency of added P is a major constraint limiting the productivity of soybean-wheat system on Vertisols in Indian semi-arid tropics. The use of fertilizer P is limited by its high Cost, while organic inputs generally cannot provide sufficient P for optimum crop growth due to their low P concentration. We, therefore, evaluated in a 5-year field experiment (1992-1997) the effects of integrated use of manure and fertilizer P on crop yield sustainability, P utilization and soil P fertility under soybean-wheat system on a Typic Haplustert. The treatments consisted four rates each of manure (applied only to soybean) and fertilizer P (applied to both soybean and wheat) arranged in a split-plot design with four replications. Both soybean and wheat crops responded significantly to the application of manure and fertilizer P. For the same level of P input, the yield increases were greater with manure P than with fertilizer P. Further, integrated use of fertilizer P and manure was better than their sole application in increasing and sustaining the productivity of soybean-wheat system. The P uptake by the crops increased with increasing rates of manure and fertilizer P and was relatively larger in soybean than in wheat. The per cent phosphorus recovery by the crops from fertilizer P decreased with increasing fertilizer P tart, while it was improved in the presence of manure. Though the extent of fertilizer P recovery was more or less similar in both the crops, soybean was more efficient than wheat in extracting the soil and manure P. The available P status of the soil showed a significant build-up during successive cropping seasons due to fertilizer P and the increase was strikingly greater when fertilizer P was applied in combination with manure. The integrated use of manure and fertilizer P is a promising strategy to improve soil P fertility status and to obtain higher and sustained productivity of the soybean-wheat cropping system on Vertisols of the semi-arid tropics.

AB Eddy covariance measurements of carbon dioxide and water vapor exchange were made above a ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Dougl. ex P. and C. Laws.) forest located in a semiarid environment in central Oregon. The stand is a mixture of old-growth and young trees. Annual net carbon gain by the ecosystem (NEE) was 320 +/- 170 gC m(-2) year(-1) in 1996 and 270 +/- 180 gC m(-2) year(-1) in 1997. Compared to boreal evergreen forest at higher latitudes, the pine forest has a substantial net carbon gain (150 +/- 80 gC m(-2) year(-1) in 1996 and 180 +/- 80 gC m(-2) year(-1) in 1997) outside the traditionally defined growing season (from bud swell in early May (Day 125) to partial leaf-off in late September (Day 275)). Carbon assimilation continued to occur in the relatively mild winters, though at a slower rate (April, maximum leaf level assimilation (A(max)) of 6-9.5 mu mol m(-2) leaf s(-1)), and ecosystem respiration was relatively low (similar to 1.6 +/- 0.1 gC m(-2) day(-1)). In the growing season, although photosynthetic capacity was large (July, A(max) = 16-21 mu mol m(-2) leaf s(-1)), carbon assimilation was constrained by partial stomatal closure to maintain a sustainable water flow through the soil-plant system, and ecosystem respiration was large (3.5 +/- 0.1 and 4.3 +/- 0.1 gC m(-2) day(-1) in growing season of 1996 and 1997, respectively) because of high air and soil temperatures. Despite large changes in evaporative demand over just a few days (VPD changing from 0.5 to 3.5 kPa), the ecosystem water use was remarkably constant in summer (similar to 1.6-1.7 mm day(-1)). Such homeostasis is most likely another result of stomatal control. Interannual variations in climate had a large influence on the ecosystem carbon balance. in summer 1997, an El Nino year, precipitation was more frequent (17 days with 33 mm of rain) than in summer 1996 (5 days with 5 mm of rain), and the net ecosystem exchange was substantially lower in July to September 1997 (10 +/- 60 gC m(-2)) than during the equivalent period in 1996 (100 +/- 60 gC m(-2)). Although temperatures between years were similar, the carbon assimilation in 1997 was offset by increased respiration, probably because soils were more frequently wet, encouraging microbial respiration.

AB While discussing issues concerning public transport, safety and the environment, this paper illustrates that unless the needs of non-motorised modes of traffic are met, It will be almost impossible to design any sustainable transport system far urban areas. If the infrastructure design does not meet the requirements of pedestrians, bicyclists and non-motorised rickshaws, all modes of transport operate in sub-optimal conditions. However, re-designing existing roads will not only provide a safer and-convenient environment for non-motorised modes, it will also improve efficiency of public transport vehicles and enhance the capacity of the corridor when measured in number of passengers transported per hour per lane.

AB Silvicultural guidelines for uneven-aged management have traditionally been based on the regulation of 'balanced' stand structures that allow for periodic yields at regular intervals while providing adequate growing space for multiple cohorts. To evaluate certain assumptions behind the 'balanced' diameter distribution concept we investigated differences in the size structure, canopy recruitment, and growing space allocation among 31 old-growth, managed uneven-aged (selection), and even-aged northern hardwood stands in north-central Wisconsin and adjacent western Upper Michigan. The frequency of stands meeting criteria for balanced uneven-aged structure was substantially affected by whether diameter distributions were plotted for all crown classes combined (traditional approach) or whether the distributions included only trees with crowns exposed overhead to skylight. While all 10 old-growth stands and 11 of the 15 selection stands met the traditional criteria for balanced structure, only 50% and 27%, respectively, met the more stringent criteria for balanced structure that included evidence of substantial gap sapling recruitment. Both negative exponential and rotated sigmoid diameter distributions were found among individual old-growth and selection stands. However, all old-growth stands classified as balanced (based on exposed canopy trees) had rotated sigmoid diameter distributions for all species pooled and for sugar maple only. Negative exponential distributions were also observed in some 'balanced' stands, but only among the selection stands. Aggregate crown area distributions in old-growth and selection stands with reasonably smooth reverse-J diameter distributions provided support for a modified interpretation of the equal area allocation hypothesis. While the aggregate exposed crown area occupied by each size class tended to be lower for small trees than for medium and large trees, total crown area distribution for trees with partially or fully exposed crowns did approximate a nearly uniform distribution.

AB The expression of the PML gene was investigated in purified early hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) induced to unilineage erythroid or granulocytic differentiation. PML mRNA and protein, while barely detectable in quiescent HPCs, are consistently induced by growth factor stimulation through the erythroid or granulocytic lineage. Thereafter, PML is downmodulated in late granulocytic maturation, whereas it is sustainably expressed through the erythroid pathway. In functional studies, PML expression was inhibited by addition of antisense oligomers targeting PML mRNA (alpha-PML). Interestingly, early treatment (day 0 HPCs) with cr-PML reduced the number of both erythroid and granulocytic colonies, whereas late treatment (day 5 culture) reduced erythroid, but not granulocytic, clonogenesis. These findings suggest that PML is required for early hematopoiesis and erythroid, but not granulocytic maturation. The pattern of PML expression in normal hematopoiesis mimics that of retinoblastoma pRb 105. Combined treatment of HPCs with alpha-PML and alpha-Rb oligomers inhibited both PML and Rb protein expression and completely blocked erythroid colony development. Furthermore, PML and pRb 105 were co-immunoprecipitated in cellular lysates derived from erythroid precursors indicating that this functional interaction may have a biochemical basis. These results suggest a key functional role of PML in early hematopoiesis and late erythropoiesis: the latter phenomenon may be related to the molecular and functional interaction of PML with pRb 105.

AB Parrot's feather, Myrophyllum aquaticum (Vell.) Verdc., is one of several exotic plants that invade aquatic ecosystems in South Africa. Unlike the other proclaimed aquatic weeds in South Africa that are free floating, parrot's feather is rooted to the substrate and restricted to water that is less than 1.5 m deep. Dense mats of the weed disrupt ecosystems and hinder utilization of water bodies. In the absence of other practical control mechanisms, biological control was seen as a solution for sustainable management of the weed. An undescribed species of leaf-feeding beetle, Lysathia sp. (Chrysomelidae), was released in South Africa in 1994, marking the first biocontrol agent to be released against M. aquaticum anywhere in the world. The beetle has become established at several release sites throughout South Africa and has reached population levels that severely retard the growth of the weed. However, M, aquaticum is able to recover when beetle numbers decline and additional agents may be required to ensure continuous control of the weed. Nevertheless, prospects for the biological control of M. aquaticum are promising.

AB Although not new, the use of bioindicators is an innovative approach for assessing various types of environmental mismanagement, including pollution, high input fanning, inappropriate disposal of wastes, contamination, etc. This approach uses biological organisms (including invertebrates, the focus of this volume) and biodiversity as tools to assess ongoing situations in the environment. Although lab work is needed, bioindicator-based studies rely extensively on field assessment of a few or limited number of taxa. Sampling, statistics and species identification form a large part of these studies, and must be supported by knowledge of the basic biological and ecological features of the organisms and landscape under study. Computerized open databases offering images and multiple entering accessions are expected to improve the current identification and analysis methods based on manuals, books and two-dimensional figures.
   Bioindicator-based studies have the potential to make a major contribution to optimizing different farming systems, input practices, new crops, rotation, etc., and to influence political policies governing landscape management, urban and industrial areas; landscape reclamation and transformation.
   In particular, laws aimed at reducing environmental contamination and at remediating high input farming must take into consideration environmental benefits that can be assessed using bioindicators; evaluations of new genetically engineered crops must consider biodiversity as a value and bioindicators as tools that can help in reaching decisions about their environmental impact.

AB Increasingly research suggests that the level of internal regulation of function in agroecosystems is largely dependent on the level of plant and animal biodiversity present. In agroecosystems, biodiversity performs a variety of ecological services beyond the production of food, including recycling of nutrients, regulation of microclimate and local hydrological processes, suppression of undesirable organisms and detoxification of noxious chemicals. In this paper the role of biodiversity in securing crop protection and soil fertility is explored in detail. It is argued that because biodiversity mediated renewal processes and ecological services are largely biological, their persistence depends upon the maintenance of biological integrity and diversity in agroecosystems. Various options of agroecosystem management and design that enhance functional biodiversity in crop fields are described. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In agriculture, sustainability can be linked to ecological resilience. In view of present or imminent environmental changes in agricultural landscapes, the diversity of species and genotypes, particularly of potential beneficials and alternative prey, may become of increasing importance. However, the available methods and empirical data concerning species diversity of above-ground insects in agricultural landscapes do not yet allow comprehensive evaluation. Standardized inventory methods must be used more rigorously and over longer time periods to detect significant differences in space and in time. Indicator groups for biodiversity estimates must be defined.
   Methods for optimizing the reliability and comparability of faunistic inventories are proposed, including rarefaction for reference functions and estimation of species numbers per unit area. Recommendations for optimum sampling periods and average empirical numbers for species diversity and abundance of major arthropod groups are given and compared to published data.
   In general, organismal biodiversity is higher in less intensely cultivated habitats. Apart from the impact of biocides, variation in species diversity often depends on the biodiversity of the surroundings (mosaic landscape) rather than on differing management regimes. The focus in preserving or enhancing, but also in evaluating biodiversity in cultivated areas thus should clearly be on the landscape level. Structural biodiversity in agricultural areas appears to be correlated with functional and organismal biodiversity of the above-ground insect fauna. (C)1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Earthworms, which inhabit soils and litter layers in most landscapes, can offer an important tool to evaluate different environmental transformations and impacts. Agricultural landscapes, urban and industrialized habitats have some earthworms that represent interesting indicators to monitor different contaminations, to assess different farming practices and different landscape structures and transformations. Species number, abundance and biomass can give easily measurable elements. Ecological guilds can help in comparing different environments.
   Taxonomy is relatively well known, at least in temperate areas, when species identification is in general easily solved. CD-ROM based programs facilitate rapid identification of collected specimens.
   The substantial amount of research carried out on these invertebrates has made these soil organisms more promising for further improved and accurate work in assessing sustainability of different environments. In most cases earthworm biomass or abundance can offer a valuable tool to assess different environmental impacts such as tillage operations, soil pollution, different agricultural input, trampling, industrial plant pollution, etc. In rural environments different farming systems can be assessed using earthworm biomass and numbers.

AB Those features of the biology of terrestrial isopods which make them appropriate organisms for assessing sustainability are described. They are very widespread, easily identified and form a dominant component of the soil arthropod macrodecomposer community in many temperate habitats, reaching densities of up to 3000 m(-2) in calcareous grasslands. They feed on dead organic material and are key system regulators of the ecosystem functions of decomposition and nutrient recycling. They can be sampled readily by hand, pitfall trapping or extracted from soil by heat and light. They are sensitive to pesticide applications, marked differences in density being found between conventional and organic cultivation regimes. Isopod biomass is higher under no-tillage or minimum tillage regimes which leave crop residues near the soil surface. Isopods tolerate some heavy metals by accumulating them in vesicles in the hepatopancreas. They are thus, potentially useful for monitoring bio-accumulation of such contaminants and can serve as bioindicators of heavy metal pollution. (C)1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

SO AMBIO

DT Article
AB Difficulties in attaining the goal of sustainable development in dry climates are discussed, with the Mediterranean region as a striking example. The exhaustion of soil fertility, and salinization of arable soil contributed substantially to the fall of the earlier cultures. Sustainability comprises the security of food supply by a biomass productivity 2-3 times greater than the present level. Old techniques cannot achieve this goal; only new techniques, involving the recycling of material on a much wider scale than in old, local societies, can do so. New techniques must concentrate primarily on the efficient use of both groundwater and surface water, which also will make possible the efficient use of plant nutrients. Unrealistic ideas of a sustainable biomass production system, based on low-productive local resources, must be replaced by a modern model involving new techniques and knowledge.

AB An attempt was made to study the alternative cropping systems in arid zone of Rajasthan, in comparison to arable farming; The silvopasture based livestock grazing system (silvopastoral systems), hortipasture and arable farming were compared. The silvopastoral and hortipasture systems were more profitable than arable farming system at 12 and 20% discount rates. Sensitivity analysis, further, confirm the results. However, the silvopastoral system with sheep grazing at 20% discount rate is not viable in most cases. Under new economic policy and GATT agreement, the alternative farming system is considered to be more viable, which would not only improve the living standard of the region but also improve the ecological balance and sustainability of the arid zone of Rajasthan.

AB The biosphere reserve is an explicitly spatial approach to ecosystem management. Based on the theory of island biogeography, a biosphere reserve consists of a core area of high ecological value protected by buffers of increasing land-use intensity that provide a gradual transition to surrounding, human-dominated landscapes. This paper addresses implementation of the biosphere reserve associated with the New Jersey Pinelands Comprehensive Management Plan (PCMP). We present results of a statistical analysis assessing claims that the plan has managed to direct growth and land-cover change in a manner consistent with environmental objectives. We show that it has had a strong effect in reducing conversion of natural areas in the Pinelands reserve, and that the effect observed is consistent with biosphere theory. In particular, conversion is lowest in the protection core, and increasing in the protective buffers. Evidently, multiple jurisdictions can unite to reduce the pace of regional ecosystem degradation. We conclude the paper with speculations about the prospects for implementing biosphere planning more broadly, given the apparent success of the PCMP.

TI Biomass-Balance Table for evaluating bioenergy resources
SO APPLIED ENERGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Bioenergy is expected to become one of the key energy resources to cope with global warming and exhaustion of fossil fuel resources. Biomass is renewable and free from net CO2 emissions as long as it is maintained sustainably. There are several studies concerning bioenergy potential, but they are hardly comparable because of the complexity of the assumed parameters, which relate to food, timber and paper supply, forest management, etc. In this study, bioenergy (expressed in Joules) is divided into plantation bioenergy produced on land and bioenergy recovered from biomass residues in the processes of harvest, conversion and consumption for food, timber and paper. We propose a "Biomass Balance Table", which shows systematically the flows of various biomass forms. The scheme of a Biomass-Balance Table is similar to that of an energy-balance table. The steps of the biomass processing (i.e. harvesting, conversion and consumption) are expressed in the column, and biomass forms are expressed in the row. Tables have been constructed for 10 regions in the world in 1990. The world has an existing energy potential from biomass residues of 88 EJ (i.e. 26% of 335 EJ of primary energy supply in 1990) and Japan has 2.02 EJ (10% of 19.52 EJ of primary energy supply in 1990). North America, the former USSR and eastern Europe, and Western Europe have large potentials of wood biomass residues and other Asian countries and the centrally-planned economies of Asia have large potentials food biomass residues.

TI Evaluation of bioenergy resources with a global land use and energy
   model formulated with SD technique
SO APPLIED ENERGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Bioenergy is expected to become one of the key energy resources for global sustainable development. However, bioenergy cannot be infinite, because the land area available for biomass production is limited and a certain amount of biomass must be reserved for food and materials. The purpose of this study is to evaluate global bioenergy potential: for this purpose, the authors developed a global land-use and energy model (GLUE) formulated using a SD (System Dynamics) technique. Through a simulation, the following results were obtained. (1) There will be a certain potential for energy crops harvested from surplus arable land in the developed regions of the world. However, care must be taken because the potential is sensitive to the global food supply and demand. (2) There will be a large bioenergy potential for biomass residues, such as cereal-harvesting residues, animal dung, roundwood felling residues, and timber scrap. The ultimate bioenergy potential, from all the biomass residues, will be 277 EJ/yr in A.D. 2100 in the world. (3) The mature-forest area in the developing regions decreases from 2.1 billion ha in 1990 to 0.8 billion ha in 2100, although it is assumed that the felling area is reforested completely after A.D. 2025. Thus, there will not be much room to obtain more fuelwood from forests in the developing regions. (C) 1999 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Solid animal wastes in Japan are treated mainly by composting. The composting process under controlled conditions is able to convert the wastes into high-quality organic fertilizer. Various types of composting facilities with/without forced aeration and turning device are available. Characterization of the maturing process during composting was studied, to improve the quality of compost and to make the degree of maturity. Recycling of animal wastes as compost without any environmental pollution will be closely related to the development of sustainable agriculture with organic fertilizer in Japan.

AB Congestive heart failure (HF) is a major focus of medical research. Its incidence has greatly increased in recent decades because of art aging population base and the increasingly successful treatment of other forms of chronic cardiac disease. Relevant large animal models of HF should reflect the complex interactions of cardiac dysfunction, neurohumoral dynamics and peripheral vascular abnormalities found in human HF. A number of large animal models have been developed especially in dogs, sheep and swine, using naturally occurring HE; or single or combinations of interventions, as instruments to trigger the development of HF.
   Naturally occurring HF models are not commonly used because of ethical or perceived ethical grounds, however, King Charles Cavalier Spaniel and Yucatan Mini Pig models have been described. Tachycardia induced HF is the most commonly used HF model. Ventricular pacing at 220-240 bpm results in profound low output, biventricular, oedematous failure in two to three weeks. Lower pacing rates result in a more stable, sustainable, lesser degree of failure. Positive features of this model include 'acceptance', aetiological relevance to patient tachycardia induced HF, neurohumoral and functional profile similar to most human HES relatively low cost simple preparation, ability to manipulate the degree of failure with pacing rate, reversibility, reliability and a large amount of published multi species data. Limitations to the use of the model are the rapid onset, the fact that reversibility is only relevant to the tachycardia induced patient HES the absence of hypertrophy in failure, the diminished plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) levels, absence of ANP of ventricular origin, and the interference between rapid pacing and therapeutic interventions. Myocardial damage models of HF include those models induced by ischaemia, eg due to coronary occlusion (ligation or aneroid) or intracoronary microembolism, transmyocardial DC shock, toxic cardiomyopathy from adriamycin, doxorubicin or catecholamines. Overload models of HF may be induced by high pressure from aortic constriction, aortic regurgitation, renal artery constriction, pulmonary stenosis or aortocaval shunts, or by induction of mitral regurgitation from chordae or leaflet damage.
   No single, all-encompassing, large animal model of HF exists to dare. Selection of the type of model to be used should be based primarily on the hypotheses to be tested and secondarily on the available resources and facilities.

DT Article
AB The effects on income and ecology of an Organic Farming System and an Integrated Crop Cultivation System at the experimental station of the Munich Research Association for Agricultural Ecosystems (FAM), are analysed by a computer based calculation system in the fanning years 1992/93-95/96. In this case the necessary energy-input and the greenhouse gases being emitted (CO2, N2O, CH4) by the different systems were calculated parallel to the variable costs of the different farming measures. Fundamentally this examination shows improvements in both systems to realize a more sustainable agriculture in comparison to the previous state. Nevertheless there are some differences between the systems: On one side the yields in the Integrated Crop Cultivation System were much higher than in the Ecological Farming System in this period. On the other side the Ecological Farming System reached a higher income connected with a lower energy-input and a lower emission of greenhouse gases. The Integrated Crop Cultivation System seems to be preferable, if the discussion is focussed primarily on a high agricultural output in order to save a high level on food supply. But on the average the Ecological Farming System is superior in regard with environmental circumstances. Further studies of the FAM including supplementary ecological indicators will supply more information to these preliminary results. Then it should be possible to implement same of the ecologically compatible and sustainable strategies in the landuse management of the region.

Following this logic, the Biotrade Initiative was set up as an international framework to create new 'bio-partnerships' This programme carries opportunities for developing countries to sustainably use and commercialize biodiversity. However, its use as an engine for economic growth in these countries might be limited by institutional and macro-economic constraints.

TI The discourse of 'voice' and the problem of knowledge and identify in
   the Sociology of Education
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY OF EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper presents a critique of 'voice discourse' in the sociology of education (and beyond). The discourse of 'voice' is identified with a position that has recurred periodically since the early 1970s, which reduces knowledge to experience in order to de-legitimise rational, epistemologically grounded knowledge forms and truth claims that are represented as expressing no more than the 'standpoints' and 'interests' of 'dominant' social groups, Today this position is represented in a variety of postmodernist approaches and earlier in phenomenologically inspired approaches associated with the New Sociology of Education. The paper argues that these reductionist, relativistic and perspectival approaches rely upon a simplistic and positivistic caricature of science that appears unaware of significant debates in 'post-empiricist' philosophy of science. Their position is untenable and has been shown to be so for a long time. It is suggested that 'voice' discourse requires to be accounted for sociologically as a position-taking strategy within the intellectual field rather than accepted as a theoretically sustainable approach. Recent work by Basil Bernstein is drawn upon in order to produce a structural description of this position.

AB In March 1989, the Exxon Valdez ran aground in Prince William Sound, Alaska. It was an environmental tragedy that revealed how ill prepared the nation's ports were for a major oil spill. It also had an unforeseen benefit: it helped launch a new cleanup industry, bio-remediation. The experience further underscored how central corporate responsibility has become to the country's reconciliation of its economic and environmental aspirations, especially if progress in cleaning up our air and water, which has been substantial the past quarter century, is to continue. This reconciliation lies at the heart of the concept of sustainable development. Sustainable development is not just about achieving greater efficiency in the use of energy and materials, which is important, but also envisions fundamental product innovation and the use of less materials. One dimension of the challenge of sustainable development is for government to craft incentives to foster innovation without prescribing corporate behavior. Another is to engage the developing world constructively on such critical issues as water and private investment, which can improve the lives of people, especially the poor. Without the cooperation of developing countries, it is unlikely that global environmental problems like climate change can be addressed effectively.

TI Impacts of full cost pricing on the sustainability of urban
   transportation: towards Canada's Kyoto commitments
SO CANADIAN JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING

DT Article
DE sustainable transportation; road pricing; full cost pricing; urban
   transportation; emissions
AB Certain concerns about sustainable transportation derive from the premise that significant atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases which contribute to global warming can be attributed to automotive emissions. Among measures considered to curtail automobile dependency and increase transit modal split, "full cost pricing" - a means of extracting both environmental costs and hidden subsidies which road users allegedly impose on society - has emerged as an increasingly popular suggestion. This paper examines the potential impact of full cost pricing on the "sustainability" of urban transportation, using Toronto as a case study. The analysis deals with the direct effects on mode choice and vehicle utilization resulting from increased user costs as might be achieved through fuel taxes or road pricing, as well as the indirect, longer term effects on location decisions. To investigate the land-use impacts, population distributions were altered to reflect more compact development and less urban sprawl as a proxy for relocations that might result from an increase in the costs of automobile use. Impacts are presented in terms of changes in total peak period vehicle-kilometres, mode split, and CO2 emissions. Despite several qualifications related to modelling techniques used in the case study, the analysis suggests that, overall, the impacts of large increases in road user costs appear to be less than proponents of full cost pricing would expect. In addition, the analysis suggests the fairly obvious, namely, that the greatest impacts of pricing occur within those choice markets where reasonable alternatives to the private automobile actually exist.

TI Copper and nickel smelting with virtually zero gas emission - A vision
   for the future
SO CIM BULLETIN

AB Virtually zero gas emission smelting is promoted as a means for securing environmental advantages and the general public's acceptance. Concerns about climate change will increasingly make it more difficult for new primary metals projects to come to fruition unless greenhouse gas emissions are decreased. Assuming a sustainable market for sulphuric acid is not locally available the next best option is high temperature reaction of strong SO2 with limestone or dolomite. This is followed by CO2 liquefaction and disposal either underground or in the deep ocean. The Voisey's Bay nickel project is cited as an example where appropriate location of a new smelter close to large dolomite or limestone deposits would lead to a virtually zero gas emission operation. Most of the electrical energy required for producing technically pure oxygen and for liquefying CO2 and transporting it to disposal can be derived from smelting a bulk sulphide concentrate and then reacting SO2 at high temperature. Provided the smelter gases are properly cleaned before sulphur fixation, the sulphated stone should be uncontaminated and environmentally benign and possibly of use in the building and construction industry.

AB The objective of any process system engineering activity generally includes the simulation and design of some kind of plant. We conjecture, however, that in order to meet the objectives of sustainable development, material cycles need to be modelled, in order to assess the fate of toxic materials such as heavy metals and harmful organic components.
   Such modelling can be the basis of a decision support-tool. The outline of a materials-cycle modelling strategy is presented by addressing the major problems encountered.

DT Article
AB The decline in the range and numbers of elephants as a result of expanding human activity in Africa is recognized ns one of the continent's more serious conservation problems. Understanding the relationship between human settlement patterns and elephant abundance is fundamental to predicting the viability of elephant populations. The prevailing model of human-elephant interaction predicts a negative linear relationship between rising human density and declining elephant density at a coarse (national or subcontinental) scale. Using observed elephant densities and human population data, we tested this prediction in a study area of 15,000 km(2) in northwestern Zimbabwe. The results did not fit a linens model Elephant and human coexistence occurs at various levels of human density, tip to a threshold of human density beyond which elephant populations disappear. This threshold seems to be related to a particular stage in the process of agriculturally transformed land becoming spatially dominant over the natural woodland that constitutes elephant habitat. Within the contexts of conservation and sustainable development in African savannas, investigating spatial relationships between elephant and human abundance should be a priority topic for future research.

AB Of Azerbaijan's 7,564,800 inhabitants, 52.2% live in urban and 47.8% in rural areas. With the transition to market-oriented economy, health problems have worsened. Expenditures for health care fell from 2.9% of GDP in 1990 to 1.2% in 1997. In case of illness, 37% of population prefer self-treatment, and 68% of treatment refusals are due to the inability of patients to pay for the treatment. Maternal mortality rate increased from 10.5 deaths per 100,000 live births in 1991 to 52 deaths per 100,000 live births in 1996. However, diphteria has been reduced to sporadic cases, whereas polio has not been reported since 1996. A pilot reform of primary health care was initiated in one of the districts, and soon expanded to four more districts. The aims were the improvement of health management, rationalization/optimization through development of traditional services, organization of preventative activities, rational use of drugs, institution of sustainable financial mechanisms through affordable fees for services, drug sales within health facilities with corresponding management and the accounting systems for the revenues, development of the exemption system, and community participation in district health. Increased patient attendance to health facilities, improved access to the vulnerable population health services, empowered health system management, better quality of care, and reduced overall individual expenditures were observed.

AB Business Process Reengineering (BPR) has been a major catalyst of the pervasive organizational change we have witnessed over the past decade. Although one can speculate on the reasons for the popularity of this phenomenon, it is important that we carefully examine its underlying antecedents for initiation, implementation, and ultimately success, if we are to add value to practitioners of this concept. This study empirically examines the importance of facets of the organizational structure, IT knowledge resources and infrastructure, and the IS function in the initiation of BPR. Data from 313 corporations were gathered using a carefully validated survey, and initiators were compared with noninitiators. The results strongly suggest that client-server architectures, the strategic integration of IS, and cross departmental interaction are among the more important factors facilitating initiation and can be important inputs in a BPR decision-making process. The study attempts to build a contingent theory for BPR, and the more sustainable notion of fundamental process change.

AB The early phases of a project to design and make operational an ombudsman for humanitarian assistance (HAO) are described in this paper. Beginning with a brief historical overview of the ombudsman concept, it then outlines seven key features of a potential HAO that were identified in the initial feasibility study. The main conclusion from the feasibility study was that, in principle, it is possible to design an HAO by adapting the operational frameworks of existing ombudsman schemes so as to match the needs of the humanitarian sector. Although this seems possible in theory, there still remain some major challenges requiring practical testing in a pilot phase. The most fundamental of these is how to enable the beneficiaries of aid to make their voices heard and register their views on the management of the emergency that is affecting them. Important also, are the issues of ensuring an international jurisdiction and finding sustainable ways of financing the scheme. Finally, the paper alludes to the framework of the pilot itself and how to address the main challenges ahead.

TI Influence of health education on community participation in rapid
   assessment of onchocerciasis prior to distribution of ivermectin
SO EAST AFRICAN MEDICAL JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB Objective: To investigate the impact of health education on community participation in the rapid assessment of onchocerciasis prior to distribution of ivermectin in Nigeria,
   Design: There was health education with use of pictorial monographs to an adult population and school children in Umulumgbe and Okpatu communities, respectively, The school children in turn transferred the knowledge acquired to their parents through a health club, and a third community (Awhum) had no health education. Randomly selected subjects in each community were then assessed for their ability to recognise clinical manifestations of disease,
   Setting: The study took place in three onchocerciasis-endemic, autonomous communities in Udi local government area of Enugu state in eastern Nigeria.
   Subjects: Fifty, thirty seven, and thirty three male subjects, aged 20 years and above in Umulumgbe, Okpatu and Awhum respectively were involved in the study.
   Results: 89.3%, 100% and 25.6% of the total number of onchocercal nodules were rightly indicated by the subjects in Umulumgbe, Okpatu and Awhum respectively. 100% of skin depigmentation was also reported in Umulumgbe and Okpatu each, and 50% in Awhum, Although some of the clinical manifestations (onchocercal nodules and skin depigmentation) were wrongly indicated, others (hanging groin and enlarged scrotum) were not reported by the subjects at all,
   Conclusion: This study clearly shows that health education is necessary for control programmes that are meant to be sustainable, especially the WHO-supported community-directed treatment with ivermectin (CDTI).

ID TABLES
AB A method to analyse the ecological sustainability of a regional economy is presented. It uses input-output models for evaluation of the region together with descriptive indices of the environmental pressures caused by the region. Environmental pressures considered are those that can be described as material flows from the anthroposphere to the ecosphere. The dissipation area index is introduced as a tool for an aggregated evaluation of these flows. The index evaluates the flows of different substances based on reference systems of the natural environment. In order to allow a clear and consistent evaluation with these instruments, a typology of a region's responsibility for environmental pressures is proposed. It distinguishes responsibility for direct and indirect environmental pressures and for environmental pressures inside and outside the boundaries of the region. The implications of various principles of regional responsibility are discussed. A case study of a small Austrian region illustrates the application of the methodology. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

   Italy; resource throughput
AB There is a growing consensus among natural and social scientists that sustainability depends on maintaining natural capital. However, progress to put this ecological condition to practice has been slow, not least because of the inability of making these objectives measurable. Therefore, to overcome this obstacle, assessment frameworks for natural capital are needed. This study presents a simple framework for national and global natural capital accounting. It demonstrates, using the example of Italy, an accounting framework which tracks national economies' energy and resource throughput and translates them into biologically productive areas necessary to produce these flows. This calculation has been applied to over 52 countries. With this framework, based on the ecological footprint concept, human consumption can be compared with natural capital production at the global and national level, using existing data.

   Australian economy
SO ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS

DT Article
DE ecological restructuring; dematerialization; delinking; ecologically
   sustainable development
ID KUZNETS CURVE; INTENSITY; EAST
AB The possibility of reconciliation between economic growth and environmental quality has been foreshadowed by several influential reports over the last decade. The potential basis for reconciliation lies in delinking economic growth from material and energy throughput, especially through ecological restructuring toward modes of production, consumption and trade which are less environmentally intensive. So far, empirical studies of delinking and ecological restructuring have shown conditional improvements in a small number of industrialized countries-mostly high-income European economies. However, there are reasons to believe that the situation may vary in natural resource-based economies (such as Australia) due to differences in trade and economic structures and incentives. Achieving (global) sustainable development will hinge upon prospects for ecological restructuring in all nations. Some of the central concepts of ecological restructuring are reviewed and extended to an empirical search for signs of delinking in Australia. To do this, time series trends in physical quantities of seven environmentally significant factors are examined (i.e, energy, freight, cement, paper, steel, aluminium and plastic). The factors serve as proxies for economic activity of a particularly environmentally intensive nature. Three dimensions are analyzed: material-intensity, absolute throughput, and per capita throughput. The results show that promising trends in the 1980s have not persisted in the face of relatively high population growth and economic growth. Some implications for ecological restructuring as a basis for sustainable development in natural resource-based economies are discussed in light of evidence from Australia.

TI Carrying capacity in agriculture: global and regional issues
SO ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
LA English
DT Article
DE carrying capacity; agricultural yields; ecological limits; population
ID FOOD SECURITY; ENVIRONMENT; TRENDS
AB Much of the debate over world agricultural futures centers on the issue of yield growth. 'Optimists' in the field base their analyses on a technology- and input-driven rate of increase in yields which, they argue, has outpaced population growth and will continue to do so, leaving a margin for steady increase in per capita incomes. Those who are sometimes classified as 'pessimists' (we prefer the term 'ecological realists') see practical limits to global and regional carrying capacity in agriculture, and maintain that the world is close to, or may even have passed, these limits. Projections for world agriculture in the first half of the twenty-first century vary widely, largely depending on assumptions on yield growth. We investigate the pattern of yield growth for major cereal crops, and present evidence that the growth pattern is logistic, not exponential. This pattern is consistent with ecological limits on soil fertility, water availability, and nutrient uptake. Projections for supply and demand in the twenty-first century based on a logistic rather than an exponential model of yield growth imply that the world is indeed close to carrying capacity in agriculture, and that specific resource and ecological constraints are of particular importance at the regional level. A supply-side strategy of increased production has already led to serious problems of soil degradation and water overdraft, as well as other ecosystem stresses. This implies that demand-side issues of population policy and efficiency in consumption are crucial to the development of a sustainable agricultural system. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB The agricultural mesocosm of Biosphere 2, known as the Intensive Agricultural Biome (IAB), provided food for the inhabitants of the facility during two periods of material closure between 1991 and 1994 (Mission I, September 26, 1991 to September 26, 1993, eight-person crew; Mission II, March 6, 1994 to September 17, 1994, seven-person crew). The design and operation of the mesocosm and preliminary results for food production of the IAB are described for both periods. The overall rate of crop production for the 0.22 ha area (soil depth of 1 m; soil and atmospheric volumes of approximately 2000 m(3) and 38000 m(3), respectively) sustained both crews. Overall production rates in Biosphere 2 exceeded those characteristic of fertile agricultural land in the most efficient agrarian communities, despite comparatively lower light levels, lack of insect pollinators and unusually dense insect pests. Crop yields were markedly higher for Mission II than for Mission I due, in part, to experience and improvements based on the first closure. The health of the Biospherians is briefly discussed in the context of a low-calorie (1800-2200 kcal day(-1) per person for Mission I and 2200-2400 kcal day(-1) for Mission II), nutrient-dense diet characteristic of the Biosphere 2 food paradigm. sigh productivity and biodiversity were due to many factors including high resolution climate control, hyper-intensive agricultural practices, selection and planting of food crops adapted to humid, tropical and sub-tropical conditions, nutrient recycling, intensive pest management, and the superambient levels of atmospheric CO2 (concentrations up to 4500 ppmv were reported during the 1991 to 1994 occupations). Radiation use efficiency (RUE) for wheat for both periods and a post-Mission II planting were comparable to RUEs observed in other experimental elevated CO2 settings such as Controlled Ecological Life Support-Systems (CELSS) and Free Air CO2 Enrichment studies (FACE) even though yields were comparatively lower due to low light levels. Integrated management of pests, soil conditions and agricultural practices were key factors in the sustainability of the IAB resulting in minimization of plant loss due to insect herbivory, nematode infestation and reduction in the quality of IAB soils. The use of soils rather than hydroponic systems for the IAB had significant consequences for CO2, N2O and O-2 concentrations in the Biosphere 2 atmosphere and rendered primary regeneration technologies ineffective over the periods of closure. The initial high organic carbon content of the IAB soils prescribed by the designers proved to be the largest single source of CO2 and the largest sink for O-2. The choice of a soil-based compared to a hydroponic-based agricultural system contributed to the accumulation of N2O to levels as high as 300 times current ambient levels (approximately 310 ppbv). The IAB of Biosphere 2 has the potential; with system improvement, to be a high-yielding, self-sustaining agricultural mesocosm suited for a variety of research endeavors.

AB A comprehensive forest growth model (CenW) is described here. The model links the flows of carbon, energy, nutrients and water in trees and soil organic matter. Modelled tree growth depends on physiological plant factors, the size of plant pools, such as foliage mass, environmental factors, such as temperature and rainfall, and the total amount and turn-over rates of soil organic matter, which drives mineralisation of soil organic nitrogen. The model was validated against experimental data obtained for Pinus radiata from the Biology of Forest Growth (BFG) site near Canberra, Australia. The BFG experiment was conducted over 5 years, and included controls and treatments with irrigation and/ or fertiliser addition. Growth rates across treatments ranged about 2.5-fold. The model realistically simulated water use, foliage production and turn-over, foliar nitrogen dynamics, wood production and stand architecture across a wide range of responses under variable water and nitrogen supply due to experimental treatments and natural variations in rainfall. The model can be used to simulate the effects of silvicultural treatments, such as stand thinning, or to assess the sustainability of long-term site productivity based on simulation of the nutrient budget of forest stands. A sensitivity analysis was carried out to identify the parameters and external drivers to which overall growth was most sensitive. Sensitivity differed depending on growth conditions, but growth was always highly sensitive to biomass allocation factors and photosynthetic parameters. Growth was also highly sensitive to parameters describing crown nutritional relationship when nutrients were limiting and to ambient CO, concentration and stomatal parameters when water was limiting.

AB Many authors state that sustainability is purely a matter of the management of scarce and ever-diminishing "negentropy," while others still pretend that unlimited exploitation of the environment is possible. Either view rests on fundamental misunderstandings of ecosystems. Ecologically, sustainability must mean a mutualistic sym biosis. II is useful to understand symbiosis from a thermodynamic point of view. Many organisms-including humans in principle-are able to modulate large flows of free energy, directing it into the formation of organized structures, while expending a proportionately small amount of free energy in the process. They are thus able to capture useful energy for their ecosystem as a whole. Ecosystems can thus maintain a high degree of internal coherence and, just as can individual organisms, apparently defy the Second Law of Thermodynamics within their own boundaries. The breakdown of ecosystem coherence we observe in the world today is thus a symptom not so much of the "Law of Entropy" but: of the undermining of the ecosystem's autopoietic capacity by human parasitism. A guarded optimism about the possibility of sustainability is thus possible, so long as we grasp the particular way in which humans can contribute to ecosystem vitality. Even very subtle features of human culture may contribute positively to the physical vitality of the ecosystem.

TI Environmental taxes on fuels and electricity - some experiences from the

SO ENERGY POLICY
LA English
DT Article
DE energy taxation; CO2 tax; environmental policy; Nordic countries
AB In economic theory, environment-based energy taxation provides a direct financial incentive for environmentally sound economic behaviour in the energy field. In practice, only a few countries have implemented such taxes unilaterally in the 1990s. To be effective, environment-based energy taxes seem to need international implementation. The EU Commission has made three proposals in 1992, 1995 and 1997, but so far none of them has proceeded in the negotiations. In this article, we focus on implemented environmental taxes on fuels and electricity in the Nordic countries. Firstly, the idea of environment-based taxes as a part of sustainable energy policy is presented. Secondly, we review the impacts of this kind of taxes on the environment, energy production and consumption, income distribution, and competitiveness via estimates presented in the literal sources. Thirdly, we review comparative studies of environmental taxes on energy from a methodological perspective. And finally, we analyse the use of energy tax comparisons in political decision-making. A recent energy tax reform in Finland is used as an example. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

SO ENERGY POLICY

DT Article
AB We report an assessment of maximum feasible cost-neutral reduction in the environmental impacts of energy demand growth in the city of Manaus, Brazil. Manaus is a rapidly growing city located in the heart of the Amazonian rainforest (1500 km of rainforest in all directions). Owing to its geographical isolation, it is attractive to explore the extent to which modern renewable and energy efficiency technologies can move it towards energy sustainability - or at least significantly reduce or delay the next expansion of its conventional energy supply project - without increasing the net present value (NPV) of the energy scenario from the societal perspective. Our results, based on collection and analysis of new and existing data, show that on a technical fix basis (ie, without political support for broader policy changes for reducing conventional energy use), about a quarter of conventional energy consumption for the year 2002 can be cost-neutrally replaced with efficiency and renewables.

AB Many tropical reef fishes spawn in large aggregations, which are readily targeted by fishers. By the 1980s, at least two grouper spawning aggregations were eliminated by intensive fishing off the island of St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands, and another aggregating species, rad hind, was intensively targeted. By 1988, the average length of red hind had greatly decreased to 295 mm, and the sex ratio was extremely skewed to 15 females per male, suggesting a heavily fished stock. Since this species :is a protogynous hermaphrodite, the loss of large individuals (primarily males) could potentially result in sperm limitation in spawning aggregations. In 1990, a spawning aggregation closure was implemented. By 1997, average size of red hind had increased to 395 mm and sex ratio had shifted to 4 females per male. Fish were observed aggregating only in structurally complex habitat along the insular shelf edge. This habitat type is apparently not common along most of the shelf edge off St. Thomas and may provide shelter while reducing risk of predation during aggregation periods. These data suggest that protection of spawning aggregations is a sound management strategy with considerable potential for aiding the sustainable use of reef fish resources.

AB By the late 1980's, humans were removing 76 million metric tons (MMT) of marine fishes annually. The potential sustainable catch is somewhere between 69 and 96 MMT. As a result, major fisheries have collapsed or are in danger of collapsing. Many of these species school. Schooling is effective against gape-limited predators because of dilution and confusion. However, larger predators may exploit schooling behavior to sequester and consume a non-trivial fraction of the group. This is the strategy of fishers. Both gear and fisher behavior have 'evolved' to take advantage of the seemingly canalized response of schooling species. This paper examines the ways artisanal and western fishers have exploited knowledge of the behavior and ecology of schooling species to aid in fish capture. Topics include object association; use of light, sound, and chemicals; perceived barriers; predator-prey and other trophic interactions; inherent cyclical rhythms such as diel migration, lunar spawning, and seasonality; and correlations with the physical environment. Exploiting schooling allows fishers to increase efficiency through knowledge of when and where fish aggregate, or by extending the conditions under which aggregation occurs. However, knowledge of behavioral ecology can also be used to conserve schooling stocks. Gear selectivity, group size and population dynamics, and fisher efficiency are all potential areas of integration between behavioral ecology and fishery management. However, no amount of integration of behavioral ecology into fishery management will have the intended conservation effects if fishing effort is not limited to at least numerical if not behaviorally-sustainable levels.

AB Behavioral theories, insights, and techniques are too frequently ignored by conservation biologists. Yet an animal's survival and reproductive success clearly depend on its behavior. Using examples from marine, freshwater, and terrestrial realms, I assert that behavioral information is invaluable in five conservation areas: (1) managing wild species (e.g., designing marine reserves; reducing animal-human conflicts; understanding and managing species' responses to human-induced environmental stress such as fishing, introduced species, and chemical, visual, and acoustic pollution); (2) actively reversing the decline of imperiled wild species (e.g., reducing by catch by improving selectivity of fishing gear; re-establishing breeding populations and boosting reproduction); (3) assessing biodiversity (e.g., modeling population viability; censusing and monitoring populations and species); (4) captive breeding and reintroduction programs (e.g., minimizing loss of valuable phenotypes; teaching or maintaining valuable survival skills); and (5) changing human behavior in resource exploitation (e.g., using principles from social psychology). Both realized and potential applications to fishes are stressed. Finally, behavioral diversity, a valuable but neglected element of biodiversity, needs to be explicitly conserved to maintain diverse populations. Arguments are presented that the conservation of species diversity and genetic diversity alone does not necessarily protect important behavioral diversity. The maintenance of both individual and population variability may be essential for the preservation of a species.

AB The UNCED Environmental Conference in Rio de Janeiro 1992 has changed the world. Geoscientists entered the environmental field relatively late, however, geological surveys and geoscientific research institutes adapted to this situation and have placed geo-environmental, issues high on their agendas. This paper discusses their role against the background of the most relevant issues in 'sustainable development' for the next decade. These include water; soil, poverty alleviation, urbanisation, waste disposal, energy, minerals, disaster reduction and education. Although geoscientists cannot prevent nor cure all of the world's major problems, their ability to cope with long time and wide space scales together with their advanced technologies can and must contribute to solving many of society's problems. This, however, requires a new and untraditional type of geoscientist.

TI Commercial overfishing and property rights
SO FISHERIES

AB Management of many commercial fisheries includes a struggle to avoid overfishing. Natural resource agencies fail in this struggle when the application of biological, sociological, or philosophical sciences fails. In addition, the), fail because they underestimate the pervasiveness of greed and the power of commerce, not because they lack good intentions. Current strategies to manage commercial fishing include extending property rights for fish harvests. The objective of this paper is to stimulate debate on the need-and consequences-of extending property rights to wild, exploitable fish populations as opposed to granting harvest rights. The question is, If property rights for fish were awarded to nonfishing, nongovernmental entities that then sell fishing rights to han esters and help manage fish stocks, would this system be more likely to produce sustainable harvests and benefits? Strategies to achieve sustainable wild fish benefits are many and diverse. Should we explore extending property rights for fish to nonharvesting entities as another possible strategy for managing some commercial fisheries?

TI Post-European changes to the fluvial geomorphology of Bega catchment,
   Australia: implications for river ecology

AB 1. Within a few decades of European disturbance in the mid-nineteenth century, river character and behaviour were transformed in Bega catchment on the south coast of New South Wales, Australia. Ecological impacts of geomorphic changes to river structure and function throughout the catchment are assessed.
   2. At the time of European settlement, many water courses in Bega catchment were discontinuous, with extensive swamps along middle and upper courses. Following a series of direct and indirect human impacts, channels became continuous in the middle and upper parts of the catchment, as extensive valley fills at the base of the escarpment were incised. Along the lowland plain, the channel widened by over 300%, fundamentally altering the relationship between the channel and its adjacent floodplain.
   3. Geomorphic changes to river structure have modified habitat availability throughout Bega catchment. The impacts have been least pronounced in headwater streams, but have been dramatic along virtually all river courses beyond the base of the escarpment.
   4. Changes in river structure have been directly related to altered riparian vegetation cover, and vice versa. As a consequence of changes to river structure, bed substrate calibre (and supply volume/rate) has been modified along most streams.
   5. A series of indirect, secondary impacts have modified habitat viability along river courses. Lateral, longitudinal and vertical linkages within the river system have been altered, affecting the transfer of water, sediment, organic matter, nutrients and other biotic interactions.
   6. These direct and indirect consequences of geomorphic changes in river structure suggest that ecologists need to adopt a longer-term, catchment-framed view of human disturbance to river ecosystems.
   7. Effective, sustainable ecological rehabilitation of river courses is dependent on an understanding of geomorphic processes and determination of appropriate river structure at differing positions in catchments.

ID URBAN AGRICULTURE; PERIURBAN ZONE
AB Three major themes in the current discussion of African cities are poverty, the effects of economic structural adjustment programmes and the need for greater sustainability of urban systems. In relation to each of these the potential benefits of increased food production in urban and peri-urban areas have been highlighted. This paper uses the case of milk production and marketing in and around Dar es Salaam, Tanzania to explore the impacts of changing economic and policy contexts on one element of the urban food system. It is concluded that neither the limited number of commercial milk produces in the peri-urban zone nor the recently expanded number of small-scale urban producers are likely to form the basis of a sustainable, locally based milk system for the city. The enthusiasm for sustainable cities, and food production in urban and peri-urban zones to support them, should not be allowed to divert policy and limited investment funds toward agricultural activities and systems which have little long-term comparative advantage.

SO HABITAT INTERNATIONAL

DE globalization; coastal city; city planning; China
AB Globalization of the world economy has assigned an important role to coastal cities to play in national development. In China, since the reform and openness policy was introduced in 1978, coastal cities have been called to act as "engines" in economic growth. By using the Chinese experiences, this paper examines the development of coastal cities in national economic change, and discusses the issues and challenges in coastal city planning. The Chinese experiences show that the development of coastal cities is dependent upon national policies of making use of the sea in connecting China to the global economy. Once national development strategy is determined, the economic and spatial structure of coastal cities can be planned accordingly. The use of market mechanisms to China's land and housing markets provides an effective means for management of the coastal cities. Appropriate balances between government control and market determination in migration, between equity and efficiency in regional development, between economic growth and sustainability in resource use, are the main challenges ahead of Chinese planners in coastal city development.

AB Establishing secure tenure is widely recognized as a fundamental component of sustainable forest management Policy-makers generally prefer privatization to achieve these ends, although common property institutions may also be appropriate. But if common property tenure is insecure and fails to control exploitation, theory predicts that private tenure should lead to better forest conditions. In this case study of a western Honduras community, forest mensuration data were collected from four private forests and two relatively open access common property forests. Statistical analyses failed to find consistent, significant differences in vegetation structure or soils related to tenure. Notable contrasts between forests reflected historical conditions and owner preferences. Neither form of tenure appeared to emphasize concerns for sustainable management, and ongoing processes of change constrained the possibility for limiting common property forest exploitation The study adds to others which show that the outcomes of private or common property tenure relate substantially to the socioeconomic, political, and ecological context.

AB This paper presents evidence of emerging waterfowl conservation practices and attitudes among certain groups of contemporary Yup'ik subsistence hunters in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta, a remote, wetlands dominated region of western Alaska crucial to several species of Pacific migratory birds. By examining what factors motivate hunters to follow restraint practices and evaluating how federal goose management policies impact these factors, I argue that recent policy has succeeded not by enforcement of regulations but by providing minimum necessary conditions for voluntary conservation to emerge as a cultural practice. This example of cooperative management may serve as a model for future, sustainable wildlife policies that involve indigenous resource users.

AB The Multimedia Cable Networks Systems (MCNS) Data Over Cable Service Interface Specifications (DOCSIS) is established as the primary cable network data communications standard. The head-end scheduling algorithm is not defined within the standard but it is the key function for providing the required performance capability. Computer simulation, using the Common Simulation Framework (CSF) 12 version of the CableLabs DOCSIS 1.0 computer model, has been used to predict the upstream system throughput and mean access delay. A prioritised first-come-first-served scheduling algorithm has been considered to provide a baseline reference set of performance statistics against which other algorithms can be compared. The simulations, with theoretical confirmation, have shown that the maximum sustainable system throughput is 1965kbps for a channel capacity of 2560kbps and a packet size of 1500 octets, whereas for packet size of 100 octets the maximum sustainable throughput is only 1550kbps. The mean access delay is found to vary between 10-900ms depending on the offered load and assuming that the offered load does not exceed the capacity of the channel. Excess offered load causes service starvation according to the assigned priority.

The sunflower yield equivalents were higher in sunflower - groundnut (Arachis hypogaea)- greengram (Phaseolus radiatus L.) cropping system, than sunflower - maize (Zea mays L.) - greengram; sunflower - sunflower - greengram; sunflower - greengram - greensam; sunflower - blackgram (P. mungo L.) - greengram; sunflower - sesame (Sesamum indicum L.) - greengram cropping system. The sunflower - groundnut - greengram cropping system was found to be stable (sustainable yield index 70%) with higher production efficiency and net returns compared to other cropping systems. In summer, the sunflower yield equivalents and sustainable yield index were higher in groundnut than that of other crops grown.

AB Investigations were carried out to find out a sustainable mixed farming model which is economically viable integrating the crop livestock poultry, duck and fish farming on 1.5 ha land holding. Different viable combinations, viz. (i) arable, (ii) mixed farming with 2 crossbred cows (Jersey x Red Sindhi), (iii) mixed farming with 2 buffaloes (Murrah), (iv) mixed farming with 2 crossbred cows + fish, (common carp + grass carp + rohu + catla mixed), (v) mixed farming with 2 buffaloes, (vi) mixed farming with 2 crossbred cows + 15 goats (Jammunapari) + 10 poultry + 10 ducks + fish were developed to find out the best package on this land holding of 1.5 ha suitable for the tribal region. A model having 2 crossbred cows + 15 goats + 10 poultry birds + 10 ducks on 0.25 ha area including for own living + fish (0.15 ha pond) along with crop cultivation(on 1.1 ha) was the best with a net income of Rs 44 911/year against arable farming alone (Rs 24 093) with a cost returns of 1 : 2 and employment generation of 380-man-day.

AB One of the greatest challenges facing the global society of today and tomorrow involves the production of adequate, clean, sustainable energy for all people. It is clear that new technologies are required, nevertheless adequate energy can be provided by intelligent use of solar, geothermal and solid carbon fuels. The needed new technologies require integration of knowledge and expertise from science, engineering, and economics. New technologies are also needed for the management and use of wastes involved in energy production, including greenhouse gases. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Patient contact is the major determinant in incident leprosy:
   Implications for future control
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LEPROSY AND OTHER MYCOBACTERIAL DISEASES
LA English
DT Article
AB Not withstanding the elimination efforts, leprosy control programs face the problem of many leprosy patients remaining undetected. Leprosy control focuses on early diagnosis through screening of household contacts, although this high-risk group generates only a small proportion of all incident cases. For the remaining incident cases, leprosy control programs have to rely on self-reporting of patients. We explored the extent to which other contact groups contribute to incident leprosy.
   We examined retrospectively incident leprosy over 25 years in a high-endemic village of 2283 inhabitants in Sulawesi, Indonesia, by systematically reviewing data obtained from the local program and actively gathering data through interviews and a house-to-house survey. We investigated the contact status in the past of every incident case. In addition to household contact, we distinguished neighbor and social contacts.
   Of the 101 incident cases over a 25-year period, 79 (78%) could be associated to contact with another leprosy patient. Twenty-eight (28%) of these 101 cases were identified as household contacts, 36 (36%) as neighbors, and the remaining 15 (15%) as social contacts. Three patients had not had a traceable previous contact with another leprosy patient, and no information could be gathered from 19 patients. The median span of time from the registration of the primary case to that of the secondary case was 3 years; 95% of the secondary cases were detected within 6 years after the primary case.
   The estimated risk for leprosy was about nine times higher in households of patients and four times higher in direct neighboring houses of patients compared to households that had had no such contact with patients. The highest risk of leprosy was associated with households of multibacillary patients. The risk of leprosy for households of paucibacillary patients was similar to the risk of leprosy for direct neighboring houses of multibacillary patients, indicating that both the type of leprosy of the primary case and the distance to the primary case are important contributing factors for the risk of leprosy.
   Contact with a leprosy patient is the major determinant in incident leprosy; the type of contact is not limited to household relationships but also includes neighbor and social relationships. This finding can be translated into a valuable and sustainable tool for leprosy control programs and elimination campaigns by focusing case detection and health promotion activities not only on household contacts but also on at least the neighbors of leprosy cases.

AB This paper analyses the fundamental problems of defining and achieving sustainable development. A common core of the various definitions of sustainability circulating is identified. Economic and scientific approaches to operationalize sustainability generally lead to management rules, which - if obeyed - should guarantee sustainability. Since it is not possible to precisely predict the future, this scientific-technical-economic route to sustainability may fail. A second, ethical way, to sustainability which interprets sustainability as an ideal for fair play is introduced. How the two different ways may complement one another with a three-step hierarchy of political goals is elucidated.

AB Improvements in public health services, sanitation, and disease control have contributed to ageing populations in industrialised countries, particularly over the past half century. While these trends should be regarded as positive indications of individual sustainable development, or successful ageing, they also represent potential threats to success of global sustainable development. This paper presents a biodemographical analysis of the recent ageing trends, by discussing individual and global sustainable development in the context of the various biological processes responsible for increases in longevity. It then poses the possibility that an ageing population, by increasing the number of people dependent on environmental, medical, economic, and social resources, will make global sustainability more difficult to achieve, creating obstacles in the ability of future generations to meet their own resource needs. Ultimately, we suggest increasing independence and societal interdependence as solutions to intergenerational tensions and to the potential conflict between individual and global sustainable development.

DE sustainable development; urban environmental problems; policies;

AB Edinburgh, the capital city of Scotland, is unique in that it has established the Lord Provost's Commission on Sustainable Development to advise on the ways in which the city can contribute to sustainable development. This paper briefly considers the sustenance space and the problems of unsustainability for cities. Section two then describes the growth of Edinburgh and emphasises weak and strong measures of sustainability for cities. The third section then considers some of the problems of unsustainability faced by the citizens of Edinburgh. Some of these problems are bequeathed by earlier periods of urban development and others are contemporary in nature. These problems include social exclusion and poverty; economic development problems associated with housing, employment and related transport congestion and land uses; and ecological problems concerned with maintaining natural capital and human capital in a changing urban milieu. Whilst many of the social, economic and ecological problems are specific to Edinburgh, they are also common to other cities in Western Europe. Section four describes some of the new ways in which these problems are being addressed under the tutelage of the Lord Provost's Commission on Sustainable Development in an attempt to make Edinburgh an exemplar of sustainable urban development. Finally, on the basis of this description, some of the lessons learned from this attempt to make a capital city sustainable will be critically discussed with recommendations for further development of programmes to manage Edinburgh as a sustainable city.

AB The paper surveys the literature on the growth performance of the East Asian economies, evaluates the sustainability of that performance, and provides a preliminary assessment of their long-term growth prospects in the aftermath of the current crisis. It highlights special features of East Asian growth, including unusually highfactor accumulation and a favorable demographic transition, but argues that total factor productivity growth has generally been somewhat disappointing. It argues that there are downside risks to the East Asian "developmental state" model, and that it may become less attractive as these economies mature. [JEL N15, N25, N35, O11, O47].

AB The globalization process, formerly dominated by international trade and investment, is largely borne today by the reduction in the costs of information and communication processing, which altogether with the accumulation of knowledge and experience, deeply transforms the context for international transactions. This fast-paced process raises some fundamental policy challenges. At the national level, it has made policy makers much more aware of the increased international implications of their policy actions. Policies that might appear 'sustainable' within a national context may appear less. so in an international one. On the other hand nation states remain the only actors that can help forge the new policy compromises that are needed. This holds not only for traditional macro-economic policy,, but also for social, fiscal, social security and other policies traditionally pursued at the national level. More than ever, the traditional national toolbox of policy instruments appears to be in need of some international counterpart.

AB Mangrove red snapper, Lutjanus argentimaculatus, fry (n=30) were collected in 1993 and reared in concrete tanks. They were fed trash fish every other day initially at 10% to 5%, until they reached three years. They reached 4.18+/-0.14 kg (mean body weight) after five years in captivity. Males matured in four years (mean body weight 2.55 kg, mean total length 49.6 cm) and females in five years (3.92 kg, 57.0 cm). As with other lutjanids, L. argentimaculatus exhibited separate sexes and no sexual dimorphism. Mangrove red snapper broodstock were sexually mature from April to October coinciding with the appearance of fry in the wild and the breeding season of wild-caught adults. Reproductive performance (egg production and quality) of first-time spawning mangrove red snapper broodstock was poorer than that of wild-caught adults. However, the results demonstrate the feasibility of developing mangrove red snapper broodstock in concrete tanks to ensure the sustainability of snapper aquaculture.

AB The re-introduction of forages into the farming systems od central and southern Italy has been advocated by EU policies in order to reduce high inputs and favour more sustainable agricultural systems. Since legumes could certainly play a major role, landraces and natural populations of Trifolium alexandrinum (2), T. incarnatum (5) and T. squarrosum (3) were investigated. Two experiments were conducted during the 1991/92, 1992/93 and 1993/94 seasons in Perugia, central Italy. The objective of the first was to obtain the morphological and physiological characteristics of the entries, while the second assessed the biomass production, forage quality (stem:leaf: inflorescence ratio, protein, fibre, O.M. digestibility, milk and meat Forage Units) and seed yields. In T. incarnatum, flowering time, leaf area, stem length and diameter were important characteristics for discriminating between populations. Norcia and Rocca di Corno, two natural populations of T. incarnatum, flowered early, produced the most biomass and had high forage duality. Their potential as forage/pasture crops and/or cover crops in Mediterranean farming systems is discussed.

AB The use of Mucuna spp. in cover crop and green manure technologies is proving to be successful in the tropics and subtropics following intensive efforts in technology transfer to farmers by NGOs (Non-Governmental Organizations). This includes the transfer of seeds of Mucuna spp, for which the range of adaptation and the effect of environment on crop phenology are poorly understood. A selection of Mucuna spp. germplasm was evaluated over a range of contrasting photothermal conditions in controlled-environment glasshouses. Dates of emergence and first flowering were recorded. Where possible, triple-plane rate of development models were fitted to the first flowering data to quantify the relative sensitivity of each species to photoperiod and temperature. All accessions showed short-day responses but there were substantial differences in the sensitivity of rate of progress to first flowering to environment, particularly to photoperiod. This results in differences in maturity period between accessions which, with appropriate understanding, could be functionally exploited by NGOs and NARS. However, if ignored, it could result in the promotion and use of accessions ill adapted to the environment in which they are tested. In consequence there might be unnecessary resistance from farmers to the adoption of green manure and cover crops technologies which are vital to the design and maintenance of sustainable farming systems in low-income countries in the tropics.

AB The introduction of annual feed legumes into the intensifying systems of barley monocropping in dry-area Mediterranean agriculture would reduce pest and disease risk and increase sustainable productivity. Potential modes of legume utilization by small ruminants - as green grazing, hay, or mature grain and straw imply different times of harvest removal with possible consequences for the subsequent barley crop. In nine two-year trials, barley following green-grazed common vetch (Vicia sativa) always outyielded barley following vetch cut as hay or harvested at maturity, albeit in some years by small and non-significant margins; mean differences in barley grain and straw yields between green-graze and mature vetch treatments were around 20 %. The main mechanisms implicated are carryover to the barley of small amounts of soil water unused by early-harvested vetch and enhanced nitrogen availability where active vetch root systems were killed by removal of the above-ground crop.

AB 1. Tropical dry woodlands are thought to be declining as a result of human activity. Aerial photograph analysis showed measurable conversion of closed canopy miombo* to sparse woodland in Lake Malawi National Park, Malawi, from 1982 to 1990. This multi-disciplinary study investigates the possible contributions to these impacts by local use of domestic fuelwood, construction poles and fuelwood for commercial fish smoking.
   2, Domestic fuelwood use was measured in 30 households over an 11-month period. Domestic fuelwood is collected by women and is headloaded to the village. It comprises a large biomass of mainly dead wood and small branches over a wide species range. Mean total annual domestic fuelwood consumption by the total enclave population was less than half the mean annual production of fallen dead wood in the Park, estimated from three quadrats harvested monthly over an 11-month period.
   3. Construction poles are mostly small, have extended durability and come from a broad species range. Fencing poles frequently take root to form live hedges. Eucalyptus trees are commonly grown for poles. Construction pole use appears sustainable and shows signs of substitution.
   4. The 305 commercial fish smoking stations in the enclaves used less fuelwood annually than domestic fuelwood users. However, the men who undertake this activity target large branches and logs from a narrow species range, involving destructive felling of canopy species. 95% of men collecting fuel for fish smoking use cutting tools and three-quarters transport the wood by boat or bicycle.
   5. The scale, size classes and species involved in commercial fish smoking suggest that this activity drives the observed degradation of closed canopy to sparse woodland. Traditional local fishing focused on small species sun-dried for preservation. Commercial fish smoking was introduced relatively recently by immigrants, along with gill netting that harvests larger fish requiring smoking for preservation. Demand for fish by ever-increasing urban populations underpins the continuing growth of the fish smoking industry.
   6. Disaggregation of different wood use practices allows informed management policy for the Park. Currently, management targets and penalizes domestic fuelwood collectors. While seeking to reduce demand and provide alternative fuelwood sources, law enforcement and forestry extension should be reorientated to address the extraction of fuelwood for fish smoking.

AB Twenty three camel calves (1.5-3.0 years) we re divided into 2 groups. Group 1 of 6 camel calves (3 males, 3 females) was stall-fed on ad libitum ration of dry groundnut (Arachis hypogea) guna/chara while group II of 17 camel calves (10 males and 7 females) sent for grazing in 3-tier silvi-pasture for 7 hours a day. The average daily gain (g/d) was significantly (p<0.01) higher in group (0.427+/-0.03) than in group II (0.237+/-0.03). The nutritive value of groundnut guna was 2.89% DCP and 8.72 MJME/kg DM and that of groundnut chara was 3.78% DCP and 8.60 MJME/kg DM in stall-fed group. Both Groundnut guna and chara had low Ca contents and thus its GIT absorption was less (-27.74 and -0.97%). Plant vigour and chemical composition of groundnut crop at different growth stages revealed continuous increase in per cent units of DM (11.67), CF (4.00) and NFE (4.39) with concomitant decrease in per cent units of CP (6.36), EE (1.88) and P(0.17). The annual sustainability of groundnut crop from 11.25 hectares was worked out to be 0.35 ACU (adult camel unit of 500 kg body weight). Cultivation of groundnut crop resulted in depletion of soil nutrients of available phosphate (29.69%) and potash (20.75%) but increase in per cent carbon (+454.90%). Plant biodiversity of 3-tier system consisted of 51.4% edible and 48.6% non-edible species besides ground cover of various grass species. The results indicated that although growth was higher in stall feeding system, better camel growth can be achieved from 3-tier system by way of plant biomass enrichment through introduction of better bushes/shrubs, trees, grasses and supplementation.

ID POVERTY; ENTITLEMENTS; GROWTH
AB Income inequality has been rising in parallel with the economic liberalisation process in the former centrally planned economies. The opportunities for non-agricultural income associated with the market liberalisation process in former centrally planned economies would seem to be important irt determining inequality within the rural sector: This article review's the trends in inequality in Viet Nam examining differential trends and hypothesised causes, Inequality is important because of its relationship to other factors in the evolution of the agricultural economy such as the incidence of poverty and the sustainability of emerging income sources. This article analyses income inequality based on data collected by the author in two Districts in coastal northern Viet Nam, The results demonstrate that non-agricultural income sources, specifically aquaculture and wage and remittance, contribute more to present inequality than any other income source. Simulation shows that the emergence of`aquaculture since the late 1980s has been driving the inequality increase in that period Hence the analysis provides evidence that non-agricultural income increases inequality even without asset concentration. This concentration olf income is important in the north Viet Nam context since if is concurrent with present-clap land allocation and will affect the structure of future income growth.

AB A distinguishing feature of decision making in the public sector is the conflicts between various objectives or priorities. Harmonized decision strategies are required to reconcile the competing values in the decision process. The decision strategies should support the decision maker to make sense out of conflicting values, goals or objectives and to arrive at a wise decision.
   The interactive learning procedure, in which multiobjective programming is solved in an interactive context, has been suggested as a method for incorporating the preferences of the decision maker thereby reaching a satisfactory compromise solution. This paper presents an interactive multiobjective programming method by which three conflicting goals, including the maximization of economic growth, the minimization of environmental pollution and the minimization of energy consumption, are compromised. The method is operationalized to find a compromise composition of sectoral outputs in the Chungbuk economy.
   The employment, pollution and energy consumption multipliers, which are required to implement the proposed method, are calculated from the Chungbuk Multiregion Input-Output Model. Then, the impact multipliers are combined with decision variables to form the objective functions of the multiobjective programming model. Four rounds of iteration have been conducted to reach the final compromise solution.
   The results of model execution show that the current distributions of output over the 12 industrial sectors are far different from the balanced allocation pattern generated by the compromise solution. If the current production structure is reorganized in accordance with the final compromise solution, the economic-energy-environmental system of Chungbuk Province will be a more balanced one.

AB Impact of farming practices on the environment and on wetlands is determined, to a great extent, by the level of farmers' environmental awareness. Effective conservation of wetlands cannot depend merely on prohibitions but instead it is necessary to investigate users' knowledge and attitudes towards these vulnerable resources and then inform and encourage sustainable use. In the present study we examine: (1) farmers' knowledge of the environmental impact of modern agriculture practised adjacent to two Ramsar wetlands, Lakes Kerkini and Prespa, and on the Plain of the Serres Basin, (2) absence of knowledge associated with characteristics of farming operations and their managers; and (3) which groups are in greater need of environmental awareness and knowledge. Data analysis revealed that the majority of farmers ignored the environmental impact of modern agriculture. Wetland farmers were more ignorant and practised a more intensive form of agriculture than those on the Plain. Prespa farmers were the most intensive farmers and were also the most ignorant with regards to water quality, soil and landscape and the use of pesticides and herbicides. This is particularly important since Prespa is a National Park. Kerkini farmers showed less environmental awareness and farmed more intensively, compared to their adjacent counterparts on the Plain. Those more 'knowledgeable' concerning environmental impacts of high input agriculture are those younger crop farmers with higher formal education and training. The findings of the study call for immediate action to implement specifically designed training programmes for wetland farmers, primarily of Prespa, so that they become more environmentally aware and eventually change their behaviour in a pro-environmental direction. This study highlights the necessity to build a conservation consensus among farmers in environmentally sensitive areas by educating them to conserve natural resources, training them to practise sustainable agriculture and rewarding the most environmentally friendly agriculture.

AB Examination of specimens collected for the international leather trade provided data on two species of large, heavy-bodied snakes: blood pythons (Python brongersmai) from northeastern Sumatra and short-tailed pythons (P. curtus) from northwestern Sumatra. Measurement and dissection of 2063 P. brongersmai and 181 P. curtus revealed broad interspecific similarities in morphology (size, shape, sexual dimorphism), food habits (feeding frequencies, dietary composition) and reproductive output (reproductive frequencies, egg sizes, and clutch sizes). Females of both species attain larger sizes than males, mature at larger sizes, and contain larger abdominal fatbodies. Python curtus is more heavy-bodied and longer-tailed than P. brongersmai, and more heavily infested with gut parasites. Both species feed almost exclusively on commensal rodents. Feeding rates increase with body size, and vary seasonally. Reproduction is highly seasonal. Adult females reproduce biennially, producing an average clutch of 12 to 16 large (mean = 83 to 90 g) eggs. The data also enable us to comment on the sustainability of the existing commercial trade, which is based mainly on adult males, and adult plus juvenile females. Anthropogenic habitat modification (especially, the establishment of oil-palm plantations) has increased the abundance of these taxa. Although neither species is likely to be extirpated by current levels of offtake, we need additional information to evaluate long-term sustainability of the commercial industry based on these snakes.

TI The conservation of saproxylic insects in tropical forests: a research
   agenda
SO JOURNAL OF INSECT CONSERVATION
LA English
DT Article
DE saproxylic insects; indicators; rapid biodiversity assessment; tropical
   forests; logging
AB Invariably, insects are overlooked when tropical forest management issues are discussed, because there are so many species, they are taxonomically intractable and so poorly known. Often people take the view that if you look after the vegetation and vertebrates, the insects will look after themselves. This may be true for some functional groups, but for saproxylic insects, this seems unlikely. Their study deserves high priority, since they are dependent on the very resource - wood - whose removal from the ecosystem is the usual object of forest management. Given the current international effort to develop 'criteria and indicators' to monitor sustainable forest management for biodiversity values, there is a window of opportunity for sound ecological research on saproxylic insects to influence the formulation of forest policy such that their needs can be taken into account. There is already a large body of knowledge on temperate and boreal region saproxylic insects, and on the effects that logging has on them, but knowledge of the tropical forest situation lags far behind. This paper proposes a research agenda to enable the needs of saproxylic insects to be taken into account in natural forest management in the tropics. Basic questions, such as whether logging has so far had an impact on tropical saproxylic insects, and whether there are workable sampling techniques to investigate this, still remain to be addressed and deserve high priority. The links between the responses of saproxylic insects and more 'charismatic' study species need to be investigated. We also need to know whether there is a correlation between the intensity of logging and the response of saproxylic insects, and, critically, whether we would be justified in measuring some surrogate aspects of forest structure (as potential habitat for saproxylic insects) rather than the saproxylic insects themselves, and modelling this to determine likely impacts of different management regimes. We consider such an ambitious research agenda as justified given the scale of impact that forest use and management is likely to have on tropical forest insects in the future.

TI A participatory approach to watershed management: The Brazilian system

DE water management; water law; social and political; public participation;
   river basin committees; water charges
AB Brazil is currently facing the challenge of implementing a new water resources management system to promote the rational and sustainable use of the country's waters. This system is based on the following principles of water management: (2) stakeholders' participation; (2) the watershed as the planning and management unit; and (3) the economic value of water. Stakeholders' participation and the involvement of civil society in the decision making process is guaranteed by permanent seats in the watersheds' management committees. These committees are the highest decision level for the establishment of water policy and for planning its use. The executive branch of the committees is the watershed agency or the water agency. This paper presents the recently approved Brazilian water resources management system and discusses the participatory approach followed to validate and to ensure prompt response to decisions regarding water use by all stakeholders. The formulation of the National Water Law (January/1998) was also supported by extensive consultation with civil society, professional associations, state and municipal governments as well as with federal governmental agencies and private sector organizations. It also presents an overview of the formulation of the National Water Law. Finally, as watershed committees have been created and are already operating in a limited number of watersheds, same of the major obstacles to the success of the new system are discussed along with alternatives for overcoming such obstacles.

AB During the dry years between 1989 and 1994, inter-basin water transfers from the Kielder system augmented flows in the River Derwent, and these flows substituted compensation releases from Del went reservoir to retain storage for supply and recreational purposes.
   The paper discusses the use of the Kielder transfers together with their impact upon (a) flow regime, (b) water quality, and (c) instream ecology of the River Derwent. Also, implications of the increasing use of water transfers in the UK are critically evaluated from the perspective of sustainability.

SO JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF NEW ZEALAND

DE Usher matrix population model; sustainable harvesting; Nothofagus;
   Dacrydium cupressinum; size-structured models; stage duration
AB Problems are identified in the use of a variant of the Usher matrix model to underpin the harvest of beech (Nothofagus spp.) and rimu (Dacrydium cupressinum) on the West Coast of the South Island. The model has been suggested as a means of determining the harvest that is sustainable in the sense of maintaining the present forest structure, and uses as inputs the size structure and estimates of size-specific radial growth rate. The model contains a bias because the equations for transition coefficients in the projection matrix assume an inappropriate geometric model for stage duration. The effect is to overestimate population growth by about 22% over a 15 year felling cycle. Alternative formulae are given for a more realistic model of fixed stage duration. The mortality rates needed to maintain the initial size structure of the population may be inferred from recursive formulae that are derived here separately for the geometric and fixed models of stage duration. Using a model with fixed stage duration it is found that the method is unworkable, in the sense that no set of mortality rates can be found to keep observed stand structures constant. The estimate of sapling recruitment number used in the harvest calculations does not appear to be well-founded. Even assuming that the forest is in a steady state and natural mortality is known, the assumption that harvest mortality substitutes for natural mortality rather than adding to it appears to be unwarranted. I suggest that matrix models cannot be used to determine ecologically sustainable forest management without additional information on natural forest dynamics and the response to harvesting.

TI Leprosy elimination through integrated basic health services in Myanmar:
   the role of midwives
SO LEPROSY REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
AB Myanmar is one of the top 16 countries identified by WHO as being hyperendemic for leprosy. Multi-drug therapy (MDT) was introduced in 1988 as a vertical programme and gradually integrated into the basic health services (BHS), achieving 100% coverage over the registered cases by 1995. To achieve maximum coverage of and benefit for patients, both leprosy vertical staff and BHS staff were trained to implement MDT whilst performing routine BHS activities. This included a total of 8615 trained midwives who were mobilized for the nationwide leprosy elimination programme (LEP). They worked at village level in various parts of the country and were willing and able to carry out basic tasks in leprosy management, such as the implementation of MDT using blister-calender packs carrying a month's supply of drugs. This study was performed to assess the workload of midwives and their attitude towards LEP. The authors conclude that midwives in Myanmar show a high level of commitment and reliability, which are essential contributing factors to achieve the current goal of leprosy elimination by the year 2000. Along with the present trend of decreasing prevalence rate, leprosy could no longer be considered as a public health problem at national level by the year 2000 in Myanmar. However, because of its long incubation period, new leprosy patients may arise even after the elimination target is achieved, whilst many other patients may become disabled. A community-based sustainable approach for the post-elimination phase, after the year 2000, will be essential and the contribution of the midwives may be of considerable importance.

Animal agriculture makes many additional contributions to human well-being, including fiber, draught power and transportation, and nutrient-recycling functions important to the efficiency and sustainability of food production systems. Projections for the future indicate large increases in per capita demand for animal food products, mostly in developing countries. There is strong evidence that increasing foods of animal origin in diets of young children with currently low levels of these foods leads to marked improvement in both physical and mental development. Prospects for the increased feed conversion efficiencies and feed supplies, including feed grains, needed to meet projected demand are discussed. Achieving the increases appears feasible, though not certain. Greater attention on a global basis to maintaining the quantity and productivity of agricultural land, and greater investment in research on both crop and animal production are needed. Ultimately food supply and other aspects of quality of life for all people are very much dependent on how soon and at what level human population is stabilized. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Animals are beneficial to humans since they produce besides food, products for medical uses and energy. They are also used for transport, animal power, fertilizer, companion and sports. Intensification of animal agriculture has allowed reasonable economic growth in developing regions. This will continue more intensively with world globalization. As a consequence, traditional family farming is losing space to the enterprise organizations concerned with profit returns on investments. This circumstance together with the mechanization of agriculture is driving human populations to the cities and producing a trend to reduce growth on the rural areas of developing countries. Animal production will continue to increase both in volume and in productivity to meet the demand for high-value protein in these transition societies. However, official authorities of developing countries should consider the environmental problems and health issues raised by animal production in the most developed areas of the world. Improved livestock productivity to support economic development and sustainable resource management are not incompatible goals. Limits for the application of technologies should consider aspects of animal production in terms of food, animal welfare and protection of the environment. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB The present topic is an analysis of the traditional society of Guadeloupe, French West Indies. The author deals with the birth of that society and its current trends; he recounts the circumstances under which the domestic animal was to be a real contribution to the daily life of the farmer. The horse is the symbol of conquest, nobility, power, and swiftness which positive qualities were also believed to be found in the overseer and master. Important as the horse's role may have been, it was played along with other animals, in particular the cattle, the donkey, the mule, the goat, the sheep and several poultry species. As a whole, that kind of farming practice was labour-saving, made transport easier for the farmer, provided more food and filled a gap in finances; moreover, domestic animals were used to take part in entertainment. On the larger sugar cane farms, where cattle became strategically less important as a consequence of motor transport, the big farmers moved to the production of milk and meat. The growing local demand in food came to be supplied by this change. As for the average citizen who had recently had access to land ownership, he kept on dealing with that kind of domestic animal farming as a sustainable means of work. Cattle became integrated into his daily life. They were used in all the major events of his family life. Consequently, their market value increased, leading to a type of capitalisation. As a result of the farming of the Creole cattle, pig, goat and sheep, tradition was maintained alive, and the farmer's life level was improved. Recently, some farmers developed official pastoral tourist events based on the skills and gifts of those animals. This recent attempt implies that there is an urgent need to set up a new research programme, in order to better identify, define and improve that heritage. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Scup (Stenotomus chrysops) were severely exercised by manual chasing for 6 min, and the clearance of lactate over a 12 hr period was evaluated. Lactate peaked from 0.5 to 1.0 hr following exercise with concentrations ranging from 61.0 to 126.0 mg/dL and returned to rested concentrations within 4 hr post-exercise. concentrations of lactate in rested fish ranged from 5.2 to approximately 23.0 mg/dL. Fish were observed for 10 days following exercise for delayed mortality. A 100% survival of scup was observed with no significant difference between control and experimental populations.
   Swimming performance was evaluated for 14.0 to 15.0 cm fork length scup, with a towed stimulus through a still-water circular swimming channel, at prolonged and burst speeds. A maximum sustainable swimming speed of 2.2 BL/sec was observed. Between the speeds of 3.0 and 3.3 BL/sec and 4.4 BL/sec, endurance time significantly deceased with the increase in swimming speed. Blood lactate concentrations were measured at 0.5 and 4.0 hr post exercise, and were used as an indicator of white muscle recruitment. A significant difference was not found between rested and experimental mean lactate concentrations at the maximum sustainable swimming speed of 2.2 BL/sec. White muscle recruitment indicated by increases in Lactic acid, was recorded at speeds above the maximum sustained swimming speed, and mean blood lactate concentrations were significantly different within blood sampling times and between swimming speeds.
   Based on the results of our investigations of lactate recovery in scup following a simulated trawl capture and escape event, we believe that scup interacting with a bottom trawl and subsequently escaping, are physiologically stressed by the event, but recover in less than 6 hr. All experimentally treated fish survived both exhaustive exercise and prolonged swimming, suggesting encounter mortality is minimal. The results of this study do not address the effects of possible physical damage on escape or the effect of multiple encounters.

SO NATURAL RESOURCES JOURNAL

ID SOCIAL-ORGANIZATION; CANAL IRRIGATION; SYSTEM
AB Using the example of indigenous irrigation on Mount Kilimanjaro, Tanzania, this paper illustrates that operating beneath the formal rules of irrigation organization is a series of "working rules" that people use to actually obtain access to water. It is argued that one of the reasons that indigenous irrigation systems are sustainable and flexible is because the working rules allow water users to adjust their formal water right to an amount anti timing of water that matches their needs more closely. If interventions into indigenous irrigation systems are to be effective and sustainable, and not undermine the institutions which govern water use within the irrigation system concerned, then development agencies need to understand, work with, and work through the working rules. This paper considers ways in which this may be achieved.

AB Nitrogen and water are both major limiting factors for agronomic production in Africa. The effect of erosion on the availability of N and water for plants is not known for major soils of the tropics. Therefore, a study was conducted to assess erosional effects on N- and water-balance on a Mollic Andosol of 9-17% slope at Lyamungu Agricultural Research and Training Institute (ARTI), Kilimanjaro region, Tanzania. Soil erosion phases were established on the basis of the topsoil depth (TSD) as an indicator of previous erosion: < 15 cm; severely eroded, 16-25 cm; moderately eroded and 26-35 cm; slightly eroded. Fill-in lysimeters (80 cm diameter, 80 cm deep) and field runoff plots (4 x 10 m) were used to monitor evapotranspiration (ET) and seepage, and N losses through erosion, runoff, leaching and plant uptake. Maize (Zea mays var. Kilima) was planted in lysimeters and runoff-plots over two cropping seasons (1995 and 1996). Rainfall and evaporation (E) were measured daily. Sediment samples from runoff plots were analysed for total N, P and C, and water samples from leachate, runoff, and rainfall were analysed for NO3-, and NH4+. There were few effects of severity of past erosion on N and water balance, but the losses of N from the system during the time of observation were very high. More than 100 and 200 kg N ha(-1) was lost in 1996 through erosion and leaching, respectively. Removal of N through plant material was about 120 kg ha(-1) in 1995 and 60 kg ha(-1) in 1996. A net depletion of 125 and 272 kg N ha(-1) was observed in 1995 and 1996, respectively. The data show that the traditional system is far from sustainable and yield decline is expected to occur in the coming years unless measures are taken to improve its N balance.

AB Southern Africa, and in particular South Africa, is blessed with extraordinary biodiversity in people, animals and plants. By Western standards, the countries of the region can be categorized as either poor or developing. While South Africa certainly is better off than its neighbours, it is nevertheless plagued by the same problems that seem to afflict developing nations elsewhere. Within developing countries it is clear that man has got out of phase, or is rapidly getting out of phase with his environment due to overpopulation. The more this happens, the more the environment is plundered and abused, usually under the umbrella of some form of advancement, the less forgiving nature becomes. The problems of uplifting the human spirit are debated ad nauseam in most of the world's cultural, agricultural, financial and political forums, seemingly with little or no respite for those most affected - people who are largely dependent on natural resources to stave off hunger, provide shelter or control disease.

TI Conservation and sustainable use of plant genetic resources in India: a
   review of policy issues and perspectives
SO OUTLOOK ON AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
AB The 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) and the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) have propelled issues relating to the conservation and sustainable use of plant genetic resources to the fore. This paper attempts an objective appraisal from India's viewpoint of these relevant but contentious issues. After taking stock of crop genetic wealth, the shortcomings in the present structure of legal framework for conservation of the nation's genetic resources are examined. Property rights in plant genetic resources are the key to their conservation and wise use. Although India is a treasure-house of plant biodiversity, demographic factors, lack of a property rights regime and general ignorance have resulted in the plundering of these invaluable natural resources. This paper's argument is that if intellectual property rights (IPR) are imaginatively adapted to actual needs, they can go a long way towards the conservation of crop genetic resources. The dilemmas that developing countries face in the post-World Trade Organization (WTO) scenario are presented on the one hand as the all-important goal of food security (which calls for agricultural intensification), and habitat conservation on the other. Finally, a framework is suggested for the conservation and sustainable use of plant genetic resources.

AB It is now clear that crop production technology and improvement programmes which work in temperate climates for large-scale intensive monoculture, cannot simply be transferred unmodified to the tropics. Tropical agriculture is dominated by small-scale extensive farming systems. Meeting the food and agricultural needs in the region therefore depends on the improvement and diversification of the cropping systems. Tropical cropping systems contribute to the sustainability of ecosystems, enhance the conservation and utilization of local crop diversity for food and agriculture, and take advantage of locally variable conditions. However, tropical agriculture has been seriously threatened by the importation of exotic crop varieties and the diminution of local ones, by the use of heavy machinery and agrochemicals, and by population growth. In order to further enhance sustainable production, more attention should be given to economically and ecologically viable adaptive research and crop variety improvement for mixed systems.

ID SHEEP
AB Mixed animal grazing is traditionally the most commonly practised method used in commercial meat production to exploit grazing land in both temperate and semi-arid areas. The increased number of variables involved compared with mono-type animal grazing offers greater opportunities to optimize the use of grazing land. Complementary grazing behaviour patterns among different animal types improve individual animal performance and output per unit of area, in a more sustainable grazing ecosystem. They can also be exploited to reduce labour requirements, improve the spread of income and reduce the risk of environmental damage. Methodology developed for temperate conditions is also suitable for semi-arid areas. The need for further research to improve our understanding of dietary intake, dietary selection and use of space under mixed grazing, limits the exploitation of the benefits outlined, particularly in making choices of animal mixes to suit differences in vegetation botanical composition, nutrient density and their geographical distribution. The need for inclusion of the socioeconomic component in extension programmes is emphasized.

AB High available aluminium and low levels of calcium below the ploughed zone of the soil are limiting factors for agricultural sustainability in the Brazilian Cerrados (Savannahs). The mineral stresses compound with dry spells effect by preventing deep root growth of cultivated plants and causes yield instability. The mode of inheritance for grain yield and mineral absorption ratio of a diallel cross in soybeans [Glycine max (L.) Merrill] grown in high and low Al areas was identified. Differences among the genotypes for grain yield were more evident in the high Al, by grouping tolerant and non-tolerant genotypes for their respective arrays in the hybrids. A large proportion of genetic variance was additive for grain yield and mineral absorption ratio in both environments. High heritability values suggest that soybeans can be improved by crosses among Al-tolerant genotypes, using modified pedigree, early generation and recurrent selection schemes.

TI Improving the repeat prescribing process in a busy general practice. A
   study using continuous quality improvement methodology
SO QUALITY IN HEALTH CARE
LA English
DT Article
ID MANAGEMENT; CARE
AB Problem
   A need to improve service to patients by reducing the time wasted by reception staff so that the 48 hour target for processing repeat prescription requests for patient collection could be achieved.
   Design
   An interprofessional team was established within the practice to tackle the area of repeat prescribing which had been identified as a priority by practice reception staff. The team met four times in three months and used continuous quality improvement (CQI) methodology (including the Plan-Do-Study-Act cycle) with the assistance of an external facilitator.
   Background and setting
   A seven partner practice serving the 14 000 patients on the northern outskirts of Bournemouth including a large council estate and a substantial student population from Bournemouth University. The repeat prescribing process is computerised.
   Key measures for improvement
   Reducing turn around times for repeat prescription requests. Reducing numbers of requests which need medical records to be checked to issue the script. Feedback to staff about the working of the process
   Strategies for change
   Using a Plan-Do-Study-Act cycle for guidance, the team decided to (a) coincide repeat medications and to record on the computer drugs prescribed during visits; (b) give signing of prescriptions a higher priority and bring them to doctors' desks at an agreed time; and (c) move the site for printing prescriptions to the reception desk so as to facilitate face to face queries.
   Effects of change
   Prescription turnaround within 48 hours increased from 95% to 99% with reduced variability case to case and at a reduced cost. The number of prescriptions needing records to be looked at was reduced from 18% to 8.6%. This saved at least one working day of receptionist time each month. Feedback from all staff within the practice indicated greatly increased satisfaction with the newly designed process.
   Lessons learnt
   The team's experience suggests that a combination of audit and improvement methodology offers a powerful way to learn about, and improve, practice. The interventions used by the team not only produced measurable and sustainable improvements but also helped the team to learn about the cost of achieving the results and provided them with tools to accomplish the aims. The importance of feedback to all staff about CQI measures was also recognised.

TI Proper utilization of solar energy in Bangladesh: effect on the
   environment, food supply and the standard of living
SO RENEWABLE ENERGY
LA English
DT Article
AB The only really sustainable form of energy is solar energy. The densely populated tropical countries can do very well from this completely sustainable energy source without any novel technologies. Most of the commercial energy used world-wide is supplied by using nonrenewable resources. Environmental damage-global warming, ozone hole, noise, chemical and radioactive waste-is due to high energy use. Environmental deterioration is a direct consequence of wealth generated and sustained by extremely cheap fossil fuel. The price of fossil fuel does not include the cost for the deterioration of the environment. We show in this paper that even a densely populated country like Bangladesh can attain a high standard of living by a proper utilization of solar energy. We suggest that poor tropical countries should mobilize their resources to develop solar technology. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB As a member of the Cairns Group, New Zealand is an excellent case for investigation of the impacts of market-based restructuring and the emergence of new mechanisms for regulation. The paper examines how agriculture in New Zealand has been impacted by economic reforms that have fundamentally changed the nature and interrelations of regulatory arrangements and economic processes. The paper sketches the origins of New Zealand's agricultural crisis and the main features of the reforms, outlines developments in several global commodity chains (meat, dairy, apples) that since the mid 1980s have shaped regulatory and governance adjustments, and explores dimensions of a reimaging of agriculture in new conditions. The paper concludes that agri-food restructuring in New Zealand is implicated in the wider integrative project of globalization. Agriculture's reconstruction reopens the scope and terms under which New Zealand labor and households might be able to participate in the agri-food sector.

SO RURAL SOCIOLOGY

ID SUSTAINABILITY
AB Australia's National Landcare Program is popularly seen as a successful attempt to address rural land degradation in a cooperative and coordinated manner. Involving everyone from community Landcare groups to the corporate sector and government agencies, "landcare" is seen to have become something bigger than the program that spawned it. In lieu of convincing evidence that Landcare has transformed agricultural practices in a demonstrably sustainable direction, this high level, of involvement is itself cited as a measure of success. Such a view however, pays little attention to competing conceptualization's of what "landcare" actually means, to the power relationships between those involved, or to the multitude of other social projects in which those involved are engaged. The failure to address these issues masks the extent to which Landcare both contributes to the further intensification of farming practices, and is used as a signifier of environmental and social responsibility in the greening of the corporate images of its sponsors. By sponsoring Landcare initiatives companies gain licensed access to use of the Landcare Australia logo and may position themselves as responsible corporate citizens, irrespective of the environmental effects of their own products and manufacturing processes. A form of "green consumerism" is thereby constituted through which consumption is directed not towards the products of farmers attempting to produce more sustainably, but towards the companies that ostensibly support their efforts to do so.

SO RURAL SOCIOLOGY

ID AGRICULTURAL PARADIGMS; PARTICIPATION
AB Farmer dependence on large-scale organizations for inputs to production is an attribute of Australian agriculture and has changed the character of farm work and how farmers see the future of agriculture. We discuss how these changes are related to farmer satisfaction with their work and their commitment to an alternative or conventional agricultural paradigm. Organic and conventional farmers are compared and findings show that organic farmers experience higher levels of work satisfaction and endorse the alternative agricultural paradigm more strongly than conventional growers. Personal success in using organic methods explains differences between organic farmers in their work satisfaction and commitments to the alternative paradigm. Similarly, conventional farmers confident about the future of their farms are satisfied with their work and express some commitment to the sustainability paradigm. Organic and conventional farmers share concerns about environmental sustainability, but are thinking differently about what sustainable farming is and how it will affect the future of Australian agriculture.

TI Green protectionism and organic food exporting from New Zealand: Crisis
   experiments in the breakdown of fordist trade and agricultural policies
SO RURAL SOCIOLOGY

ID GLOBAL AGROFOOD SYSTEM; ENVIRONMENT; SUSTAINABILITY; GLOBALIZATION;
   AGREEMENT; QUALITY; SPACE
AB The exporting of organic produce from New Zealand is a response to the ongoing breakdown of Fordist regulatory measures for agriculture in destination markets. The unambiguous neoliberal revolution in New Zealand has survived only through the expansion of food exports, especially by large corporate entities and producer marketing boards. It has also rendered the country's exporters of food products particularly sensitive to the trade and agricultural policies of the United States, Japan, and the European Union. Some commentators consider New Zealand's experiment in agricultural deregulation indicative of a wider coherence in global food trade, a new stability institutionalized in the Uruguay Round of the GATT and regulated under the auspices of the World Trade Organization. The case of organic and low-input food exporting from New Zealand shows that no such 'new times' exist. Rather, these new types of food exporting are crisis experiments induced by green protectionism-the use of health and food safety issues as an impediment to trade. In turn, green protectionism is a direct result of the continuing breakdown of Fordist agricultural regulation in key nations: the global trade in food products remains in crisis.

DE environmental impacts; gender; transportation; travel
AB Addressing unsustainable consumption patterns is an important target for fulfilling the goals set in, among others, Agenda 21 and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (1993). Gender differences in consumption patterns and their environmental impact have so far been poorly investigated. Gender differences in traveling patterns in Sweden are explored using data fi om the National Travel Survey. Such differences are shown to be large, both in terms of distances traveled, modes of transport, and energy consumption and in terms of emissions of CO2. The average CO2 emissions from mens' mode of transportation was 53% higher during 1996 compared to the CO2 emissions from womens' mode of transportation during the same year. This is due to the fact that men travel farther, but also because men travel with more energy-demanding vehicles than women. it is argued that those differences cannot be explained by differences in employment rate, but possibly by differences in sectors of employment, holder of a driving license, income, and car ownership. Gender differences in social and cultural aspects affecting environmental impacts from consumption patterns and lifestyles should not be ignored in further work for a sustainable society.

AB Sustaining soil fertility under agricultural intensification and expansion onto marginal lands is a significant challenge in the Nepalese Middle Mountains. In a detailed watershed study it was shown that the overall soil fertility is poor, forest soils display the poorest conditions as a result of biomass removal, and sustaining agriculture is questionable due to the transformation from traditional to multiple cropping systems. Parent material is a significant factor influencing low phosphorus status while insufficient inputs create deficiencies in total carbon, nitrogen and bases. A nutrient budget model was developed to assess inputs, redistribution and losses relative to soil fertility Yield, input and management data obtained from farm interviews, and soil analysis data were used in the calculation of nutrient budgets. Results from modelling indicate declining soil fertility under rainfed agriculture, forest and rangelands, and marginal conditions under irrigated agriculture subject to intensive cultivation. Nutrient deficits were relatively low for irrigated rice-wheat systems, which benefit from nutrient inputs via sediments and irrigation waters, but the introduction of triple cropping showed greater deficits. Nutrient balances were most critical under rainfed maize production where 94% of the farms were in deficit. Current shortages of organic matter make elimination of nutrient deficits problematic but improvement of composting, biological N-fixation and fertilizer efficiency and reducing erosion were found to be potential options.

AB The human element of enterprise is argued to be a vital resource for strategy execution. We show in a study of Korean businesses how an organization's commitment to its employees' well-being (OCE) can aid in the profitable execution of its positioning strategies. We found that OCE, by itself; sometimes has a weakly positive association with return on assets (ROA). But far more important, we found that ROA is strongly and positively influenced by the interaction between OCE and the dedicated pursuit of Porter's (1980) strategies for achieving competitive advantage: these are cost leadership, marketing differentiation and innovative differentiation. In short, dedicated positioning strategies appear to be executed more effectively where organizations exhibit a high level of commitment to their employees; and conversely, OCE is apt to have a strong impact on ROA only in the context of a dedicated, that is intensive and thorough, positioning strategy.

AB To deal with issues of evolution and coevolution of a Complex Adaptive System in its environment, the New Science has developed the model of adaptive walks on landscapes. This model has been used to suggest guidelines for organizational strategy in its changing environment. The approach is taken a step further to examine the issues facing an organization in four kinds of environments and, from that, to begin tentatively to draw the outlines of a strategy suited to each environment.

SO TECHNOVATION

DT Article
DE environmental; governmental; recycling; Romania; waste management
AB This paper describes a project which attempted to play some role in enabling the process of transferring knowledge between the UK and Romania. In partnership with a Romanian environmental non-governmental organisation (NGO), Powerful Information (an environmental information charity in the UK) worked towards searching out and evaluating the options available to local authorities wanting to develop more environmentally benign approaches to solid waste management, and in particular through recycling schemes. One key issue here is the role of standards as shaping technological trajectories, and the way inappropriate standards from another context can constrain local technological development. There has been a tendency for central and eastern European (CEE) countries to adopt laws and standards, resulting from an unquestioning adoption of standards from high income countries that may not be sustainable. The project described here was designed instead to identify choices and explore the process of evaluating and choosing appropriate technological systems for the particular situation that different Romanian municipalities were facing. It also examines emerging informal networks among waste management professionals and NGOs as a way of challenging this standards adopting approach to driving change in this area.

DE CIAT; commodities; region; systems; research
AB This article reviews the changes undergone by CIAT (the International Centre for Tropical Agriculture) in order to enable itself to address concerns about the sustainability of agricultural production. From its foundation, CIAT was mandated to conduct research that would promote agricultural improvement in Latin America. This work was initially focused upon the improvement of a range of discrete commodities that were important to the region served, and was conducted in a manner consistent with the 'linear' model of innovation.
   Gradually, CIAT's management and staff realised that environmental degradation threatened the long-term success of agriculture in the region. Many such problems transcend the boundaries between study of different commodities and thus become apparent at the level of larger-scale systems, of which individual commodities are merely components. To address these problems, then, it is necessary to conduct research at a level of complexity higher than that of the discrete commodity. CIAT's organisation therefore changed to include units that operated at a level of complexity appropriate to the problems under consideration. It is argued that these changes contradicted many of the prescriptions of the 'linear' model, and thus represented movement towards a new professional practice consistent with Rothwell's "fifth generation" model of innovation.

AB Armed conflict facilitates corruption and Angola presents a dramatic case study of this process. This article explores why the political context represents the key impediment to sustainable development. Solve the political problems and the gates are open for the Angolan people to reap the benefits of an abundant natural resource base with a low population density. The country has been trying to undergo three transitions simultaneously, that from war to peace, from single-party rule to multiparty democracy and from a command-based to a free-market economy. The article explores these processes and their effects on changing patterns of corruption.

AB Sustainable development has become a priority for the world's policy makers. Among the broad range of technologies with the potential to reach the goal of sustainability, biotechnology could take an important place, especially in the fields of food production, renewable raw materials and energy, pollution prevention, and bioremediation. However, technical and economic problems still need to be solved. In some cases, the environmental impact of biotechnological applications has been misjudged; in other cases, expectations cannot yet be matched.

TI Pasture degradation and restoration by legumes in humid tropical Costa
   Rica
SO TROPICAL GRASSLANDS
LA English
DT Article
ID LIVESTOCK PRODUCTIVITY ASSESSMENT; ATLANTIC ZONE; LOWLANDS
AB A system-analytical approach was used to quantify effects of degradation of naturalised pastures and to explore options for restoration by sustainable legume-based pastures in beef production systems in the northern Atlantic Zone (AZ) of Costa Rica. As well as field level analyses, the whole northern AZ is considered by taking competition for land among cattle ranching, cropping and forestry into account. Current beef production systems are unsustainable, with soil-nitrogen mining calculated at 50-65 kg/ha annually. Over time, stocking rate, pasture area, pasture production and economic returns will decrease. Once naturalised pasture production reaches approximate to 5 t dry matter/ha/yr, half of the current pasture area is expected to be abandoned and beef production to drop to 25% of the current level. Replacement of degrading naturalised pastures by sustainable grass-legumes will maintain beef production at some 90% of its current level. Compared with the end-point for the beef cattle sector if current soil-mining practices continue, this replacement results in a gain of some US $7.1 M/yr in economic surplus. The break-even point for individual farmers for replacement of naturalised pastures by grass-legumes depends on the type of production system, soil resources and pasture age. For some farmers, this moment is already here, whereas for others, it is economically attractive to postpone this replacement for a number of years.

DE international river basins; transboundary water resources; international
   water law; dispute resolution; shared river management; European Union
AB Water is increasingly perceived as a strategic resource for the twenty-first century. A new framework for the management of water resources in international river basins is necessary to overcome some of the persistent conflicts related to international rivers. This article provides a general description of transboundary issues related to international watercourses, with a focus on situations involving European Union Member States. The rapid evolution of environmental management concepts. at the international and global levels will have a clear impact on the approaches adopted by the international community with respect to international rivers. New concepts, principles, and mechanisms are being: developed to help incorporate all the complexity of environmental concerns in transboundary river management. Sustainable development, shared responsibility, hydrodiplomacy, subsidiarity, the epistemic communities' approach, and public involvement appear to be some of the keywords for the near future. Global agreements dealing with all aspects of water resources management should be put forward under a common general framework, and aspects of planning, management, and operation should be explicitly addressed in specific agreements. This is essential in order to achieve an adequate balance and integration between the social environmental, technical, legal, and institutional dimensions of existing problems. The new Convention on Non-Navigational Uses of Water, being put forward by the United Nations, is a significant effort in this long and difficult process of solving water-related international disputes.

AB Planning for sustainable development of water resources relies crucially on the data available. Continuous hydrologic simulation based on conceptual models has proved to be the appropriate tool for studying rainfall-runoff processes and for providing necessary data. In recent years, artificial neural networks have emerged as a novel identification technique for the modelling of hydrological processes. However, they represent their knowledge in terms of a weight matrix that is not accessible to human understanding at present. This paper introduces genetic programming, which is an evolutionary computing method that provides a 'transparent' and structured system identification, to rainfall-runoff modelling. The genetic-programming approach is applied to flow prediction for the Kirkton catchment in Scotland (U.K.). The results obtained are compared to those attained using two optimally calibrated conceptual models and an artificial neural network. Correlations identified using data-driven approaches (genetic programming and neural network) are surprising in their consistency considering the relative size of the models and the number of variables included. These results also compare favourably with the conceptual models.

AB More than 70 empirical studies indicate that local population growth and its microeconomic manifestations in hills and mountains of developing countries do not necessarily threaten forest production, agriculture, livestock production, or watershed stability. Population growth can make the cost of land relative to labor increase. As this cost increases, people often change their methods of managing economic plants and animals and make land improvements to offset initial declines in productivity that result from more frequent use of land. Thus, the relationship between land productivity and relative land-labor costs often resembles a 'U'. Halting population growth or removing people from well-settled areas might not improve productivity or reduce some off-site damages. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In Africa, the economic and social impacts of large dams on communities inhabiting floodplains downstream have mostly been adverse. Most studies of the impacts of darns have been short term, however, and confined to the years immediately following dam closure. This paper takes a longer term perspective, examining the changes that have occurred in the 20 years since the construction of the Tiga Dam in northern Nigeria. The paper shows that despite adverse short-term environmental impacts of dam construction (exacerbated by drought), in the longer term, farmers have managed to adapt their agriculture in the floodplain. Factors important in this adaptation include the effects of environmental change themselves and the availability of new agricultural technologies, although, there are indicators which suggest that in some cases this increased level of production may not be sustainable. The implications of the response of floodplain farmers to desiccation over a period of decades are discussed. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The high incidence of disease is one of the major constraints to smallholder poultry production systems in Africa. In order to control various poultry diseases, ethnoveterinary medicine is widely practised by poor village farmers. Natural products, especially those which are locally available, are generally used. The use of ethnoveterinary medicine can be considered sustainable as it is economical, culturally acceptable and ecologically sound. Although village poultry farmers claim that these practices are effective, there is an urgent need for applied research to substantiate their assertions.

AB Objective: HIV-induced CD4 lymphocyte depletion is partially reversed by antiretroviral therapy but it is unclear if the degree to which the CD4 count rises depends on viral suppression (if so, the extent of viral suppression required to achieve a maximal CD4 count rise), whether the rise is sustainable and whether it occurs in patients with CD4 count <10 x 10(6) cells/l. We aimed to address these Issues.
   Methods: We studied CD4 count and plasma HIV RNA values every 4 weeks for 72 weeks in 154 patients starting indinavir-containing regimens.
   Results: Mean baseline HIV RNA and CD4 count were 4.8 log(10) copies/ml and 180 x 10(6) cells/l, respectively. Overall, there was a mean increase in CD4 count of 143 x 10(6) cells/l by 72 weeks. The adjusted mean increase (adjusted for initial viral load, CD4 count and age) was strongly related to the mean viral suppression over the follow-up period (P < 0.0001). Importantly, there was a highly significant difference (P = 0.0004) in the rise in CD4 count between those with 2-3 log suppression (161 x 10(6) cells/l) and those with > 3 log suppression (314 x 10(6) cells/l; mean 3.6 log suppression in this group), suggesting that with even greater suppression the rise in CD4 lymphocytes may be still larger. We also studied whether CD4 counts were still rising after 72 weeks in patients with sustained suppression of at least 3 log in viral load. There was a significant (P = 0.004; paired t-test) rise in count of 43 x 10(6) cells/l between weeks 64 and 72 in these patients, suggesting that regeneration continues at least up to 72 weeks after therapy, provided virus replication continues to be suppressed. Patients with initial CD4 counts < 10 x 10(6) cells/l experienced no smaller rises than those at higher levels, even after adjustment for other factors.
   Conclusion: These results strongly support a direct causal relationship between HIV replication and CD4 lymphocyte count depletion. The rise in those with > 3 log suppression provides the best available indicator of the potential for natural CD4 regeneration in HIV-infected patients. However, since stilt greater CD4 count rises may be seen with more suppressive regimens, it may not be possible to study the intrinsic CD4 regenerative capacity until such regimens are available.

ID REEF FISHES; RECRUITMENT; POPULATIONS
AB Marine reserves have been proposed as a remedy for overfishing and declining marine biodiversity, but concern that reserves would inherently reduce yields has impeded their implementation. It was found that management of fisheries through reserves and management through effort control produce identical yields under a reasonable set of simplifying assumptions corresponding to a broad range of biological conditions. Indeed, for populations with sedentary adults (invertebrates and reef fishes), reserves have important advantages for sustainability, making marine reserves the preferred management approach.

AB Recent predictions of growth in human populations and food supply suggest that there will be a need to substantially increase food production in the near future. One possible approach to meeting this demand, at least in part, is the control of pests and diseases, which currently cause a 30-40% loss in available crop production. In recent years, strategies for controlling pests and diseases have tended to focus on short-term, single-technology interventions, particularly chemical pesticides. This model frequently applies even where so-called integrated pest management strategies are used because in reality, these often are dominated by single technologies (e.g., biocontrol, host plant resistance, or bio-pesticides) that are used as replacements for chemicals. Very little attention is given to the interaction or compatibility of the different technologies used. Unfortunately, evidence suggests that such approaches rarely yield satisfactory results and are unlikely to provide sustainable pest control solutions for the future. Drawing on two case histories, this paper demonstrates that by increasing our basic understanding of how individual pest control technologies act and interact, new opportunities for improving pest control can be revealed. This approach stresses the need to break away from the existing single-technology, pesticide-dominated paradigm and to adopt a more ecological approach built around a fundamental understanding of population biology at the local farm level and the true integration of renewable technologies such as host plant resistance and natural biological control, which are available to even the most resource-poor farmers.

AB The transition to sustainable growth in agricultural production during the 21st century will take place within the context of a transition to a stable population and a possible transition to a stable level of material consumption. If the world fails to successfully navigate a transition to sustainable growth in agricultural production, the failure will be due more to a failure in the area of institutional innovation than to resource and environmental constraints.

AB The recent intensification of agriculture, and the prospects of future intensification, will have major detrimental impacts on the nonagricultural terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems of the world. The doubling of agricultural food production during the past 35 years was associated with a 6.87-fold increase in nitrogen fertilization, a 3.48-fold increase in phosphorus fertilization, a 1.68-fold increase in the amount of irrigated cropland, and a 1.1-fold increase in land in cultivation. Based on a simple linear extension of past trends, the anticipated next doubling of global food production would be associated with approximately 3-fold increases in nitrogen and phosphorus fertilization rates, a doubling of the irrigated land area, and an 18% increase in cropland. These projected changes would have dramatic impacts an the diversity, composition, and functioning of the remaining natural ecosystems of the world, and on their ability to provide society with a variety of essential ecosystem services. The largest impacts would be on freshwater and marine ecosystems, which would be greatly eutrophied by high rates of nitrogen and phospho rus release from agricultural fields. Aquatic nutrient eutrophication can lead to loss of biodiversity, outbreaks of nuisance species, shifts in the structure of food chains, and impairment of fisheries. Because of aerial redistribution of various forms of nitrogen, agricultural intensification also would eutrophy many natural terrestrial ecosystems and contribute to atmospheric accumulation of greenhouse gases. These detrimental environmental impacts of agriculture tan be minimized only if there is much more efficient use and recycling of nitrogen and phosphorus in agroecosystems.

AB The effluents from coal washeries cause serious pollution problems to surface waters. Models have been developed to evaluate the dispersion of pollutants in the river. For the removal of suspended solids from the coal washery effluents the aid of a synthetic flocculant was found to be very effective in terms of settling rate, retention time and cost. For sustainable water supplies to the coal washeries the methodology developed was found to be very effective and may also be applicable to other washeries. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Most trees in the Negev desert, Israel, are either Acacia raddiana, A. tortilis or A. negevensis. They provide food and shelter for many desert animals and are a major source of livestock feed and firewood for the native Bedouin people. High mortality and low recruitment of these trees have been reported. To develop sustainable conservation strategies it is necessary to understand the population dynamics of the Acacia trees. Therefore, on the basis of demographic data gained by field studies, a spatially-explicit, individual-based computer simulation model of the population dynamics of A. raddiana has been developed. We evaluate the relative importance of different processes such as seed production and seed infestation by parasites, germination, mortality, and mistletoe infestation to the survival and recruitment of Acacia trees in the Negev. Mortality rates at different life stages, the production of uninfested seeds and the weather regime were most influential. The infection of trees by semi-parasitic mistletoes proved to be of minor importance. The most important result is that an increase in the germination rate of Acacia seeds, such as may result from passage through the digestive tract of large mammalian herbivores, is capable of counteracting the detrimental effect of unfavourable climatic conditions. Consequently, we discuss the use of increased large mammalian herbivore densities as a possible management option for enhancing the survival of Acacia populations in the Negev.

AB The State Government had adopted the principles of Montreal Process Criteria and Indicators for sustainable management of forests in Victoria. The performance measures and operating standards for quantifying the Montreal Process soil indicators 4a, 4d, and 4e were reviewed and developed with particular reference to the Victorian Central Highlands forest. A simple framework for estimating the extent of total soil disturbance on harvesting coupes is presented. The performance measures and operating standards for each indicator and the framework were applied and evaluated over 20 coupes in this forest. Following harvesting and site preparation, the proportion of the coupe area affected was 22-45% associated with the indicator 4a, 12-45% associated with the indicator 4d, and 38-51% associated with the indicator 4e. The total area affected varied depending on type of forest operations, type of measure and levels of operating standard used. Using a 20% operating standard for bulk density and 30% operating standard for organic matter content, it was found that the total area affected varied from 38 to 52% of the coupe area. The major source of detrimental soil disturbance and methods for minimising soil impact were identified. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Stand structure, disturbance histories, and patterns of tree replacement of three conifer-dominated stands growing on glacial terraces, differing in age, were investigated. Regeneration patterns of the conifers Dacrydium cupressinum, Manoao colensoi, Prumnopitys ferruginea and Phyllocladus alpinus were inferred from age and size (diameter) distributions, the spatial distribution of tree ages, and tree locations. Disturbance histories and patterns of tree replacement were reconstructed from age distributions, the spatial distribution of tree ages, and tree locations. Disturbance histories were related to soil drainage which was inferred from the depth of rusting on mild steel rods inserted across each stand. Stands differed in structure and composition, reflecting different patterns of disturbance. Manoao colensoi and Dacrydium cupressinum were established in response to catastrophic disturbance on extremely poorly drained soils on the oldest terrace. On less poorly drained soils, Dacrydium cupressinum, Prumnopitys ferruginea and Phyllocladus alpinus were established in response to smaller canopy gap formation from intermittent windthrow and synchronous canopy collapse. A secular model of stand dynamics is envisaged across the glacial terraces, reflecting an even long-term soil development, where the chance of catastrophic disturbance will increase as soils become increasingly poorly drained over millennia. The implications of these findings for sustainable forest management are discussed. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

ID MANAGEMENT
AB A comprehensive reference system for the Earth's river basins is proposed as a support to river basin management, global change research, and the pursuit of sustainable development. A natural system for delineation and codification of basins is presented which is based upon topographic control and the topology of the river network. These characteristics make the system well suited for implementation and use with digital elevation models (DEMs) and geographic information systems. A demonstration of these traits is made with the 30-arcsecond GTOPO30 DEM for North America. The system has additional appeal owing to its economy of digits and the topological information that they carry. This is illustrated through presentation of comparisons with USGS hydrologic unit codes and demonstration of the use of code numbers to reveal dependence or independence of water use activities within a basin.

AB The conservation of biodiversity requires a significant commitment by governments, industry sectors and the wider community to encourage cultural change across community and industry sectors which ensures a long-term balance between sustainable land management and biodiversity conservation. At the regional level viable biodiversity conservation requires a range of management strategies that may include the establishment of statutory protected areas, a range of off-park conservation management measures and achievable guidelines for ecologically sustainable land management at the landscape scale. Monitoring the performance of protected areas in achieving biodiversity conservation requires a commitment by government to facilitate involvement and participation of the wider community. Four Australian case studies discuss how public-private conservation partnerships are integrating sustainable land management and biodiversity conservation at the regional level.

AB Multiple micronutrient deficiencies in the perinatal phase are associated with poor child growth and functional impairment. For the pastoral child there is additional risk due to lifestyle and isolation from healthcare. Successful improvement in the child-rearing practices and maternal vitamin A and iron status requires community-based interventions that are sustainable. It is therefore recommended that for pastoral communities participatory techniques that identify and mobilize community resources should be used in the implementation of intervention programes.

AB The continuing debate on sustainability has raised wide concerns towards integration of environmental and eco; nomic aspects into the development decision-making process. This paper develops a framework for environmental-economic decision making that includes the environmental and economic sustainability criteria, and local people's preferences in the context of a lowland irrigated agriculture system using multi-criteria decision-making techniques. Several criteria, such as land capability/suitability, energy input/output ratio, water demand and environmental costs, are considered as environmental sustainability criteria. Economic sustainability is measured from farmers': governments and societal viewpoints using extended cost-benefit analysis. The Geographic Information System (GIS) technique has been used to evaluate spatial sustainability criteria. The involvement of local people at various levels of the decision- making process is emphasized and their opinions are sought in the decision-making process using a two-stage field survey. The results of the multi-criteria analysis combining both environmental and economic sustainability criteria are discussed, and economic incentives for sustainable intensification of lowland irrigated agriculture are outlined.

AB The shortage of water resources of good quality is becoming an important issue in the arid and semi-arid zones. For this reason the availability of water resources of marginal quality such as drainage water, saline groundwater and treated wastewater has become an important consideration. Nevertheless, the use of these waters in irrigated lands requires the control of soil salinity by means of leaching and drainage of excess water and salt. However, the leaching of salts, soil microelements and agro-chemicals can lower the quality of the drainage water in the irrigation scheme. The irrigation return flows with water or poor quality are a source of pollution of the surface water bodies situated downstream of the drainage outlet. Deep percolation could also contaminate the groundwater. Therefore, irrigation with saline water requires a comprehensive analysis even beyond the area where water is applied. The problem should be treated beyond the scope of the irrigation scheme, taking into consideration the groundwater and downstream surface water resources of the river basin. Consequently, the sustainable use of saline water in irrigated agriculture requires the control of soil salinity at the field level, a decrease in the amount of drainage water, and the disposal of the irrigation return flows in such a way that minimizes the side effects on the quality of downstream water resources. This paper describes the guidelines for a preliminary evaluation of the suitability of water for irrigation and the key factors for salinity control in lands irrigated with saline water. Options to improve the quality of the drainage water, strategies for the reuse of this water and alternatives for disposal of the outflow are also analysed. The final goal is to obtain sustainable agriculture and maintain the quality of the water resources in the river basin. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The great expansion of irrigated lands using groundwater has often caused the exploitation of aquifer reserves beyond their recharge capacity. The development of management tools which can harmonize resource exploitation with reserve sustainability is the objective of an interesting experience being accomplished in the aquifer 08.29 in Mancha Oriental, Spain. This paper offers a summary of this ongoing project (GESMO), pointing out the specific role of the irrigation Advisory Service. The general objective of the project is to create an integrated and integral management system of the aquifer as well as to prepare appropriate techniques for its adequate exploitation. Integral management means that both supply and demand management are considered, including the socio-economic and environmental perspectives. The concept of integrated management implies that the process must involve the majority of economic and social agents affected.
   Management is founded on a Decision Support System (DSS) which takes into consideration different possible options. The DSS must contemplate the impacts on the environment, mainly the aquifer reserve losses and the increase of nitrates concentration in groundwater. The project directly affects more than 5000 agricultural users, irrigating about 100000 ha with the aquifer water resources, as well as the whole population living in this region. Results of this project, including irrigation technologies developed may be useful for other areas in the Mediterranean Basin where similar cases occur. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB The sustainable exploitation of water resources requires planning and control methods that allow the incorporation of a great number of spatial and temporal variables. Because of its features, a Geographic Information System (GIS) seems the most suitable tool to aid in the management of available hydric resources. In this study, we have developed a specific GIS within the GESMO Project in order to better manage the 08-29 aquifer system (Mancha Oriental). This tool is intended for use by the JCRMO: Junta Central de Regantes de Ia Mancha Oriental (General Board of Irrigation Users of Eastern La Mancha), the organism responsible for aquifer management. This system is designed to integrate information from different sources, such as remote sensing, fieldwork data or administrative files with the cadastral subplot as a common reference. One of its functions is to expedite the control and monitoring, in real time, of the exploitation plans, which constitute the legal instrument to regulate water extractions. It will allow us to estimate the spatial and temporal distribution of water extractions needed for crops and their irrigation systems. These estimates will be highly valuable for aquifer modelling. The system also permits display of information on maps for easy handling. This visualisation allow users to more readily participate in decision-making processes. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Sustainable agricultural development requires technologies and practices that make more efficient and productive use of resources and an enabling environment that encourages the adoption of these technologies. Many institutions and international agencies are showing considerable interest in integrated catchment management (ICM) as a practical means of improving the management of water resources, reducing environmental degradation and promoting sustainable agricultural development. This paper outlines some of the main components of ICM and lists some of the prerequisites for establishing collective responsibility for, in particular, groundwater resources. This paper also discusses the extent to which programmes of ICM can be used as a means of conserving water resources and improving water use efficiency and productivity at the farm and catchment scales.

AB Since scarcity of water is a major problem in semi-arid and arid areas of Spain and many other Mediterranean regions, water consumption in irrigated agriculture has to be reduced to a sustainable level that is also adapted to the environment. This goal can be reached by applying the highly effective and resource preserving techniques of micro-irrigation. In order to improve these techniques, a new subsurface irrigation system was developed by modification of conventional subsurface systems through the following innovative elements:
   a new design of the lateral hoses which prevents the penetration of roots into the external water outlets and the block up by soil particles;
   an impermeable polyethylene foil placed below the lateral pipes to prevent water loss through deep percolation especially in sandy substrates;
   a special installation equipment consisting of a V-shaped device which releases foil and pipe simultaneously into the soil without disturbing the natural soil profile.
   After the experience of several years of operation, these elements have proved to be highly effective. Compared to other irrigation methods, the high irrigation efficiency achieved by this system was outstanding. Minimum maintenance requirement and a long life span are additional positive characteristics of the system. The beneficial outcomes of this system give reason for an optimistic appraisal of the strategies involved towards sustainable irrigated agriculture. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Increased interest in sustainable low-input forms of agriculture has focused attention on the role of beneficial soil microsymbionts, such as arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), in plant productivity and health. Root colonisation by AMF and AMF spore density was significantly lower in grassland soils with a history of high-input, conventional management than in soils with a low-input or organic management. Spores of AMF isolated from contrasting management regimes, taken from a total of 24 sites at 13 farms, were used in a series of inoculation trials involving three host plants (Allium ameloprasum L., Trifolium repens L. and Lolium perenne L.). The mean yield response (measured as shoot dry weight) was significantly greater when host plants were inoculated with spores taken from farms with organic rather than high-input management for both Allium and Trifolium hosts. Very low levels of root infection in Lolium hosts excluded these plants from further analysis. Not all organic farms had highly effective AMF associations however, and some highly effective AMF isolates were found in high-input systems. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The importance of nitrogen (N), weeds, and water as yield-limiting factors was evaluated over a 4-year period in tomato crapping systems under conventional, low-input, and organic management. The cropping systems studied were part of the Sustainable Agriculture Farming Systems (SAFS) Project at the University of California, Davis, a comparison of conventional and alternative farming systems in California's Sacramento Valley. Water applied, soil N levels, plant N uptake, weed abundance, and tomato yield were measured and compared among treatments. Tomato yields ranged from just under 55 to over 90 t ha(-1) and significant treatment differences were observed in 2 of the 4 years. Multivariate analyses, used to sort out the effects of N, weeds, and water, indicated all three factors influenced yields in this study but their relative importance was dependent upon the management system. Results indicated that N availability was most important in limiting yields in the organic system and water availability was more important under conventional management. Although weed abundance was relatively high in the organic system in 2 years of the study, weed competition for N was not evident. Instead, relative N input levels and N immobilization by soil microflora appeared to explain N uptake and tomato yield variation. The findings indicate that organic and low-input tomato systems in this region can produce yields similar to those of conventional systems but that the factors limiting yield may be more difficult to manage.

Because the production of children's capabilities creates a public good that cannot be priced in the market, individuals can free ride on the efforts of parents in general and mothers in particular. We need to redesign the social contract in ways that encourage more sustainable forms of intergenerational altruism and reciprocity.

AB . Sustainability is an important quality of the types of agriculture nowadays promoted in central Europe, notably biological agriculture and integrated production. Agronomists, decision-makers and the public generally assume that this agricultural sustainability implies the maintenance of species diversity. However, this assumption often does not hold true. This is shown in a case study of moderately ferti-lized Arrhenatheretum meadows in northern Switzerland. Earlier and more frequent mowing, simultaneous harvesting of all the grasslands in a region, and ecological changes in surrounding arable fields, hedges and other ecosystems often cause a decline in plant and animal species richness, while agricultural yield does not noticeably change. To emphasize the distinction the concept of biocenotic sustainability is proposed for describing the capability of a community to maintain its species composition and structure. For maintaining or attaining biocenotic sustainability. results of modern ecology have to be taken into account, e.g. the theories of island biogeography, minimum viable populations, dispersal, and metapopulations. There is evidence that biocenotic sustainability always implies sustainability of agricultural yield.

TI Fire as a tool in the management of a savanna/dry forest reserve in
   Madagascar
SO APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE

AB . The possible use of fire for the management of the Ankarafantsika Reserve in the northwest of Madagascar and of its surrounding area is studied. Within this savanna landscape large parts of the remaining dry forests still exist with a unique biotic diversity, both in terms of total number of species and endemism. Unfortunately, mainly man-induced uncontrolled fires threaten these forests. Actual and former fire regimes of the local communities are analysed. The use of fire is an integrated part of land use and is also governed by socio-cultural traditions. The impact of fire on the dynamics of dry forests and grass savannas is studied considering the specifics of different fire regimes. We propose that a deliberate and controlled use of fire respecting the vegetation stage and the defined objectives could be an appropriate management tool. The strategy of a fire management is elaborated considering both the conservation of biodiversity and improvement of the livelihood of the local population depending upon the Reserve's resources. Obviously, a sustainable management of the natural resources requires a substantial participation of the community.

AB We investigated the densities of the Redwing Francolinus levaillantii and Greywing Francolins F. africanus and the diversity of grassland birds in general along a land-use gradient in the highlands of Mpumalanga province, South Africa. Redwing Francolins cannot tolerate intensive grazing and frequent burning and are confined largely to unburnt, ungrazed grasslands. Their density and the species richness of grassland birds in general are negatively correlated with grazing intensity. Redwing populations drop to densities that cannot be utilised by hunters on a sustainable basis in grasslands that are grazed at even moderate levels or burned annually. Nineteen bird species (including five threatened species) were confined to essentially pristine grassland and were never observed in grazed/annually burned grasslands. The Greywing Francolin is more evenly distributed (although always at sub-utilisation densities) along the grassland land-use gradient, and its density is positively correlated with grazing intensity. There are two assemblages of grassland bird species that appear to be indicative of the intensity of habitat utilisation. Populations of grassland birds in the study area are becoming increasingly dependent on isolated patches of pristine grassland and are threatened by management involving annual burning and high stocking rates on a landscape scale.

AB When the Kosi Bay Nature Reserve was proclaimed in 1986 there was a thriving traditional fishery, based on trapping fish, and a growing recreational fishery. In 1992 the Reserve Authorities instituted an experimental gillnet fishery to establish if it were possible to develop and implement a new fishery targeting fish species thought to be able to sustain further fishing pressure. The results and implications of the fishery were analysed both in terms of fish catches and broader conservation goals. The fishery was begun in one area and apparent success there led to its expansion and by the end of 1995 there were four gillnet committees issuing a total of 35 permits to their communities. Various problems arose during the development of the project and these were dealt with through the committees. Of the 88,964 fish caught during the period April 1992 to December 1995, 84.6% were of species designated as "target" as they were perceived to be able to sustain increased fishing pressure. Catch levels appeared to be sustainable and impacts on conservation priority species, such as crocodiles, Crocodilus niloticus, and ecological factors such as annual fish spawning migrations, were assessed and found to be minimal. Communities within and surrounding the Nature Reserve were initially neutral or hostile to the Reserve authorities but by December 1995 relations had imroved considerably and a degree of joint management had been achieved.

ID MANAGEMENT
AB The outcomes from a survey of developer and related organizations active in a local industrial property market in mid-1998 are reported in respect of the use and reuse of industrial buildings. The discussion focuses on both refurbishment and reuse and new build sectors, and draws out some evidence on sustainability issues. Despite a relatively limited understanding of sustainability as a concept, developers are found to have a positive attitude to reuse when conditions allo rv it. Indeed, those more actively involved in reuse have sometimes engaged in a variety of practical, sustainable solutions to refurbishment needs, Most are open to influence on questions of good practice and sustainability. This all suggests that legislation designed to turn the development and construction industry towards brownfield opportunities and the sustainable reuse of existing infrastructure is likely to induce a favourable response.

AB Soil organic matter is important both from an agronomic and an environmental perspective because it affects the capacity of the soil to sustain crop growth, and it is a source and sink of atmospheric CO2-C. Soil microbial biomass comprises a small proportion of total soil organic matter, but it is more dynamic than total soil organic matter. Therefore, measurements of soil microbial biomass may show the effects of soil management on potential changes in soil organic matter before such effects can be detected by measuring total soil organic matter. The effects of tillage and crop rotation on soil microbial biomass and activity were studied in 1995-1997 in the wheat phase of different cropping rotations that had been established in 1992 under zero tillage or conventional tillage in northern Alberta. Soil microbial biomass was often significantly (P < 0.05) higher, but never significantly lower, under zero tillage than under conventional tillage. However, CO2 evolution (basal respiration) was usually higher under conventional tillage than under zero tillage, resulting in higher specific respiration (qCO(2)) under conventional tillage than under zero tillage. The higher additions but lower losses of labile C under zero tillage mean that more C is sequestered in the soil in the zero-tillage system. Thus, this system contributes less to atmospheric CO2 than conventional tillage, and that soil organic matter accumulates more under zero tillage. Plots preceded by summerfallow, especially under conventional tillage, usually had the lowest microbial biomass and CO2 evolution, and plots preceded by legume crops had higher microbial biomass and lower qCO(2) than other treatments. Tillage and rotation had little effect on total soil organic matter 5 yr after the treatments had been imposed, probably because of the cold climate of northern Alberta, but the results confirm that the labile forms of soil C are more sensitive indicators of soil organic C trends than total soil organic C. These effects of tillage and rotation on soil microbial biomass were similar to those on microbial diversity reported previously. These results confirm that zero tillage and legume-based crop rotations are more sustainable crop management systems than conventional tillage and fallowing in the Gray Luvisolic soils of northern Alberta.

AB To reveal trends in the design and operation of multi-functional, multi-phase reactors, this paper describes, in historical sequence, three industrial applications of multi-functional, multi-phase reactors developed and operated by Shell Chemicals during the last five decades. For each case, we describe the design requirements, the design knowledge that was used and how the reactor was designed conceptually. In addition, we also indicate what development methods, models and tools were applied, and how commercial start-up and operation went.
   Due to an increased demand for processes that produce no waste, require little energy, are low in cost and produce products of excellent quality, it is expected that more multi-functional reactors will be developed and operated in future. These reactors will be conceptually designed using increasingly systematic methods, in which all requirements - Safety, Health and Environment, Sustainability, Product Quality and Low Cost - are first translated into functions. Requirements are thus combined as much as possible on a functional level after which the appropriate equipment is designed. Reliable start-up and operation will be increasingly achieved by the modelling of all individual functions and integration of these functions into comprehensive reactor models together with well designed, small-scale experiments.

AB The undervaluation of natural products and ecological services generated by mangrove ecosystems is a major driving force behind the conversion of this system into alternative uses. This trend of undervaluation is partly due to the difficulty involved in placing a monetary value on all relevant factors, but lack of ecological knowledge and a holistic approach among those performing the evaluation may be even more important determinants. This article identifies and synthesizes ecological and biophysical links of mangroves that sustain capture fisheries and aquaculture production. Fish, crustacean and mollusc species associated with mangroves are presented and the ecology of their direct use of this system is reviewed. Through a coastal seascape perspective, biophysical interactions among mangroves, seagrass beds and coral reefs are illustrated. The life-support functions of mangrove ecosystems also set the framework for sustainable aquaculture in these environments. Estimates of the annual market value of capture fisheries supported by mangroves ranges from US$750 to 16 750 per hectare, which illustrates the potential support value of mangroves. The value of mangroves in seafood production would further increase by additional research on subsistence fisheries, biophysical support to other ecosystems, and the mechanisms which sustain aquaculture production.

TI Metropolitan development as a complex system: A new approach to
   sustainability
SO ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT QUARTERLY
LA English
DT Article
AB A major national debate is under way about the effects of the regulation of development and land use patterns on metropolitan economies. Because this is often framed around whether sprawling development patterns are harmful or beneficial to the economy and environment, we are seemingly presented with an either/or choice. This article asserts that the debate misses the reality that metropolitan development occurs as part of a complex system. if we view metropolitan development as a complex system, there is no fundamental conflict between environmental goals and economic development. Examining the case of California, the authors demonstrate how the relationship between these is part of a larger system involving fiscal policy, governance structure, infrastructure policy, and other factors. The authors propose three strategies for improving metropolitan system performance to ensure sustainable metropolitan economies and environments: developing and using indicators for self-organizing urban systems, collaboration and consensus building among metropolitan stakeholders, and metropolitan leadership.

TI Dynamic feedback optimization of bioresource management in a polluted

SO ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
LA English
DT Article
ID MODEL
AB A single state bioresource management model was derived from the viewpoint of control engineering based on a nonlinear and stochastic dynamic system. The model can be used to solve the problem regarding the analysis and management of biological resources in the presence of uncertainty and the implication of uncertainty in decision making. The management of trace Zn bioaccumulation in aquaculture abalone, Haliotis diversicolor supertexta, is illustrated to show the applicability of established techniques in designing a dynamic feedback control strategy. General results from the engineering analysis are presented in the form of strategies of constant Zn concentration in molluskan shellfish and of constant control effort and in the form of warning about the instability of the system. Numerical data were obtained which could be used to design a controller minimizing fluctuations about a chosen equilibrium state. Dynamic feedback optimization can serve as a guide to the decision making of sustainable bioresource management in a polluted ecosystem in that the decisions are required to be made in the presence of uncertainty.

TI Strategic environmental assessment of hydrological and irrigation plans
   in Castilla y Leon, Spain
SO ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
AB The study illustrates how strategic environmental assessment (SEA) can promote sustainable development plans. It defines and applies an SEA methodology to two draft plans: the hydrological plan for the Duero basin in Spain and the irrigation plan for the region of Castilla y Leon. Although prepared by national and regional authorities, respectively, both draft plans refer to the management and use of water as a resource for economic development and refer roughly to the same area. The SEA addresses the environmental, economic, and social impacts of the combined draft plans, using relevant indicators and objectives. The analysis shows that the proposals would lead to high financial costs and significant negative impacts on the environment for each job created; it develops and assesses a number of alternatives that would address these impacts. The results are used to define SEA procedures for the new Structural Funds period (2000-2006) and will provide a useful lesson for plans at all levels of government within Spain.

TI Mount stirling: Political and environmental convergence for sustainable
   development
SO ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
AB The paper briefly reports the environmental impact assessment (EIA) process undertaken in 1994-1996 into the future of Mount Stirling in Victoria, Australia, which was targeted for development as an integrated ski resort. The EIA process was preceded by extreme controversy about the proposed use of the mountain for downhill skiing and the use of a legal injunction to stall the proposed development. It represents a rare example where government used the EIA process to find the best overall solution to a public policy issue. A consultative committee (including interest groups and community representatives) was involved in scoping the environmental impact statement (EIS), writing the study brief; selecting a consultant, and guiding the preparation of the EIS. A framework for evaluating alternatives based on sustainable development principles was developed during preparation of the EIS. A number of alternatives, ranging from "no development" to a comprehensive ski resort and village, were generated; and natural, social and economic data were integrated in the analysis of alternatives. An independent panel was appointed to hear submissions on all alternatives and to recommend the best solution to government. The case study reinforced two key premises. First, it underscored the value of undertaking a strategic assessment that incorporated a wide range of alternatives, and integrated technical, environmental, social and economic information in the EIS and decision-making process. Second, it demonstrates that environmental dispute resolution can be achieved through a focus on the requirements of distributive, procedural, and relational justice. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Inc.

DE environmentalism; science policy; ecological modernisation; national
   styles
AB Throughout Europe, science and technology policy within the environmental field is currently in a process of transformation, which has been characterised by many observers as ecological modernisation. Emphasis is being given to preventive principles and so-called cleaner technologies in the quest for a more sustainable development. Each European country has, however, adapted the new doctrines and practices in distinctive ways. The main aim of the paper is to show how contemporary policies have been shaped by history, more specifically, by institutional and cognitive traditions, and by national policy styles. By comparing 'ecological modernisation' in Sweden and Denmark, we attempt to indicate how such national cultural differences affect the ways in which science and technology policies in the environmental field are formulated and implemented.

AB Research on more productive and sustainable sugarcane production systems would be aided by a comprehensive simulator of the sugarcane crop that is cognisant of a broader crop-soil-management system. A sugarcane crop model is described that can be deployed in the APSIM framework for agricultural systems simulation. The model operates on a daily time step, grows a leaf canopy, uses intercepted radiation to produce assimilate, and partitions this assimilate into leaf, structural stalk and sugar. The crop physiological processes represented in the model respond to the radiation and temperature environment and are sensitive to water and nitrogen supply. The model simulates growth, water use, N accumulation, sugar dry weight and fresh cane yield for plant and ratoon crops in response to climate, soil, management and genotypic factors. The model was developed on 35 datasets from Australia, Hawaii, South Africa and Swaziland, covering a wide range of crop classes, latitudes, water regimes and nitrogen supply conditions. Coefficients of determination for model predictions compared to observed data included 0.79 for LAI, 0.93 for crop biomass, 0.83 for stalk sucrose and 0.86 for N accumulation in above ground tissues. The particular strengths of this model are discussed in the context of agricultural systems simulation. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

DE research cooperative; silvicultural systems; old-growth forests
AB The Montane Alternative Silvicultural Systems (MASS) study was established on Vancouver Island, B.C. to develop operationally feasible and ecologically sustainable silvicultural systems in old-growth forests. The project addresses regeneration, biodiversity and aesthetic concerns over clearcutting at high elevations. Over twenty integrated studies are examining the biological and economic consequences of shelterwood, small patch clearcut, dispersed green tree retention and clearcut alternatives. Planning and preharvest studies began two years before the 1993 harvesting. The Forest Engineering Research Institute of Canada (FERIC) documented the cost and feasibility of harvesting. Post-harvest studies have been underway for five years with funding by the Canada-B.C. Forest Resource Development Agreement (FRDA II), Forest Renewal BC (FRBC), Industry Canada and project cooperators. There are numerous challenges associated with establishing and managing a multi-disciplinary, long-term research site with multiple partners. This paper discusses the administrative aspects of integrated research based on our experience with the MASS project.

AB The Canadian Forest Service (CFS) has organized a National Forest Ecosystem Research Network of Sites (FERNS). These sites are focussed on the study of sustainable forest management practices and ecosystem processes at the stand level. Network objectives are to promote this research nationally and internationally, provide linkages among sites, preserve the long-term research investments already made on these sites and provide a forum for information exchange and data sharing. The 17 individual sites are representative of six ecozones across Canada and address the common issue of silvicultural solutions to problems of sustainable forest management. While the CFS coordinates and promotes FERNS, the network consists of local autonomous partners nationwide who benefit from the FERNS affiliation through increased publicity for their sites.

AB The performance of mountain forests is expected to be wide and varied. Apart from making the important resource wood available on a sustainable basis, this also involves socio-cultural benefits, dealt with in this paper under the headings conservation, recreation, health effects and ecological impacts. While the demands for these benefits are constantly growing in many mountain regions, market-oriented pressures are making the fulfilment of these demands increasingly difficult and unsatisfactory. Socio-cultural benefits are still expected by users to be provided as a matter of course "in the wake of" wood production. There is a serious lack of proper valuation of these benefits, the main cause for the widening gap between user demands and the ability to meet them.

AB The sustainable use of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) is often put forward as a means for ensuring the conservation of forest vegetation types. This paper presents the results of research carried out in the savanna zone of Benin, which highlights the fact that the majority of species yielding important NTFPs are, in fact, located in the fields and fallows. The paper describes how the presence of villages affects the distribution of different vegetation types and how farmers selectively retain certain NTFP tree species, thereby creating a characteristic parkland landscape. It is suggested, however, that changes in the agricultural system and a gradual decline in the importance of NTFPs in people's lives will reduce the incentive for maintaining NTFP species and lead to the eventual loss of the parklands.

TI From spare change to real change - The social sector as beta site for
   business innovation
SO HARVARD BUSINESS REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
AB Corporations are continually looking for new sources of innovation. Today several leading companies-are beginning to find inspiration in:an unexpected place: the social sector. That includes public schools, welfare-to-work programs, and the inner city.
   Indeed, a new paradigm for-innovation is emerging: a partnership between private enterprise and public: interest that produces profitable and,sustainable change for both sides.
   In this article, the author shows how some companies are moving beyond corporate social responsibility to corporate social innovation. Traditionally, companies viewed the social sector as a dumping ground for their spare cash, obsolete equipment, and tired executives. But that mind-set hardly created lasting change. Now companies are-viewing community needs as opportunities to develop ideas and demonstrate business technologies; find and serve new markets; and solve long-standing business problems. They focus on inventing sophisticated solutions through a hands-on approach. This is not charity; it:is R&D, a strategic business investment.
   The author concedes that it isn't easy to make the new paradigm:work. But she has found that successful private-public partnerships share six characteristics: a clear business agenda, strong partners committed to change, investment by both parties, rootedness in the user community, links-to other organizations, and a commitment to-sustain. and replicate the results.:Drawing on examples of successful companies such as IBM and Bell Atlantic,;the author illustrates how this paradigm has produced innovations that have both business and community payoffs.

TI Electric vehicle: A natural option for India?
SO IETE TECHNICAL REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
AB The paper is based on the findings of a study on the market potential of electric vehicle (EV) technologies in India, The study revealed that EV might be a more natural option right now in developing countries like India, than in developed countries, Given the warm climate, the current dire state of the environment In urban India, and the resource balance In India - the country has enough reserves of coal but not much oil - and the transportation needs and driving habits of its people (most of the personal transport vehicles are driven only twenty to forty kilometers a day), even a low-end EV technology appears to be economically viable and appropriate. This is established in the paper through concrete evidence of data on all of the above factors. However, adequate awareness about appropriateness of EV for the Indian market is not there among the country's policy makers, researchers, and Industrialists. Indians traditionally look to the developed countries for automobile and other technologies, and since EV is not yet considered viable in most of the developed countries because of their vastly different driving habits and automobile culture, Indian decision makers erroneously take it for granted that EV is not viable for them either. It may be noted that more than 70% of personal transport vehicles In India are two wheelers with extremely polluting two-stroke engines. It is time now for policy makers, researchers, and industrialists of the country to change their mind set and explore the EV option seriously. Specific suggestions have been made In the paper on how this can be done and how India may be supported in these efforts by multilateral and bilateral aid agencies. These agencies can facilitate active technology cooperation between developed and developing countries, and help India develop and market appropriate electric vehicles, particularly electric two-wheelers. The India Government should also be encouraged to develop appropriate policies that would hasten the development and creation of viable EV markets. India may thus lead the world toward a path of sustainable development.

ID MATHEMATICAL-ANALYSIS
AB Aspects of anaerobic and aerobic energy conversion are investigated using a mathematical model of running in conjunction with world-record statistics. Analysis of the data shows that over distances from 1500 to 10,000 m the anaerobic energy utilised is constant and independent of running distance. This result is consistent with the view that the full potential of the anaerobic capacity is available for conversion during extended periods of running; the opinions of Gollnick and Hermansen (1973) and Peronnet and Thibault (1989) that the anaerobic energy contribution declines with race duration are not corroborated. The analysis supports the finding of Peronnet and Thibault(1989) that, for running times below about T = 420 s, the maximum sustainable aerobic power is constant, and that for larger T it then declines progressively. The present analysis shows it falls by some 4.5% over 10,000 m, T approximate to 1600 s, indicating that in establishing current world records at 5000 and 10,000 m athletes did not rely solely on glycogen as the source of aerobic metabolism; limited use was made of free fatty acids. For elite male runners, the anaerobic capacity and maximal aerobic power are evaluated as 1570 J/kg and 27.1 W/kg, respectively. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID RIVER WATER-QUALITY; VALUATION
AB The importance of integrating environmental considerations into economic analyses has been widely recognized. Indeed, the UK Government has made a commitment to evaluating environmental costs and benefits in investment appraisal techniques in both UK Sustainable Development Strategy and the duties of the Environment Agency. However, an evaluation framework is required to provide comprehensive and consistent environmental benefit assessments. In the aquatic environment, techniques based on cost benefit analysis and environmental economics have been developed, but these may not incorporate the full range of factors which determine anthropogenic use. This study considers the application of a broadly-based marketing approach, by translating key marketing concepts to an aquatic environment context, and incorporating assessment techniques from both the physical and management sciences. An assessment approach emerges which includes fundamental demand and supply side considerations in environmental valuation and investment appraisal. The further development and application of this approach offers the prospect of targeting investment on the aquatic environment more effectively. (C) 1999 Academic Press.

   ATLANTIC ZONE; SOIL DRIVEN; LAND-USE; TROPICS; EVOLUTION
AB Emissions of nitrogen (N) oxide were simulated for one current, unsustainable pasture management system (Natural) and two alternative, sustainable systems (Grass-Legume and Fertilized Improved ed) relevant to the Northern Atlantic Zone (NAZ) of Costa Rica, To produce frequency distributions of N oxide emissions, an expert system for generating technical coefficients of pastures nas linked with a process-based simulation model. The expert model generated parameter sets representing different options for the three management systems. The simulation model was rerun for each parameter set. Simulated nitrous oxide (N2O)-N losses 25 yr after pasture establishment were 3 to 5 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) for natural pastures, 12 to 15 for grass-legume mixtures, and 7 to 28 for fertilized grasses, Losses of nitric oxide (NO)-N were 1 to 2 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) for natural pastures, 7 to 8 for grass-legume mixtures, and 3 to Ib for fertilized grasses. Stepwise multiple regression showed that N2O-N losses were explained by annual C input to the soil (R-2 = 0.997), and NO-N losses by attainable dry matter production (R-2 = 0.972), Carbon input and dry matter production were controlled by stocking rate and fertilizer level. Soil-atmosphere N oxide emissions from pastures may increase by a factor 3 to 5 when natural pastures are converted to improved pastures, Such conversion may increase the sustainability of the pasture by stopping the decline of soil N, However, the change is not necessarily sustainable from a global perspective because it increases the emission of N oxide greenhouse gases.

AB Triclosan is a nonionic, broad-spectrum, antimicrobial agent that has been incorporated into a variety of personal hygiene products, including hand soaps, deodorants, shower gels, mouthwashes, and toothpastes. In this study, plastic containing 1,500 ppm of triclosan was evaluated in plate overlay assays and meat experiments as a means of reducing populations of bacteria. Plate overlay assays indicated that the triclosan-incorporated plastic (TIP) inhibited the following organisms: Brochothrix thermosphacta ATCC 11509, Salmonella Typhimurium ATCC 14028, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 12598, Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6051, Shigella flexneri ATCC 12022, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, and several strains of E. coli O157:H7. In meat experiment 1, irradiated, lean beef surfaces inoculated with B. thermosphacta, Salmonella Typhimurium, E. coli O157:H7, or B. subtilis were covered with TIP, vacuum packaged, and stored for 24 h at 4 degrees C. Of the organisms tested, only populations of B. thermosphacta were slightly reduced. In meat experiment 2, prerigor beef surfaces were inoculated with E. coli O157:H7, Salmonella Typhimurium, or B. thermosphacta incubated at 4 degrees C for 24 h, wrapped in TIP or control plastic, vacuum packaged, and stored at 4 degrees C for up to 14 days. There was a slight reduction in the population of the organisms after initial application with TIP. However, bacterial populations following long-term, refrigerated (4 degrees C), vacuum-packaged storage up to 14 days were not statistically (P less than or equal to 0.05) or numerically different than controls. In meat experiment 3, even TIP-wrapped, vacuum-packaged beef samples that were temperature abused at 12 degrees C did not exhibit significant (P less than or equal to 0.05) or sustainable reductions after 14 days of 4 degrees C storage. Another study indicated that populations of E. coli O157:H7 or B. thermosphacta added directly to TIP were not affected after 2 h of refrigerated storage or that the antimicrobial activity could be extracted from the plastic. Additional experiments suggest that presence of fatty acids or adipose may diminish the antimicrobial activity of TIP on meat surfaces. This study demonstrates that while antimicrobial activity is detected against bacterial cultures in antimicrobial plate assays, plastic containing 1,500 ppm of triclosan does not effectively reduce bacterial populations on refrigerated, vacuum-packaged meat surfaces.

AB The Northwest Forestry Association, whose mission is to ensure favorable operating environment and a reliable timber:supply: for the forest industry in Oregon and Washington, sees flaws in the Committee of Scientists' report. In its own efforts to promote sustainable management of the region's forests, the association has found that the current plans, based on multiple use as required by law, adequately protect the sustainability of the resource. The committee's call for "ecological sustainability" to become the new mission of the Forest Service is therefore unwarranted. Ar the very least, the report should have been peer reviewed.

It offers an innovative; science-based approach for protecting structures, processes, and conditions to sustain wildlife and ecosystems. The panel missed opportunities to address protection of roadless areas and to call for clear implementation standards. The major challenges ahead are for the Forest Service to produce clear standards for ecosystem integrity and species viability and to establish objective methods of determining whether the standards ave being met.

ID WATER INTERFACE MOTION; GROUNDWATER-MANAGEMENT; SALTWATER INTRUSION;
   OPTIMIZATION MODEL; SIMULATION
AB A number of nonlinear optimization-based multiple-objective management models for sustainable utilization of coastal aquifers are formulated and solved. The management objectives represent plausible scenarios for planned withdrawal and salinity control in coastal aquifers. The first multiple-objective management model is developed for spatial and temporal control of aquifer salinity through planned pumping (withdrawal) from locations closest to the ocean boundary. The second multiple-objective management model is useful for maximizing sustainable water withdrawal from the aquifer for beneficial uses, while limiting the maximum salinity in the aquifer. The third multiple-objective management model is developed for maximizing sustainable water withdrawal from the aquifer for beneficial uses and minimizing the total pumping at locations adjacent to the ocean boundary to control the salinity in the aquifer. The nonlinear finite-difference form of the steady-state density-dependent miscible flow and salt transport model for seawater intrusion in coastal aquifers is embedded within the constraints of the management model. The constraint method of generating noninferior solutions is used to solve the multiple-objective management problems. The management models are solved for a hypothetical unconfined coastal aquifer system. The projected augmented Lagrangian method of nonlinear programming is used to solve the resulting large-scale optimization problem. The solution results demonstrate the feasibility of the developed optimization models and also the conflicting nature of the various objectives of coastal aquifer management.

TI Russia: Systemic transformation or federal collapse?
SO JOURNAL OF PEACE RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB Most scholars have argued that the Russian Federation, having survived the turbulence of 1992-93, has slowly developed a durable and sustainable modus operandi. This article argues for the opposite. It notes that the constituent parts of the federation gradually secured greater constitutional and political legitimacy throughout Yeltsin's second-term presidency, even to the extent of regionalizing some federal military structures. They entered into economic alliances with newly privatized companies, created independent communication and information networks and, to a more limited extent, developed foreign economic policies. Although this drift towards growing regional autonomy was kept more or less in check by the centre's ability to contain the wilder excesses of regional governors, the 1998 'August Meltdown' disrupted the balance between centripetal and centrifugal forces within the federation by dramatically weakening the centre's power. As a consequence, the federal system of governance is disintegrating not by design but by default. Following an analysis of the extent to which federal transformation has occurred during 1998, the article charts the likely future trajectory of this process. It argues that as the centre is largely unable to combat the crisis, Russia will either become a very weak federation dominated by large regional blocs, or a confederation. The article concludes by suggesting char Russia's systemic transformation will affect our perceptions of security within the region and that this has important implications for Western policymakers.

DE Giraffa camelopardalis; giraffe; home range; long distance movements;
   Niger; spatial behaviour; sustainable management
AB The last population of giraffes in west Africa lives in Niger in an unprotected Sahelian region inhabited by farmers and herders. The spatial behaviour of each individual of the population (n = 63) was studied by direct observation during 15 mo. Two-thirds of the population were resident in the tiger bush in the rainy season and in the nearby area of Harikanassou, a sandy agricultural region, in the dry season. Rainy season and dry season home ranges were mutually exclusive and individual home ranges were overlapping when considering one season (rainy season: 84%; dry season: 67%). The mean size of the seasonal home ranges of these resident giraffes during the dry season (90.7 km(2)) was twice the mean size during the rainy season (46.6 km(2)). A third of the population moved 80 to 200 km in three directions, and two giraffes from an isolated group from Mall moved 300 km along the Niger River. Long distance movements of such length have never been reported before, and several explanations are proposed: previous distribution, social transmission, hydrographic network and food availability, poaching events. The giraffes in Niger do not avoid rural communities; indeed, they live in densely populated regions. Furthermore, their movements, synchronized with human activities in these regions, are representative of life conditions in the Sahel.

AB Immunological protection of mammalian hosts against tick infestation has been proposed as the most sustainable alternative tick control method to the current use of acaricides which has several limitations. The success of this method is dependent on the identification of key molecules for use as tick vaccine antigens. Proteolytic enzymes are involved in a wide range of cellular processes in eukaryotes such as development regulation and nutrition, thus they can be considered as good target antigens for a tick vaccine. In the present study we used primers designed based on the consensus amino acid motifs flanking the conserved active sites C-25 and N-175 present in all papain-like cysteine proteinases to amplify by polymerase chain reaction, sequence and characterize two Haemaphysalis longicornis tick cysteine proteinase genes. Based on the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences, both genes were identified as members of the cysteine proteinase gene family by presence in their sequences of consensus motifs flanking the conserved active sites C-25, H-150 and N-175 that are present in all papain-like cysteine proteinases. Both genes are about 1.2 kb in size and show high sequence homology predominantly to invertebrate cathepsin L-like cysteine proteinases.

ID OVERLAPPING GENERATIONS MODEL; GROWTH; PRESERVATION; EQUILIBRIA; EQUITY
AB Recent papers have examined sustainability in overlapping generations models with a nonrenewable resource or a renewable resource with a fixed rate of regeneration. When the regeneration of the resource depends upon the resource stock, a competitive economy can generate a variety of outcomes, from resource exhaustion to inefficient overaccumulation, depending upon the value of key parameters. Output shares, private discount factor, intergenerational transfers, and labor supply when old affect the steady-state equilibrium and therefore the implied social rate of time preference. In some cases, a nondecreasing utility requirement can be Pareto inefficient. (JEL Q20).

AB Purpose: The purposes of this study were to estimate noninvasively the maximal lactate steady state (MLSS) in trained cyclists on a windload simulator with a velocity based technique and to determine whether the HR at MLSS (HRMLSS) elicited a similar blood lactate concentration (BLC) during field testing. Methods: To determine and verify MLSS, 10 male cyclists performed five to seven laboratory trials on separate days, including a (V) over dot O-2max test; a 5-km time trial (TT); and two or more 30-min trials at specific percentages of each subject's average 5-km TT speed (AVS(5km)). Mean +/- SD for the following variables were obtained at MLSS: velocity was 90.3 +/- 2.7% of the AVS(5km), BLC was 5.4 +/- 1.6 mM, RPE was 15 +/- 2.1, (V) over dot O-2 was 80 +/- 6.3% of (V) over dot O-2max, and HR was 167 +/- 9.5 beats.min(-1), which was 88 +/- 3.8% of the mean maximum HR. Field tests included three laps of an 8-km road circuit at HRMLSS +/- 3 beats.min(-1) and one lap at maximum sustainable velocity (a road TT). Results: There were no significant differences in BLC, HR, and RPE between the three steady-state road laps and the lab MLSS trial. There was also good agreement between the road and lab MLSS velocity/TT velocity ratios. Conclusions: Our data suggest that 5-km TT cycling velocity, as measured on a windload simulator, may be used to estimate MLSS and the IIR at MLSS for training purposes.

TI Design principles from traditional mountain irrigation systems (bisses)
   in the Valais, Switzerland
SO MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID WATER
AB The bisses are a traditional mountain irrigation system constructed in response to periodic water deficit during the summer months in the Valais canton of Switzerland. The origins of the bisse system can be traced back to the 11th century AD, but may be as old as the Iron Age. The system expanded rapidly in the fifteenth century because of economic incentives to intensify meadow production. The design principles, governance, and organization and water management strategies changed little from this period up to the end of the 19(th) century, despite periods of demographic and climatic change. Since this time the bisse system has been modernized and rationalized in line with wider structural changes to the economy and technological advancement. This paper describes some of the fundamental changes to design principles which have occurred to the bisse system during the 20(th) century and assesses the likely impacts these may have on the long term sustainability of bisses. These findings are then discussed in relation to other mountain irrigation systems. The wider relevance of these findings to irrigation planners of the future is also discussed.

TI Tree management in the northwestern Andean Cordillera of Peru
SO MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

ID VALUATION; PRODUCTS; FORESTS
AB Peasant communities in the northwestern Andean Cordillera of Peru utilize an effective tree management strategy which helps to satisfy their principal needs. Trees provide many material goods for the peasants, including wood for home and furniture construction, glue, cords, medicines, soap, and poison. However, weakness of the communal organization means that control of access to forest areas is inadequate, resulting in over-exploitation of forest resources, over-grazing, and soil erosion. An inventory of the major arboreal and shrubbery species in the area was compiled to provide a base for more sustainable management, as well as for better planning of future reforestation in the region. Priority was given to description of each species in terms of its local use, applicability for agroforestry, and position in the soil and landscape context in which it has developed. The genera Acacia, Alnus, Cordia, Erythrina, and Prosopis are proposed as the most effective for improvement of those forest areas that are used for grazing.

ID NONSTERILE SOIL; STERILE
AB Among tropical environments, Cerrados stand out because of its agriculture potencial. Although microorganisms play an important role on soil sustainability and crop production, few information is available on the effects of soil management systems on Cerrado's microbial ecology. In this study the effects of environmental conditions and soil management practices on bacterial populations were evaluated. Bacterial population densities in soil under native vegetation were variable and diferentiated. Actinomycetes densities varied from 1.7 to 50 x 10(4) CFU/g dry soil in Sete Lagoas region, Brazil, whereas bacterial populations in both the first and second year of land use were similar and higher than those from soil under native vegetation in the Planaltina region. Soil management practices did not cause strong modifications in the equilibrium among actinomycetes populations obtained from both spores and hyphal. The spore/hypha ratios varied from 1.1 to 5.8. Correlation coefficients among actinomycetes and other bacteria populations were significant in soybeans rhizospheres. Results show that soil management practices used for soybean cultivation in Cerrado soils may influence the equilibrium of bacterial populations.

DE developing countries; meat; livestock systems; globalization
AB Developing countries have very diverse food consumption patterns and agricultural production systems. The proportion of meat in national diets varies from negligible in some countries in central Africa to 30-40% in some countries in Latin America and Mongolia. However, the demand for meat in developing countries is increasing rapidly (53 %/year from 1982 to 1993), as the result of population growth and the trend for people to move to the cities. Growth rates in consumption are greatest in Asia, with China dominating the statistics, in view of the size of its population. Theoretically, livestock production can be increased to meet this demand, but the multiple roles of livestock in developing countries must be recognized if this is to be achieved in a sustainable manner. Resource-poor farmers who keep livestock may value more highly their contribution to livelihoods and to crop production, through provision of draught power and improvements in soil fertility through the recycling of manure, than the production of more meat. Recognition of the goals of the farmer and the wishes of the consumer regarding meat quality need to be reflected in the way in which opportunities for increasing meat production are identified and communicated to farmers. The impact of the global economy on cereal prices, for example, will also influence which interventions will be economically viable. Interpretation of information in an integral manner, using geographical information systems, mathematical models and/or simple spreadsheet models will be an important ingredient in turning scientific knowledge into increased meat production in developing countries.

AB The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has developed a process of assessing, designing, purchasing, installing and operating photovoltaic systems which meet the remote power needs. This process has been developed under a collaborative partnership, with the Photovoltaic Systems Assistance Center (PVSAC) at Sandia National Laboratories. The purpose of this partnership is to establish the sustainable use of photovoltaic technology in the agency through increased familiarization and acceptance by employees and the public. Under the partnership, a total of 65 projects have been completed. The keys to successful projects discussed here include: an advocate of the project and users who believe it meets their needs, standardized systems purchased with standard specifications as 'ready-to-install' kits, and involving the local maintenance staff and users during the installation, The systems resulting fi om this implementation process are performing extremely well.

AB Impacts of nuclear weapons testing and concerns about climate change have encouraged Pacific Island countries (PICs) to support international norms of environmental protection and sustainability. This has been facilitated by regional intergovernmental mechanisms assisting modest national diplomatic capabilities. Yet the processes needed to effect national environmental protection strategies remain partial and incomplete. A divergence has developed between the international obligations undertaken and actual national implementation. The article investigates this gap and how it might be rectified. Challenges include better integration of environmental management within economic decision making, and harnessing limited social and organizational capability to achieve goals of environmental sustainability. Although some convergence between domestic practice and international rules and norms of environmental sustainability is evident, PIC administrators face conflicting pressures when attempting to accomplish this task. Convergence is needed for PICs to accumulate standing as sovereign actors seen as discharging the international obligations that they accept. Policy frameworks emerging from international rule formulation offer practical ideas for small island state environmental management. Philosophies of rule prescription and compliance, emerging through embryonic international governance, also offer scope for emulation within PIC domestic settings.

TI Restructuring non-metropolitan local government in South Africa
SO PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB South Africa's first local government elections held in November 1995 and June 1996 cemented the transition from apartheid to democratic local government. The focus at that time was on the deracialization and democratization of local governance, which was successfully achieved. Local government since then, however, has failed to fulfil its mandate as the delivery arm of government, nor has the hoped-for rapid transformation of the local sphere of government materialized. In seeking an explanation for this perceived inadequacy, attention has tended to focus on the limited financial and administrative capacity of newly elected councillors and council staff. Although the lack of capacity does present a barrier to the achievement of effective local government, the constraints municipalities encounter in their geographic composition and administrative formation provide the structural dimension of municipal constraint. The White Paper on Local Government published in March 1998 seeks to address these structural constraints and, through an ambitious legislative process, chart a path to 'developmental' local government. This article identifies the constraints experienced by nonmetropolitan municipalities and analyses the likely impact of the government's restructuring programme for the achievement of viable and sustainable local government in South Africa.

TI Pricing the limits to growth from minerals depletion
SO QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper evaluates the loss of global welfare from exhaustion of nonrenewable resources, such as oil. The underlying methodology represents an empirical application of some recent developments in the theory of green accounting and sustainability. The paper estimates that the world loses the equivalent of about 1 percent of final consumption per year from finiteness of the earth's resources, compared with a counterfactual trajectory where global extraction of minerals is allowed to remain forever constant at today's flow rates and extraction costs.

TI Strategic managerial incentive compensation in Japan: Relative
   performance evaluation and product market collusion
SO REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS
LA English
DT Article
ID MORAL HAZARD; CONTRACTS; TOURNAMENTS; INFORMATION; EXECUTIVES; PAY
AB In an oligopolistic product market, shareholders strategically use information on rival firms' performances when designing management-incentive contracts. When shareholders use industry performance information through relative performances evaluation (RPE), they evaluate their manager's effort more easily, but hinder collusive behavior in the product market. However, when compensation is positively linked to the industry performance through strategic group performance evaluation (SGPE), the credibility of a manager's commitment to product market collusion increases, and the sustainability of a collusive outcome increases. I test how industry performance affects management-incentive compensation using the data from 796 Japanese firms during the period 1968 to 1992. The results show that management compensation is positively linked to industry profit, suggesting the use of SGPE in management-incentive compensation. Cross-sectional analysis shows that the positive effect of industry profit on management compensation is higher in competitive industries than in concentrated industries. The positive effect is greater in slow-growing industries than in fast-growing industries. Empirical tests incorporating the risk component method show the same results. These results are consistent with the argument that, in a growing market or in a concentrated market, the value of SGPE diminishes as the value of commitment to collusion diminishes.

AB The present work discusses the problems of atmospheric pollution of three Megacities of Latin America (Mexico City, Sao Paulo and Santiago). The environmental pollution control programs implemented by the Government are revised and the evolution of pollution levels during the period of 1988-1995 at Santiago de Chile and Sao Paulo, but until 1997 at Mexico City, in order to evaluate the impact of these programs. During this period, a decreasing trend is observed in the three cities in the levels of PTS, PM10, SO2, NO2, CO and O-3, although most of these contaminants still exceed the air quality standards. It must be emphasized that the largest impact has been on the levels of SO2. We recommend the development of sustainable transport policies; in this context, various strategies were proposed by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in the European Conference of Ministers of Transport. Additionally, public participation is important when decisions are taken on transport policies.

AB Few articles have been published that specifically deal with how to support strategic analysis and management in small-medium sized enterprises (SMEs). In the last decade, however, literature on strategic management has paid considerable attention to the resource-based theory, which seems to fit well the needs of owners and executives of SMEs. The objective of this article is twofold: (i) to present a resource-based view of an SME's sustainable competitive advantage; (ii) to propose an approach to strategy analysis based on such a view.

AB Microbial biomass and enzyme activities are affected by management practices and can be used as sensitive indicators of ecological stability. Microbial biomass C (MBC), microbial biomass N (MBN) and eight enzyme activities involved in the cycling of C, N, P and S were studied in the surface (0-5 cm) of an Irwin silty clay loam soil (fine, mixed, mesic, Pachic Arguistoll) in a tallgrass prairie ecosystem. Treatments of annual spring burning and N fertilization were initiated in 1986 and encompassed: (1) unburned-unfertilized, (2) burned-unfertilized, (3) burned-fertilized, and (3) unburned-fertilized, Activities of dehydrogenase, beta-glucosidase, urease, deaminase, denitrifying enzyme, acid phosphatase, alkaline phosphatase, and arylsulfatase were assayed. Long-term burning and N fertilization of the tallgrass prairie soil reduced MBC and MBN relative to the unburned-unfertilized treatment. The effects of burning and N fertilization varied among the enzymes and the time of sampling. Long-term burning significantly (P < 0.05) increased activities of urease and acid phosphatase, but decreased activities of beta-glucosidase, deaminase and alkaline phosphatase. Long-term N fertilization significantly increased activities of beta-glucosidase and acid phosphatase but decreased urease activity. This study found that several soil enzyme activities can be used as indicators of ecological changes caused by N fertilization and long-term burning management practices. The relevance of these changes in surface soil to the long-term sustainability of this ecosystem needs further evaluation. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We used natural C-13 abundance in soils to calculate the fate of C-4-C inputs in fields cropped to continuous corn (Zea mays L.). Soil samples were collected from eight cultivated and six adjacent, noncultivated sites: of the Corn Belt region of the central USA, The amount of organic C in cultivated soils declined an average of 68%, compared with adjacent, noncultivated sites. The delta C-13 Of cultivated soil profiles that had been under continuous corn for 8 to 35 yr increased in all depth increments above that of the noncultivated profiles. The percentage of soil organic C (SOC) derived from corn residues and roots ranged from 22 to 40% of the total C. The proportion of corn-derived C, as determined by this technique, decreased with soil depth and was minimal iri the 50- to 100-cm depth increments of fine-fextured soils. The mean residence time of the non-corn C (C-3) ranged from 36 to 108 yr at the surface, and np to 769 yr at the subsoil depth, The longer turnover times were associated with soils high in clay. Prairie-derived soils have a higher potential to sequester C than those derived from forests. The significant loss of total C at all sites and the slow turnover times of the incorporated C lead us to conclude that there is a substantial potential for soils to serve as a C sink and as a significant nutrient reserve in sustainable agriculture.

AB Sustainability of agricultural management systems has become an issue of wide public concern and international debate. One result is that soil quality assessment has been suggested as a tool for evaluating sustainability of soil and crop management practices. Our objective was to adapt a soil quality index to assess the effects of three long-term tillage systems on sloping Grantsburg silt loam soil. Soil quality was evaluated using a framework that included three soil functions: (1) resist erosion (water relations), (2) provide plant nutrients (nutrient relations), and (3) provide a favorable root environment (rooting relations). A score for each of these functions was computed using measurements (indicators) that were normalized with one of the three (more is better, optimum, or worse) scoring functions. Six different indices were developed from a basic framework. Modifications included changing the weighting factors, threshold limits, or type of scoring function applied to indicators, and the addition of air-filled and water storage porosity to the nutrient and rooting relations functions. Changing threshold limits and the type of scoring function used for surface residue improved the correlation between water relations and soil lass. The addition of porosity indicators increased the sensitivity of nutrient and rooting relations functions to yield and cone index, respectively, and resulted in a better correlation between porosity indicators and plant population. Computing soil quality indices helped to combine different soil properties and processes into a simple tool that explained changes in complex soil properties in response to different tillage practices. This supports previous studies suggesting that computing soil quality indices and functions could be useful for selecting management practices to maintain or improve soil quality. Our results demonstrated that adjusting threshold limits for local conditions can make the function ratings more or less sensitive to thr management practices being evaluated.

AB An exploration of traditional perspectives and contemporary propositions regarding sustainable competitive advantage points to the conclusion that the locus of advantage is located specifically within organizational effects. The key issue emerges that research investigating sources of sustainable competitive advantage must be done not only on organizations but also in organizations. The fallout from this conclusion is, however, that the research methodologies traditionally used in strategy research will not unambiguously uncover these sources of sustainable advantage. Using organizational culture as an example of a possible source of sustainable advantage within a resource-based paradigm, a four-step research framework is suggested for isolating these organizational effects.

AB The paper argues that, in contemporary market economies, most production is debt financed. In order to pay off these debts, there is a necessity for economic growth that results in enormous waste of human effort and a misuse of the earth's resources. The Douglas-Orage Social Credit analysis, which attracted world-wide attention during the 1920s and 1930s, concluded that the pressure for economic growth, induced by the role of finance, led inevitably to economic and military rivalry between nations, and to long run environmental degradation, because short run maximization decisions squander non-sustainable resources, whilst ignoring the 'third party' social benefits and costs that arise out of the process of exchange. The Draft Mining Scheme put forward by Douglas and Orage in 1920 sought to avoid these difficulties by devolving responsibility for finance to industrially based local producers' banks. Such a financial system could create a framework under which ecological sustainability becomes economically viable. Economic developments over the decades since the Douglas-Orage texts were published have emphasized the need to remove the dominant role of finance in determining economic and industrial policy.

AB Traditionally most investors have sought only financial returns from their investments. The idea of reaping environmental benefits from investment is not widely accepted, primarily because ecology and economy have Long been considered mutually exclusive by financial markets. However, as social values change growing numbers of investors are beginning to identify the potential role of investment in assisting moves towards ecologically sustainable development (ESD). With a focus on the sizeable Australian investment market, examples are drawn from overseas of recent research and environmentally screened investment funds providing evidence of a positive correlation between environmental and financial performance. The implications of the deregulation of the investment market in Australia and the importance of corporate environmental reporting (CER) and other methods of communicating environmental performance to investors, both individual and institutional(1), are discussed. The paper concludes that while the trade-off between ecology and economy remains within the dominant paradigm, and despite a lack of widespread CER, changes in investment patterns are occurring. As this gathers momentum, aided by more transparent corporate environmental behaviour both environmental and financial returns can be achieved.

ID EPISTEMIC COMMUNITIES; COOPERATION
AB The Resource Management Act, the cornerstone of New Zealand's legislated environmental policy, reflects the mediation of internationally debated constructs of sustainable development and profoundly local meanings of living within nature. The outcome is a made-in-New Zealand approach to conceptualizing sustainable management in national environmental policy. This paper demonstrates how and why the contribution of non-New Zealanders and the first peoples of New Zealand, the Maori, to this conceptualization differ so profoundly from each other. External influences, such as the thinking of the World Commission on Environment and Development (WCED) on defining sustainable development, have the greatest impact in the initial conceptualization of policy formulation. It is through Kingdon's (1984) policy stream, rather than through his other two streams of politics and problems, that outside views weigh in most convincingly. First peoples are positioned to be influential in policy formulation through all three of Kingdon's streams because of their appreciation of locality and long-term commitment to place. These factors are reflective of a philosophy and ideology which is not the bedrock of state legislation about sustainable management. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the relationship between economic growth and environmental degradation and begins by reviewing the largely theoretical discussions from the 'limits to growth' debate of the 1970s to the advent of sustainable development in the 1980s. The paper then examines the recent studies that have subjected the growth - environment relationship to a statistical analysis through the estimation of environmental Kuznets curves (EKCs). The extent to which these studies indicate a decoupling of environmental damage from growth is considered and reasons are suggested why some environmental indicators appear to improve with growth whilst others deteriorate. In order to illustrate the need to interpret EKCs carefully, forecasts of global emissions are made, for the period 1990-2020, for two pollutants that EKCs suggest are being decoupled from economic growth. Policy implications are then discussed. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

AB The Gambia has one of the fastest-growing populations in Africa; the growth is most pronounced in the Greater Banjul Area (GBA), its largest metropolitan area. The GBA will probably accommodate an additional half million people between 1996 and 2006, almost trebling its population during the period. Such a population growth will make great demands on infrastructural resources. The challenges facing land use planners are immense, and this paper argues a need to pursue long-term sustainable policies to ensure more effective investment in physical infrastructures, offer cheap transport and safeguard areas of environmental and agricultural importance.

AB Civil aviation has become a major industry and is one of the fastest growing sectors of the world economy. The growth of civil aviation has advantages and disadvantages for the society. The advantages include the direct and indirect generation of new jobs within and around the sector as well as providing a strong stimulus to the globalisation of the industry, business and long distance tourism; Disadvantages include its negative impacts on the environment. This paper presents an overview of the impacts of civil aviation on the environment. In particular, it considers some of the important technological and institutional innovations, that have been implemented in the sector over time in order to simultaneously increase its efficiency and decrease the negative impacts on the environment. Thus, it illustrates how a 'sustainable' development of the sector is attempted to be achieved through management of the system's noise, air pollution and safety side effects.

AB Recent reviews have demonstrated that a substantial proportion of cases of malaria are managed in the private sector, and international policy initiatives routinely emphasize the need for malaria control programmes to collaborate with the private sector. However, information on how to develop successful partnerships: between the public and private sectors remains limited. This paper reviews the current knowledge about the management of malaria by private providers, considers the potential of different strategies for influencing the quality of cart: provided, and identifies processes for facilitating public-private sector collaborations. We contend that public sector-led interventions, such as training of private providers or the distribution of prepackaged antimalarials through the private sector, are unlikely to scale up to sustainable national level programmes if they do not take into account a wide range of needs and concerns, represented by private provider organizations and other interest groups, including service users. These groups should be involved at kev stages including the design and piloting of interventions, through to the dissemination and implementation of findings. Research priorities are outlined for the development of tools to facilitate public-private partnerships for improving the management of malaria.

AB Whereas reductive dechlorination of tetrachloroethene (PCE) and trichloroethene to ethene (ETH) has been demonstrated, some laboratory and field studies indicate that partial dechlorination is often observed. Because partial dechlorination may produce compounds of equal or greater toxicity than starting compounds, it is important to identify factors that are responsible for complete dechlorination. A comparative study was completed to examine ethene production from a PCE-fed culture and a vinyl chloride (VC)-fed culture. Physiochemical conditions, nutrients and the electron donor (methanol) were identical for both cultures. PCE-fed cultures were able to sustain an ETH production rate of about 0.1 mu mol d(-1) whereas ETH production by a VC-fed culture declined to about 0.02 mu mol d(-1) over 115 d. PCE additions to the VC-fed culture improved ETH production. Results suggest that VC dechlorination to ETH may not be sustainable in the absence of a higher chlorinated ethene. This could mean that for sites capable of partial reductive dechlorination (via natural bioattenuation or stimulated bioattenuation), differential retardation of higher chlorinated ethenes may result in a contaminant plume with VC at the leading edge. In such cases, the degree of VC dechlorination under anaerobic conditions may decline with time. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Genuine savings rates in developing countries
SO WORLD BANK ECONOMIC REVIEW

ID GAS; GREEN; OIL; SUSTAINABILITY
AB Augmented measures of savings and wealth in the national accounts are critical to conceptualizing and achieving sustainable development. After developing the theory of genuine savings-traditional net savings less the value of resource depletion and environmental degradation plus the value of investment in human capital-this article presents empirical estimates for developing countries. These calculations account for resource depletion and carbon dioxide emissions, using consistent time series data for 1970-93. The empirical evidence shows that levels of genuine savings are negative in a wide range of countries, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa, and that these countries are being progressively impoverished Increasing the coverage of natural resources and pollutants in our calculations would reduce the estimated levels of genuine savings overall. The use of genuine savings measures suggests a series of policy questions that are key to sustaining development. These are also explored, specifically the extent to which monetary and fiscal policies, exports of exhaustible resources, stronger resource policies, and pollution abatement measures boost genuine savings rates. For policymakers, linking sustainable development to genuine savings rates means that there are many possible interventions to increase sustainability, from the macroeconomic to the purely environmental.

AB Marine bioprocess engineers face a unique challenge for the millennium: designing methods for the sustainable development of known marine resources, as well as inventing a new generation of tools and processes that will enable a greater understanding of the ocean and its resources and lead to the discovery of new bioproducts for the future. The identification and application of novel, marine-derived pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, nutritional supplements, enzymes, and pigments have already been realized. The current and potential market value of these marine bioproducts is substantial. Continued discovery and development of marine resources will depend on a number of factors: identification of new bioproducts, sustainable use of the product, optimization of production, and efficient product recovery. Successfully addressing these challenges will require the integration and collaboration of multidisciplinary teams of oceanographers, biologists, chemists, and engineers.

AB The effect of light-path length (i.e, reactor width or thickness) of flat plate glass reactors on outdoor production of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and cell mass of Nannochloropsis sp. was tested, using a range of light-paths from 1.3 to 17.0 cm. Volumetric productivity of cell mass and optimal, as well as maximal cell density which represents the highest sustainable cell density under the experimental conditions, decreased with increase in light-path. Daily areal output rate (g dry weight m(-2) day(-1)) increased with increased light-path, in contrast with results obtained in similar reactors with Spirulina cultures, in which areal output rates increased when the light-path was reduced. Maximal areal productivity of Nannochloropsis sp. (12.8 and 22.4 g ash-free dry weight per day per m(2) of irradiated reactor surfaces, in winter and summer, respectively), reflecting maximal efficiency in light utilization, was obtained with the long light-paths, i.e. 10.4 and 17.0 cm. Increasing the light-path from 1.3 to 17.0 cm resulted in an increase in areal EPA productivity, from 66.7 to 278.2 mg m(-2) day(-1) in winter and from 232.1 to 515.7 mg m(-2) day(-1) in summer. This enhancement in areal productivity of EPA stems from increased productivity of cell mass which was associated with the increase in light-path. We concluded that the optimal light-path, which must be defined for each algal species, represents an important parameter which determines optimal culture density (i.e. resulting in the highest output rate of cell mass per irradiated reactor surface), as well as productivity of cell mass and cell products. Under our conditions the optimal light-path for culturing Nannochloropsis in vertical reactors was ca 10 cm. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

SO LANCET

ID GAMBIAN VILLAGE; MUSCA-DOMESTICA; TRANSMISSION; IMPACT
AB Background Domestic flies are accepted vectors of diarrhoea, but their role in trachoma transmission has never been quantified and no study has shown that fly control decreases the prevalence of trachoma. We assessed the effect of fly control on public health in a pilot study in Gambian villages.
   Methods We studied two pairs of villages-one pair in the 1997 wet season, and one pair in the 1998 dry season. For each pair, deltamethrin was sprayed for 3 months to control flies in one village whilst the other was used as a control. Fly populations were monitored with traps. We surveyed trachoma at baseline and at 3 months, and collected daily data on diarrhoea in children aged between 3 months and 5 years.
   Findings Fly control decreased numbers of muscid flies by around 75% in the intervention villages compared with controls. Trachoma prevalence was similar at baseline (wet season, prevalence in intervention village 8.8% vs control 12.2%; dry season, 18.0% vs 16.0%), but after 3 months of fly control there were 75% fewer new cases of trachoma in the intervention villages (wet season 3.7% vs 13.7%; dry season 10.0% vs 18.9%; rate ratio and relative risk of pooled data 0.25 [adjusted 95% CI 0.09-0.64], p=0.003). There was 22% less childhood diarrhoea in the wet season (14% vs 19%, period prevalence ratio 0.78 [0.64-0.95], p=0.01), and 26% less diarrhoea in the dry season (6% vs 8%; 0.74 [0.34-1.59], p=0.60) compared with controls.
   Interpretation Muscid flies are important vectors of trachoma and childhood diarrhoea in The Gambia. Deltamethrin spray is effective for fly control and may be useful for reducing trachoma and diarrhoea in some situations, but further research on sustainable fly-control methods is needed.

AB In approaching the new millennium, industry is forced to recognise it has an obligation to society not only to create wealth but to develop sustainable production systems which minimise environmental consequences. Such objectives can only be achieved if there is the political will backed up by a coordinated K&D policy in clean and sustainable technologies. Three underlying questions need to be addressed:
   what does industry need to do to address sustainable production?
   who are the key players involved and what must they do to ensure that sustainable production is achieved?
   how do government policy and regulation need to evolve in order to support the shift to sustainable production? (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Spin configurations along the thickness direction generated in antiferromagnetic (AF) layers with an in-plane uniaxial anisotropy have been calculated by numerical method. It is confirmed that when the bottom-surface anisotropy energy constant is less than 1/4 of 180 degrees-wall energy density, sigma(w), a sudden change or switch of the spin configuration occurs at a critical angle of the top spins when the AF-layer thickness, t, is greater than a critical value, t(c). This means that no hysteresis occurs with a rotation of the top spin for t<t(c). Spin configurations with a folded or periodic structure which Neel discussed have been revealed to be unstable without microscopic defects or irregularities which pin the spin angle at some depth from the top surface. It is found that when the bottom-surface anisotropy is lower than 1/4 sigma(w), the torque sustainable by the top-surface spins does not exceed 1/2 sigma(w). It is also found that the effect of top-spin rotation penetrates substantially down as deeply as a few times the 180 degrees-wall thickness. The effect of the AF-easy axis tilting out of the plane has also been studied. (C) 1999 American Institute of Physics. [S0021-8979(99)64208-6].

AB The potential implications of harvesting fig (Ficus) trees for timber in the tropical forests of eastern Bolivia was assessed through density estimates of mature fig tree species and fig tree regeneration, together with the density and phenology of tree species that provide important alternative food for frugivorous wildlife. Terrestrial ('free-standing') and hemi-epiphytic ('strangler') tig tree densities varied among four forests sampled (gallery, dry, sub-humid, and floodplain forests) from 0-3.3 to 1.6-67 trees/ha, respectively However, only the sub-humid forest had significant densities of well-formed free-standing figs suitable for harvesting, out of which only 26% of the total density of mature free-standing figs were of commercial grade quality. Because of the scarcity of well-formed fig trees, the elimination of Fig tree populations from these forests by overharvesting is unlikely. However, the elimination of well-formed individuals of species by over-harvesting is possible. Fig seedling and sapling density was low in all forest types, but was highest in areas with increased light and soil disturbance. Thus, while harvesting may reduce the density of mature fig trees available for wildlife, it may also create improved conditions for regeneration. Also, wildlife use of figs was not measured here, figs appear to play an important role in sustaining wildlife in these forests because of the scarcity of other tree species with fleshy fruits in all forest types at the end of the rainy season (April-May). While this study suggests that harvesting rates are not high enough to seriously jeopardize food availability for wildlife, it will be important to more closely define permissible harvesting levels for fig tree species that do not significantly impact frugivorous wildlife species.

TI Innovations for competitiveness: European views on
   "better-faster-cheaper"
SO ACTA ASTRONAUTICA
LA English
DT Article
AB The paper elaborates on "lessons learned" from two recent ESA workshops, one focussing on the role of Innovation in the competitiveness of the space sector and the second on technology and engineering aspects conducive to better, faster and cheaper space programmes. The paper focuses primarily on four major aspects, namely:
   a) the adaptations of industrial and public oganisations to the global market needs;
   b) the understanding of the bottleneck factors limiting competitiveness;
   c) the trends toward new system architectures and new engineering and production methods;
   d) the understanding of the role of new technology in the future applications.
   Under the pressure of market forces and the influence of many global and regional players, applications of space systems and technology are becoming more and more competitive. It is well recognised that without major effort for innovation in industrial practices, organisations, R&D, marketing and financial approaches the European space sector will stagnate and loose its competence as well as its competitiveness. It is also recognised that a programme run according to the "better, faster, cheaper" philosophy relies on much closer integration of system design, development and verification, and draws heavily on a robust and comprehensive programme of technology development, which must run in parallel and off-line with respect to flight programmes.
   A company's innovation capabilities will determine its future competitive advantage tin time, cost, performance or value) and overall growth potential. Innovation must be a process that can be counted on to provide repetitive, sustainable, long-term performance improvements. As such, it needs not depend on great breakthroughs in technology and concepts (which are accidental and rare). Rather, it could be based on bold evolution through the establishment of know-how, application of best practices, process effectiveness and high standards, performance measurement, and attention to customers and professional marketing. Having a technological lead allows industry to gain a competitive advantage in performance, cost and opportunities. instrumental to better competitiveness is an R&D effort based on the adaptation of high technology products, capable of capturing new users, increasing production, decreasing the cost and delivery time and integrating high level of intelligence, information and autonomy. New systems will have to take in to account from the start what types of technologies are being developed or are already available in other areas outside space, and design their system accordingly. The future challenge for "faster, better, cheaper" appears to concern primarily "cost-effective", performant autonomous spacecraft, "cost-effective", reliable launching means and intelligent data fusion technologies and robust software serving mass-market real time services, distributed via EHF bands and Internet.
   In conclusion, it can be noticed that in the past few years new approaches have considerably enlarged the wavs in which space missions can be implemented. They ale supported by true innovations in mission concepts, system architecture, development and technologies, in particular for the development of initiatives based on multi-mission mini-satellites platforms for communication and Earth observation missions. There are also definite limits to cost cutting (such as lowering heads counts and increasing efficiency), and therefore the strategic perspective must be shifted from the present emphasis on cost-driven enhancement to revenue-driven improvements for growth. And since the product life-cycle is continuously shortening, competitiveness is linked very strongly with the capability to generate new technology products which enhance cost/benefit performance.

AB Three apple pest-management regimes are being compared for their ecological impacts, and their ability to ensure the economic production of high-quality apples. Species diversity, pest status and fruit quality are being evaluated under: (i) conventional, (ii) integrated, and (iii) biological fruit production systems. The conventional system follows current export orchard practices with broad-spectrum pesticides, and the integrated system uses a wider range of control methods, including minimal spray applications, preferably of selective pesticides. The biological system uses mating disruption for codling moth (at one site), Bacillus thuringiensis for leafrollers, copper/slaked lime for diseases, and matting or mulches for weed control.
   Conventional production results in few insects being present during the season and Little damage at harvest, but increasing insecticide resistance problems and changing market requirements put the sustainability of this system in doubt. In the integrated system, excellent control of Lepidoptera has been achieved using tebufenozide, with little effect on natural enemies. Further development of the system is needed, but the economics appear favourable for producing export-quality fruit in future. In the biological system, the lack of effective controls for key quarantine pests limits economic sustainability and largely restricts production to the local market. The future of this system for export production depends on innovative technology to overcome these problems. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The sustainability of natural grasslands is in large part dependent upon the successful ingress and propagation of alien plant species. We attempted to characterize the propagation potential of the dominant plant species of a southeastern Montana mixed-grass prairie community including two introduced grasses, Bromus japonicus and B. tectorum. Aboveground standing crops and densities of seeds were estimated on 10 dates between September 1991 and August 1993 and seedling densities were estimated on 21 dates between September 1991 and July 1993. Total aboveground standing crop ranged from about 110 to 340 g m(-2) and was dominated by three grasses: Bouteloua gracilis, a warm-season, perennial; Pascopyrum smithii, a fool-season, perennial; and B. japonicus, a cool-season, annual grass. Seed production was dominated by B. japonicus (similar to 10,400 seeds m(-2)). Bouteloua gracilis and P. smithii seed production was negligible with maximum densities of about 120 and 25 seeds m(-2), respectively. Density of seedlings was greatest for B. japonicus (similar to 2100 seedlings m(-2)), Festuca octoflora (similar to 1100 seedlings m(-2)), and Plantago patagonica (similar to 350 seedlings m(-2)). Maximum number of B. gracilis seedlings was 25 m(-2). No P. smithii seedlings were observed during the study. Temporal differences in seedling densities were closely tied to late summer-early fall precipitation patterns. Although community-level seed production and seedling establishment processes were dominated by B. japonicus, the overwhelming presence of herbage produced by the two vegetative propagating species, B. gracilis and P. smithii, casts doubt on a trend in ecological succession toward an annual grass-dominated community.

   BIOINDICATORS
AB Five sandy loam soils under organic, integrated and conventional management were chosen to investigate the effect of specific agricultural management practices on suppression of brown foot rot of cereals caused by Fusarium culmorum. The relationships between suppressiveness and C and N content of the soil microbial biomass and microbial activity were investigated. Fungistasis tests and plant bioassays were compared. Differences in suppressiveness were most marked in plant bioassays following seed inoculation with F. culmorum. When inoculum was applied to soil as conidia or mycelia, soil-suppressed transmission of the pathogen and disease development. This finding indicates that the competitive saprophytic ability of the isolate of F, culmorum is poor. The microbial biomass and activity of the soils under organic and integrated farming were high. However, high biomass and activity were not always correlated with high disease suppression. Specific organic amendments, such as mulching with straw and the practice of using lucerne as a break-crop in cereal cultivation may influence inoculum potential of F. culmorum, disease outbreak and suppression. The possible significance of soil abiotic factors on disease suppression is discussed. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB During a two-year held study, an annual nutrient budget and cycles were developed for a small agricultural watershed. The study emphasized the integrated unit of the watershed in understanding the biogeochemistry. It was found that the total nutrient input was 39.1 x 10(4) kg nitrogen and 3.91 x 10(4) kg phosphorus in the year 1995, of which the greatest input of nutrients to the watershed was chemical fertilizer application, reaching 34.7 x 10(4) kg (676 kg/ha) nitrogen and 3.88 x 10(4) kg (76 kg/ha) phosphorus. The total nutrient output from the watershed was 13.55 x 10(4) kg nitrogen and 0.40 x 10(4) kg phosphorus, while the largest output of nitrogen was denitrification, accounting for 44.1% of N output; the largest output of phosphorus was sale of crops, accounting for 99.4% of P output. The results show that the nutrient input is larger than output, demonstrating that there is nutrient surplus within the watershed, a surplus which may become a potential source of nonpoint pollution to area waters.
   The research showed that both denitrification and volatilization of nitrogen are key ways of nitrogen loss from the watershed. This suggests that careful management of fertilizer application will be important for the sustainable development of agriculture. The research demonstrated that a multipond system within the watershed had high retention rate for both water and nutrients, benefiting the water, nutrient and sediment recycling in the terrestrial ecosystem and helping to reduce a,agricultural nonpoint pollution at its source. Therefore, this unique watershed system should be recommended due to its great potential relevance for sustainable agricultural development.

AB During the annual dry season, illegal hunting of black and spectacled caiman in the Mamiraua Sustainable Development Reserve in western Brazilian Amazon is widespread. Hunting occurs throughout the reserve, but is particularly intense in the northern Panaua region, where it provides the primary source of income for local residents during the dry season. While hunting prior to 1970 was principally to obtain caiman skins for sale, hunting today is entirely for the sale of caiman meat. People in the region do not eat the meat themselves, but after salting sell it to buyers who mix it with fish and in turn sell it in Part state, Brazil, and in Colombia. preliminary information suggests that the annual harvest is approximately 115 metric tons of fresh caiman meat, which would represent a harvest of 5230 black caiman and 2865 spectacled caiman. Despite this illegal hunting, the population of black caiman has one of the highest reported densities for Amazonia. The impact of hunting on wild populations may be reduced because the hunters take mostly adult and subadult males, from relatively accessible parts of the reserve. Hunting in the Mamiraua reserve illustrates that a sustained harvest of caiman populations may be possible under the right conditions. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Amounts of fungal biomass in adjacent cultivated and uncultivated soils in central Iowa were estimated and compared try quantifying soil ergosterol concentrations and lengths of fungal hyphae present. Both indices of fungal biomass, with one exception, indicated that there was at least twice as much fungal biomass in uncultivated soil as in cultivated soil. Levels of microbial biomass carbon in uncultivated soils were also determined to be at least twice that in cultivated soils. Data collected in this study indicate that fungi may be more significantly affected by agricultural soil management practices than other components of the soil microbial community. For two of the soils examined, calculated estimates denote that fungal biomass carbon represented approximately 20% of the total microbial biomass carbon in cultivated soil and about 33% of the microbial biomass carbon in uncultivated soil. Results of this study indicate that conventional agricultural practices result, in a significant reduction of fungal biomass production in soil. Implications of differences in fungal biomass between the soils are discussed.

AB The annual area burned on an 8.6 x 10(6) ha study area in the boreal mixedwood forest of northeastern Alberta, Canada, was characterised as a serially independent random draw from a lognormal distribution. This characterisation was applied in Monte Carlo simulations, which showed that estimates of the mean annual burn rates, even with long sample periods, are highly imprecise;Monte Carlo simulation was also used to simulate the development of a forest subject to lognormally distributed annual burn rate in an attempt to characterise the equilibrium age-class structure. No equilibrium age-class structure could be identified from the simulation results. The validity of equilibrium age-class distribution models (e.g., the negative exponential and Weibull) and analysis that relies on these models is questioned for forests where the annual burn rate is highly variable.

AB Conservation biologists and natural resource managers are both working to maintain species, but their approaches and priorities differ. The contrast was highlighted when the World Conservation Union (IUCN) listed some commercial fish species, such as the Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), in the 1996 Red List of Threatened Animals. These species qualified under IUCN's criteria because they had undergone a marked decline in abundance. Disagreements over these listings revealed fundamental differences between resource managers and conservation biologists. Resource managers aiming to maximize continuing yields using specific, explicit, and data-rich models, generally have not considered risk assessment and sometimes face the necessity for political compromises. Conservation biologists generally consider a wide diversity of species and operate in a data-poor and precautionary context with an overall aim of minimizing extinction risk. The IUCN Red List is an extreme case in point and uses simple criteria for evaluating the conservation status of all species. Under these circumstances, it can do little more than indicate a species' status in order to prompt further investigation by the appropriate body. We suggest that procedure collaboration between conservation biologists and resource managers will start with an understanding of these different perspectives and will benefit from common interests in precautionary approaches, ecosystem approaches, and adaptive management studies.

AB The Dja Biosphere Reserve, a lowland rainforest in southern Cameroon, supports extensive biotic communities with a high proportion of endemic fauna and flora. A growing human population afflicted by an economic crisis and a predilection for game meat has augmented pressures on the faunal resources. We conducted a 2-year study to assess the spatial distribution and intensity of hunting in the western Dja Reserve and the implications for the management of these activities. We mapped the area where the villagers hunt, determined snare densities, and collected biological data on species killed. Surveys using standard line-transect methodology were conducted on mammalian game species in the various hunting zones across strata of human-disturbed and less-disturbed areas. In the three hunting zones of the village of Mekas, snare density decreased as distance from the village increased. Despite a 64% lower snare density, the monthly overall capture rate was four times higher there than in the zone closest to the village. The number of animals that rotted on snares was three times higher in the farthest hunting region from the village. Except for the four common arboreal primates, encounter rates and densities of game species tended to decrease with proximity to human activity and with an increase in snare densities. Duikers (Cephalophus spp.) comprised 63.5% of animals killed. We used Robinson and Redford's (1991) production model to determine the sustainability of the present harvest rates. Harvest rates of C. monticola, C. dorsalis, and C. callipygus in two of the hunting zones were between one and three times higher than the populations can theoretically sustain. As species are depleted, hunters will journey even further into the forest to hunt. To reduce waste, subsistence hunting should be limited to within 15 km of the village. Ecological studies to determine stochastic and deterministic influences on the duiker populations are required to ensure their conservation within the Dja Reserve.

TI Economic incentives for management of Venezuelan caiman
SO CONSERVATION BIOLOGY

ID SPECTACLED CAIMAN; LLANOS; CROCODILUS
AB In Venezuela, the harvest of spectacled caiman (Caiman crocodilus) hers generated significant economic benefits for citizens and the government wildlife department. Between 1983 and 1995 more than I million caiman were harvested with an export value in excess of $US 115 million. Although limited survey data restrict quantitative comparisons most indications suggest that the harvest has been within sustainable limits. Hunting is conducted on private lands in the central Venezuelan plains where caiman populations benefit from cattle ranching management activities, particularly, the construction of dry-season water holes. For ranchers, caiman hunting produces a high return on investment, but the overall earnings are small when compared to those produced by cattle. Caiman are mostly a quick and easy source of income that complements cattle ranching, and there is little incentive to actively manage caiman populntions. The only evidence that the income from caiman harvests generates economic incentives to protect caiman populations is that landowners sold the skins of caiman illegally hunted in other areas, so ns not to reduce their own caiman populntions and possibly diminish future hunting quotas. There is no evidence that caiman harvesting generates economic incentives to protect natural habitat, because caiman benefit from human alteration of savanna habitats associated with the much more economically important cattle ranching activities. Recent changes in how hunting quotas are assigned have reduced economic incentives for landowners to protect caiman populations, but the changes have made the quota-setting procedure simpler: One of the greatest conservation benefits of the program has been its ability to generate operating funds for the traditionally cash-strapped government wildlife agency through a variety of taxes and user fees. Due to a recent government restructuring, however, program proceeds will now go to the central treasury and will no longer benefit wildlife management programs.

AB The search for frameworks and indicators of sustainable development has taken a prominent place in this journal. However, some specific aspects have received little or no attention, notably the spatial dimension and the role of international trade in indicator development. Moreover, many sustainable development indicators comprise implicit valuations, weighting schemes and policy objectives, which are insufficiently recognised as such. This contribution tries to highlight these issues by means of a review of a recently proposed indicator for ecological-economic analysis, namely the ecological footprint, that has been developed by Wackernagel and Rees. Its concept and calculation procedure are criticised on a number of points, and it is concluded that the Ecological Footprint is not the comprehensive and transparent planning tool as is often assumed. In explaining our position we will argue that spatial sustainability and regional sustainable development have not been precisely discussed so far, neither in the literature on trade and environment, nor in that on sustainable development. We will defend the view that trade can contribute positively and negatively to environmental unsustainability. Consequently, indicators and models are needed that allow for analysing interactions and trade-offs between such opposite effects. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

ID SUSTAINABILITY
AB This paper applies the concept of natural capital stock, and identifies its critical elements, in a regional sustainable development context in order to assess its conceptual and practical relevance. Assessment of the physical stock of natural capital was undertaken for Central Region in Scotland. It was found that the concept can be a useful way of assessing, and giving greater recognition to natural resources at a regional or local level. However, identification of critical levels of resources was less straightforward. The lack of clear guidelines relating to criteria of criticality, natural capital category aggregation issues, and conflicts between types of critical natural capital were encountered as major issues. The application of an absolute preservation rule was found to suffer from the same general disadvantages as any absolute rule. Nevertheless, the assessment of natural capital and identification, where possible, of critical elements were thought to be a useful adjunct to sustainable development work.

ID QUALITY
AB Economywide reforms often contribute simultaneously to economic, social and environmental gains. However, Unintended adverse side effects occur in many cases-when such growth inducing reforms are undertaken while neglecting other policy, market or institutional imperfections. The remedy does not generally require reversal of the original economywide reforms, but rather the ex-ante implementation of additional complementary measures that remove such imperfections. The EKC approach seeks to relate the state of the environment to the stage of development. Developing countries could learn from the experiences of industrialized nations, and restructure growth and development to 'tunnel' through any potential EKC-thereby avoiding going through the same stages of growth that involve relatively high (and even irreversible) levels of environmental harm. An environmentally adjusted measure of national income could significantly change the shape of the development-environment relationship. Recommendations for decision-making include: actively seeking 'win-win' policies that simultaneously yield both economic and environmental gains; pre-empting environmental harm through ex-ante remedial measures; and fine-tuning reform policies to avoid severe environmental damage. The adoption of more sustainable policies will facilitate the attainment of higher levels of development at a lower environmental cost. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The paper introduces four scenarios for sustainable economic structures in the Netherlands for 2030. The aim of this paper is to provide possible answers to what a sustainable future might look like in terms of alternative economic structures. To this end, an empirical economy-ecology model is developed and calibrated to four different scenarios indicating different development paths and different perspectives on sustainability. In the first scenario, called Strong Together, environmental goals are very ambitions world-wide. In the second scenario, Strong Alone, environmental policy abroad is less ambitious. The third scenario, Negotiated Sustainability, broadly reflects a balancing of different goals. In the fourth and last scenario, Weak Sustainability, only low cost environmental measures are taken and environmental objectives are relatively loose. The applied economic model with environmental modules optimises economic growth subject to different environmental objectives that are in line with the different scenarios and perspectives on sustainability. It appears that both strong (environmental) technological progress and substantial structural changes are necessary for economic growth and environmental quality to be compatible. However, some trade-off between them remains. Some sectors lose market share in all scenarios, including most energy-intensive and agricultural sectors. On the other hand, 'winners' are dependent on the level of the critical environmental objective(s) and hence differ between the scenarios. Explicit attention is paid to the so-called 'ecological trade balance', which measures the (environmental) balance between the domestic production structure and the domestic consumption structure. Embarking on sustainable economic structures implies that the Netherlands 'shifts' environmental pressure abroad. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

   Philippines; sustainability; throughput
AB Statisticians avoid getting involved in data analysis, leaving data users on their own in interpreting the results of their work. This is particularly unfortunate in a new area of applied statistics such as environmental accounting with which few are really familiar. Earlier this year data producers and users explored, in a national seminar, possible policy applications of the results of a 'green accounting' project in the Philippines. The main findings of the author's contribution to the seminar, on which the present paper is based, are that environmental accounts: (1) present evidence of sustainable economic performance in the country during the relatively short-time period of 1988-1994; (2) provide information for environmental cost internalization; (3) may guide investment to environmentally sound production processes; (4) help to specify and monitor policies of natural wealth conservation, distribution and management; and (5) reveal major data gaps. The paper concludes that environmental accounts help to assess the sustainability of economic growth in terms of broadly defined capital maintenance. The sustainability of development, however, would have to be measured by alternative or supplementary physical indicators linked to quantifiable standards or targets. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB The study aimed to compare the rate of vehicle and pedestrian track development between an unprotected open area and a protected one during the last 50 years. The results indicate that: (1) the rate of change in the length of tracks per 1 square kilometer of a site has been four times greater in the unprotected area than in the protected area; (2) the number of area cells (the areas between the tracks) increased geometrically in the unprotected area, while the increase in the protected area was linear; and (3) most area cells (50%-70%) in the protected area in each of the years analyzed (except 1944) were smaller than 10 ha in size. However, an area cell greater than 100 ha has always been observed. In contrast, in the unprotected site the number of area cells increased with time while their area size decreased. Twenty-Seven percent of the unprotected area is composed at present of area cells smaller in size than 1 ha. The development of a track system in the protected site changed moderately with a few peaks during the past 50 years. This trend is a result of land management policies that actively promote sustainable ecotourism. However, in the unprotected open area, the track system has changed continuously and drastically due to a lack of land conservation management.

AB The application of the modern biotechnology to food, notably through the use of GM, has raised concern amongst the European public. Values that underlie this public concern about food biotechnology, include perceptions of: trust, choice, need, and carl for a sustainable society and natural balance. Recommendations are advocated for addressing these social aspects, in terms of improving consumer choice, promoting greater public involvement in decision making and achieving a sustainable society. A model of risk analysis for genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and genetically modified food that incorporates this social dimension, through the integration of risk analysis with a social impact analysis is proposed, in order to build greater popular trust into the decision making processes.

DE Sudano-Sahelien area; plant parasitic nematodes; sustainability; fallow;

AB To study the influence of fallow on plant parasitic nematodes and soil fertility, the difference in the growth of millet in a greenhouse was compared in sterilized and naturally infested soil. These soils are ferruginous and were taken from a 17-year-old fallow plot and a neighbouring cultivated field, located in the region of Thysse Kaymor in Senegal. The plant-parasitic nematode community of the previously cultivated soil consisted primarily of two species: an ectoparasite, Tylenchorhynchus gladiolatus, and an endoparasite, Scutellonema cavenessi. The soil from the fallow plot was infested with many species, but under the influence of the millet crop, it evolved towards the two species situation observed in the cultivated soil, except that under the experimental conditions (in pots), Pratylenchus pseudopratensis replaced S. cavenessi. Whether or not the soil was infested with nematodes, the previous fallow period had a positive effect on the development of successive millet crops. The impoverishment of the soil through repeated cultivation and the impact of nematodes both reduced crop growth. The two factors evolved in the same way, that is a decrease in the development rate of the millet as the number of crop cycles increased. The symptoms of soil impoverishment can be corrected, either by suppressing the nematodes or by fallowing. (C) 2000 Editions scientifiques et medicales Elsevier SAS.

AB Input-responsive, high yielding rice varieties and associated technologies responsible for the doubling of yields on irrigated lands in Asia have not suited the area of more than 40 million hectares of Asian rainfed lowland rice. These environments are home to some of the poorest rural populations in South and Southeast Asia, and the rice crops are subject to drought, prolonged submergence From uncontrolled flooding and nutrient deficiencies. Farmers grow unimproved varieties and these, combined with abiotic stresses and low inputs, result in grain yields often less than 2 t ha(-1). The International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) and National Agricultural Research Systems (NARS) have recently joined to form the Rainfed Lowland Rice Research Consortium in order to identify: prioritize and execute strategic research that addresses critical yield and productivity constraints. Principal intervention points for achieving sustainable yield increases are in developing drought- and submergence-tolerant germplasm with good yield potential, improved nutrient management under stress conditions, water use-efficient crop establishment practices, and understandings farmers' approaches to risk management. Multidisciplinary reams of IRRI and NARS scientists execute research at sites selected across the region to represent the key sets of constraints.

AB Many farmers are intensifying production systems by applying greater amounts of inorganic fertilizers, irrigation and pesticides, especially to cash crops. Such intensified systems, even though economically profitable in the short run, may not be sustainable. This paper analyses the economics and sustainability of an intensified rainfed rice-based system in Ilocos Norte, Philippines. Farmers use high levels of inorganic fertilizers for cash crops such as sweet pepper, garlic and tomato. Although these crops generate high levels of income, the high input systems may not be sustainable in the long run due to adverse on-site and off-site effects. Preliminary estimates of total factor productivity that include on-site effects only, display no clear time trend. However, negative externalities created by high nitrate contamination of groundwater and high rates of pesticide usage could make the system unsustainable by adversely affecting human health and the environment.

AB Yield, input use, productivity and profitability of irrigated rice systems were analyzed based on surveys in Senegal (Thiagar and Guede), Mall (Office du Niger)and Burkina Faso (Kou Valley). The objective was to determine agronomic factors contributing to farmers' fertilizer-use efficiency and productivity, given current farmer practices. (A second paper addresses profitability and risk issues). Grain yields were highly variable, within and across sites. Minimum grain yield was 0.2 t ha(-1) (Thiagar), maximum recorded grain yield was 8.7 t ha(-1) (Office du Niger). The yield gap between actual farmers' yield and simulated potential or maximum attainable farmers' yield ranged from 0.6 to 5.7 t ha(-1) (Kou), 1.8 to 8.2 t ha(-1) (Thiagar), 0.3 to 6.3 t ha(-1) (Office du Niger), 0.8 to 5.7 t ha(-1) (Guede), indicating considerable scope for improved yield. Physiological nitrogen efficiency (delta grain yield/delta N uptake) was mostly between 40 and 80 kg grain kg(-1) plant N. Apparent recovery of fertilizer N was highly variable (average: 30-40% of applied N), Timing of N fertilizer application by farmers was extremely variable and often did not coincide with critical growth stages of the rice plant. Other agronomic constraints included: use of relatively old (>40 days) seedlings at transplanting (Kou, Office du Niger), P and/or K deficiency (Office du Niger), unreliable irrigation water supply (Kou, dry season), delayed start of the wet growing season resulting in yield losses of up to 20% due to cold-induced spikelet sterility (Kou, Guede, Office du Niger), weed problems (Thiagar), and late harvesting (Thiagar), Discussions during meetings with farmers at the survey sites revealed that farmers lacked knowledge on (i) optimal timing, dosage and mode of fertilizer application, (ii) optimal sowing dates to avoid yield loss due to cold- or heat-induced sterility, and (iii) the importance of N as the main limiting factor to yield. Possibilities to achieve a sustainable increase in rice productivity and profitability in West African irrigation systems are discussed. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB 1. Exercise capacity ultimately constrains behaviour, and therefore may influence social interactions. The hypothesis was tested that individual differences in maximal rates of oxygen consumption ((V) over dot(O2max))- a primary determinant of sustainable exercise capacity - affect dominance hierarchies in experimental all-female flocks of the highly social Red Jungle Fowl (Gallus gallus). It was also examined whether social rank could in rum influence (V) over dot(O2max) (which is quite plastic in most vertebrates), and whether these relationships were influenced by a common and relatively benign parasite, the intestinal nematode Ascaridia galli.
   2. Substantial between-individual variation was found in (V) over dot(O2max) that was significantly repeatable over time, but there was no indication that (V) over dot(O2max) was affected by A. galli infection. Stable social hierarchies were quickly established in 26 of 28 experimental flocks (each contained three females previously isolated from each other). Infection status affected social rank, but there was no consistent pattern between rank and infection.
   3. No indication was found that individual differences in (V) over dot(O2max) either predicted the social rank in newly formed flocks, or were affected by social status in established flocks.

AB Some people view the planet, as well as its present and future inhabitants, as a precious, interdependent system, and demonstrate this awareness in their daily activities and relation ships. While some of those people come to this realization gradually over a Lifetime, others can point to one or several significant and time-bounded experiences as the source of their commitment. It is this latter group, and their transformative learning experiences, that are the focus of this article based on a qualitative study of the transformative learning experiences of 14 men and women, mostly Canadians.

TI Synergetics and the images of future
SO FUTURES
LA English
DT Article
AB The hope of finding new methods of predicting the course of historical processes could be connected with the recent developments of the theory of self-organisation, also called synergetics. It provides us with knowledge of constructive principles of co-evolution of complex social systems, co-evolution of countries and geopolitical regions being at different stages of development, integration of the East and the West, the North and the South. Due to the growth of population on the Earth in blow-up regime, the general and local instability of development is increasing. The social world seems to go towards a unity, a sustainable commonwealth through pulsations rather than monotonously. It goes via alternation of disintegration, even if partial, and getting more powerful integrations of structures. There is a path of multiple reduction of temporal and material expenses, a path of a resonant excitation of desirable and-no less important-feasible in a given social system structure. In the case of the right topology of integration of geopolitical structures an arising whole organisation can accelerate its tempo of evolution. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Transcending oblivion
SO FUTURES
LA English
DT Article
AB This essay argues that a primary guiding vision for earth-life should be to emigrate from earth and this solar system prior to its oblivion by a dying Sun. While there is no urgency to accomplish this daunting task, there is cause for worry that today's behaviors may preclude earth-life from ever achieving this goal or, at the very least, delay achievement of the goal by many millions of years. Transcending oblivion is consistent with fundamental genetic imperatives for survival and psychological archetypes, myths, and motivations. Adopting this goal as an orientation for earth-life also overcomes several ethical problems associated with future generations and is consistent with environmental protection and sustainable development efforts. Transcending oblivion is not consistent, however, with other global trends towards ever increasing consumerism and individualism. It is suggested that new indicators be developed that measure progress towards transcending oblivion and risks to achieving the goal. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this article an alternative reading is presented to the 'heroic' Bristol version of John Cabot's voyage of discovery Cabot is viewed as a prototypical venture capitalist who inaugurated 500 years of resource exploitation in Newfoundland, as illustrated by, the record of Newfoundland's two lending industries:fishing and newsprint. This era culminated with the collapse and closure of the ground fishery, and fibre supply shortages in the newsprint industry. Further resource depletion was eventually halted by state intervention, and the imposition of strict regulatory practices. The discourse of sustainablity is put into question by this record wealth and political power derived from resource use, coupled with the difficulty of distinguishing between natural variations in resource yields and those due to depletion, have contributed to ineffective resource management. In direct consequence, irreparable damage has been done to the resource base.

ID LIFE-CYCLE INVENTORY; EUROPE
AB In the year 2040 we will have to feed 9-10 billion people and to provide them with energy and materials. We want them to live according to the requirements of a developed society, and we do not want to pollute the earth or change the climate. The question addressed in this contribution is whether this scenario-sustainable technological growth-is technologically possible on a world wide basis. In 1996, more than 80% of the world's energy demands (350 EJ a(-1)) originated from fossil resources (mineral oil, coal and gas) and the same holds for organic raw materials. In view of the exhaustion of fossil resources and environmental considerations, our radical hypothesis has been that we will no longer use fossil organic resources from, let's say, 2040 onwards.
   Our natural resources are the sun, CO2 in the atmosphere and land and water on the earth. It will be shown that these natural resources and the appropriate conversion technologies will enable us to move from the present fossil resources based economy to a plant-based economy as far as organic raw materials are concerned. The sun will be the major source of energy.
   The limiting factors in such a scenario are:
   1 the amount of agricultural land available;
   2 the ability of the world community to overcome the socio-economic and political problems in realising the scenario as formulated in the first paragraph of this abstract.
   It will be illustrated which technologies need to be developed further and fine-tuned in the coming decades. Examples will be given how present-day bulk organic chemicals and materials can be approached from biomass. Methanol is expected to develop as a key chemical (and hydrogen-carrier). Moreover, one may consider a partial substitution of materials of today by "green" materials, that are directly or in a few reaction steps available from biomass, such as starch and polylactate, respectively.
   One thing is certain: the plant will be the 'plant' of the future!

AB Pollution of the environment, especially groundwater, may be reduced by proper fertilizer management, based in part on crop removal. The weights and concentrations of nutrients in tissue components of cut-flower roses (Rosa hybrida L.) were determined to assist in developing a fertilizer management system that sustains a high level of production but also is environmentally friendly. Harvested flower stalks of the cv. Royalty were cut to 45-cm length, and sectioned into 15-cm units, from which blossom, leaf, and stem components were separated, weighed, and analyzed for nutrients. The flower represented 28.5%, leaves 46.0%, and stem 25.5% of the total weight of the stalk. Upper leaves had the highest levels (g . kg(-1)) of N (29.3), Ca (21.8), and Mg (3.0), and (mg . kg(-1)) Fe (74) and Mn (71). The flower was highest in K (18.4 g . kg(-1)), P (3.0 g . kg(-1)), Zn (29 mg . kg(-1)), and B (23 mg . kg(-1)). Annual removal of nutrients by 45-cm flower stalks totaled: 256.2, 187.5, 116.3, 30.0, 26.0, and 21.1 kg . ha(-1) of N, K, Ca, P, Mg, and S, respectively. Micronutrients removed per annum totaled 700, 470, 260, 200, and 190 g . ha(-1) of Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, and B, respectively. Assuming 50% recovery of applied N and 80% of K, a total annual application of N at 512 kg . ha(-1) and K at 234 kg . ha(-1) may replace the amounts removed. However, actual rates of N and K, as well as other nutrients applied, should be adjusted based on soil and tissue analysis results. Removal of nutrients will be greater if stalks harvested are >45 cm in length, which may necessitate additional nutrient application, depending on soil conditions.

AB Commercial research priorities target production cost reduction and expansion of new applications for established products to increase profitability. Cost effective seaweed production for phycocolloids relies on: (1) species and strain selection, (2) vegetative reproduction, (3) improvements in cultivation, harvesting and drying and storage. Increasingly, present linear technologies based on consumption of raw materials and production of product, and waste, will be replaced by cyclic technologies which maximize utilization of waste as raw material resources. Co-production and synergistic product development are not only green, but cost effective. Transportation of resources and products is energy expensive, but regional production promises to reduce transportation costs. Marine phycologists have important roles to play in the phycocolloid industry, especially in the development of co-generation and co-production technologies, in the domestication of seaweed cultivars to remove harvest pressure on target species and sensitive ecosystems, and in the development of regional low technology production.

AB Kappaphycus alvarezii (basionym Eucheuma alvarezii) was introduced to the Line Island atolls of Kiritimati (Christmas Is.) and Tabuaeran (Fanning Is.) in 1994 as an outer-island development programme in the Republic of Kiribati. Farming sites were selected, and commercial production commenced in September 1994. Production increased to 850 t y(-1) dry weight in two years, and by 1997 over 420 people were receiving income from seaweed. On Tabuaeran seaweed has now replaced copra as the main source of income for over 70% of all households. The new seaweed-based economy has also ensured the success of the resettlement policy of the Kiribati Government. Continuous monitoring of all suppliers has revealed net incomes for a family unit as high as AUS$ 4687 per annum from a farmed area of 900-1000 m(2). On Kiritimati, a small lagoon sand-flat of 6 hectares has been developed providing income for over 100 households producing 350 t y(-1). Women are not only actively involved in, but are frequently the main beneficiaries of, production. The Line Islands production has been significant in raising the total Kiribati harvest to over 1200 t y(-1) providing an important source of export earnings. The creation of a monopolistic industry and the implementation of a single-desk marketing strategy have made the development economically sustainable and competitive with S.E. Asia. The development represents a model for other isolated atoll communities in the Pacific Ocean where the economy is currently based on copra.

AB Most existing commercial video servers are designed for a single server. Consequently, the capacity of the system in terms of maximum sustainable concurrent sessions is limited by the performance of the video server hardware. This paper proposes and analyzes the performance of a novel parallel video server architecture where video data are striped across an array of autonomous servers. The architecture allows one to build incrementally scalable video servers without video data replication. The proposed concurrent-push scheduling algorithm allows the system to integrate with quality of service guarantees provided by today's switching networks. In this paper, the striping policy, the service model, and the concurrent-push scheduling algorithm are presented. A system model is constructed to quantify three performance metrics, namely, server buffer requirement, client buffer requirement, and system response time. Results show that a simple extension of the server-push service model does not perform well under the parallel video server architecture. To improve system performance, a novel extension of the grouped sweeping scheme called the asynchronous grouped sweeping scheme (AGSS) is introduced. To further increase the scalability of the architecture, a new subschedule striping scheme (SSS) is introduced. With the proposed AGSS and SSS, our parallel video server architecture can be scaled up to more than 10 000 concurrent users.

AB This article aims at making a dialectical assessment of the development of social welfare between the period of Mao's socialism and Deng's economic marketization. It examines the transformation of ideological discourses between the two periods and its impact on social welfare outcomes. It posits that an ideological system is important in affecting the outcome of social welfare policy. Mao's welfare policy, despite certain shortcomings, created a relatively equal, sustainable and self-sufficient society with solid achievements in social welfare and especially in human development. Deng's economic marketization, although remarkable in economic growth, is producing social contradictions leading to the decline of welfare service. The current development discourse is dismantling Mao's welfare policy without establishing a new and more democratic conception of socialist political economy.

SO INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
ID ECONOMIC-GROWTH
AB The concept of sustainable development was placed on the international agenda with the release of the report Our Common Future by the World Commission on Environment and Development in 1987. Although considerable attention has since been devoted to the idea of sustainable development itself, the broader conceptual framework of the idea-whereby the Commission tried to integrate environmental policies and development strategies in order to create the foundation for a global partnership-has been neglected in much of the literature. The purpose of the present article is to offer an interpretation of Our Common Future, where the concept of sustainable development is linked to the broader framework of normative preconditions and empirical assumptions. The structure of the argument is to demonstrate that the relationship between sustainable development and economic growth has been over-emphasized, and that other vital aspects of the normative framework have been neglected. Social justice (both within and between generations), humanistic solidarity, a concern for the world's poor, and respect for the ecological limits to global development, constitute other aspects of sustainable development; aspects which are indeed relevant for the growing disparity between North and South.

TI Problem-solving through international environmental agreements: The
   issue of regime effectiveness
SO INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
ID NEGOTIATIONS; POLITICS; LINKAGE; GOODS
AB Regime analysts tend to assume that for environmental agreements to be effective the environmental problem at stake must be relatively simple or "benign." This means, inter alia, that scientists should have reached consensus on causes and effects and that interests between and within countries are deemed to be not too conflicting. The implication of this assumption is, however, that international environmental regimes cannot effectively address more complex issues, such as the current global environmental issue of sustainability and climate change. This article outlines an alternative approach. Building upon a typology of policy problems developed in the policy sciences, it argues that, for addressing different kinds of environmental problems, we need different kinds of environmental regimes. It then goes on to develop a typology of environmental regimes which can deal with different types of environmental problems.

TI Economic instruments for environmental protection: Can we trust the
   "magic carpet?"
SO INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
ID POLICY
AB Economic instruments appear at first to be a promising alternative to regulations as instruments of environmental policy. Because they put market forces to work for the goal of a sustainable society, they are often portrayed as achieving goals at much lower costs. In this sense, economic instruments appear as a type of "magic carpet" for the trip to sustainable development. The article presents a "pre-flight check" of the carpet's viability, and finds several potential design problems. Economic instruments in practice often don't comply with the underlying economic theory. Further, the dominating notion of cost-effectiveness is only one of many criteria which policy-makers must taken into account in the real world. It is not a question of "good science" vs. "bad politics," but a recognition that politics has a rationality of its own. Thf lessons learned from analyses of policy-making and implementation deserve, therefore, equal attention with the presupposed behavioral reactions of key target groups. Issues to be taken into account include the interests of the actors involved, and the institutional contexts of both policy-making and policy-learning. Such factors are discussed by using them to shed light on observed deviations in instrument design.

AB Due to an enhanced global environmental awareness reinforced by dramatic environmental events, international conferences on the environment and development, as well as academic research and publications, have increasingly shifted the developmental discourse toward the concept of "sustainable development." In developing countries, however, the realization of the notion of sustainable development has come under challenge due to the emergence of neo-liberal regimes and their pro-market policies. The current article addresses the following issues in this context: the origin, meaning, and problems of sustainable development; the major features and policy orientations of neo-liberal regimes in developing countries; and the critical implications of neo-liberal policies for the environment and development. The article also offers some recommendations with a view to overcoming the contemporary challenges to sustainability and ensuring a more genuine and effective mode of sustainable development.

ID DEMOCRACY
AB There has been a remarkable evolution in environment-related policy-making at both national and international levels during the ten years since the Report of the Brundtland Commission formulated its well-known appeal for sustainable development. This article examines three developments in industrialized countries which appear to be closely associated with national efforts to engage with sustainable development: (1) the preparation of national environmental policy plans and strategies for sustainable development; (2) the growth of patterns of multi-partite environmental governance; and (3) the emergence of Sustainable Cities and Local Agenda 21 initiatives. It is argued that these phenomena, as well as a series of other important changes in approaches to the management of environmental burdens now occurring in contemporary societies, require serious attention from political scientists.

TI Hydrological and physical responses of a semi-arid sandy soil to tillage
SO JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ENGINEERING RESEARCH

ID ZIMBABWE
AB For sustainable crop production in semi-arid environments with low and erratic rainfall (<800 mm), runoff must be minimized and water conserved. However, little is known about how soils in semi-arid southern Africa respond to cultivation. This study investigated the hydrological and physical responses of a fersiallitic soil to conventional (flat) and improved (tied ridge) tillage practices over four seasons under natural and simulated rainfall conditions in Zimbabwe. Changes in soil surface roughness and the development of crusts were investigated and related to variation in the runoff ratio (total volume of runoff/total volume of rain). Relationships between runoff, rainfall intensity and antecedent precipitation index (API is an indicator of soil moisture content based on daily rainfall) were established for both systems. For the tied ridge system, API showed no significant contribution to runoff prediction. This reflects the greater and more stable depression storage capacity of the furrow in the tied ridge system. By comparison, the depression storage capacity of the flat system is temporary in nature and, as the micro relief of the soil surface weathers and crusts develop, its capacity declines, as does the time to pending and runoff generation.

AB 1. In minesoil reclamation, the establishment of a sustainable plant cover requires the improvement of limiting conditions and the re-initiation of carbon (C) and nutrient cycling.
   2. The approach used in this study for reclaiming an abandoned sandpit in Quebec, Canada, was based on a heavy organic amendment as an attempt to accelerate the reconstruction of a functional ecosystem,
   3. The one-time intervention consisted of incorporating paper de-inking sludge into soil at two rates (0 and 105 dry t ha(-1)), supplemented with nitrogen (N) at three rates (3, 6 and 9 g kg(-1) sludge) and phosphorus (P) at two rates (0 5 and 1.0 g kg(-1) sludge) followed by seeding (mid-summer) of Agropyron elongatum (Host) Beauv. (tall wheatgrass).
   4. Standing biomass increased in the presence of sludge after both the first and second full growing seasons. High N application rates further increased yield, more importantly in the second season. The high P rate improved grass establishment in all cases. Ground cover increased with time and doubled in the presence of sludge whereas it declined in the absence of sludge. Phosphorus and N uptake was improved consistently in the presence of sludge.
   5. Sludge application resulted in improved water retention and cation exchange capacities, and an increase in pH and bulk density of sandpit minesoil, all of which may have accounted for the significant improvement in plant responses. Levels of soil C and N suggest that this reconstructed system is approaching sustainability.
   6. Adequate N and P supplements will accentuate the positive influence of sludge on revegetation.

AB Gracilaria ferox J. Agardh was grown continuously in large, outdoor tanks under a pulse-fed nutrient regime for four years. Productivity ranged from 21.4 to 59.2 g d. wt m(-2) d(-1) with a mean of 39.7 g d. wt m(-2) d(-1) over the entire study period. Because the cultures were maintained under non-nutrient limiting conditions, productivity was regulated primarily by seasonal changes in light and temperature, which accounted for 75% of the variability of growth in algal yields. Salinity ranged from 31.0 to 36.5 parts per thousand and had insignificant effects on growth within this range. The original vegetative strain was maintained over the entire study without the need for additional supplementation from field-collected stock. Because of the pulse-fed nutrient supply, epiphytic growth on the target species was negligible (< 3% total biomass) throughout the study. The yields attained in this study rank among the highest reported for any intensively managed photosynthetic crop and demonstrate the feasibility of growing red macroalgae like Gracilaria at a sustained high yield in a large-scale, land-based culture system.

AB The sustainable transformation of an inert alkane into its corresponding oxygenates has been the subject of intense chemical research. These oxygenates typically produced from processes using stringent conditions and materials offer disadvantages that include decreased selectivities to the partial oxygenates and by-product formation. As environmental concerns and regulations become more rigorous, the need for alternative catalytic oxidation processes that use mild or ambient conditions is increased. In this Note, the authors have investigated the use of photocatalysis as a low-temperature and "green" alternative for the direct and selective oxidation of alkanes with molecular oxygen.

AB Using Taiwanese firm-level data, we confirm that foreign direct investment and R&D have a positive impact, or spillover effect on productivity. Furthermore, labour quality firm size, marker structure, and export orientation all affect a firm's productivity Applying Heckman's [1976] two-stage estimation method, we find that firms self-select into R&D or non-R&D groups. After correcting for this selection bias, we find that foreign direct investment, local technology purchase, and outward foreign investment are substitutes to R&D activity. These results are mainly due to the significant effect of industry-wide technology spillovers. The major policy implications derived from this study are that governments in developing countries may first wish to adopt policies encouraging foreign direct investment to foster technology transfer and industry-wide knowledge spillovers in the short run. However; once the country's technological capability is established it appears critical to switch towards policies that provide a preferred environment to stimulate R&D investment (for example, infrastructure improvement and protection of intellectual property rights) to allow for sustainable economic growth.

AB In shallow markets where there are mutual gains from cooperation among agents, collusive behavior may occur even if it does not constitute a Nash equilibrium. Yet, such behavior is rarely sustainable. Bolle (1994) reports the results of one-period team selection experiments in which subjects often did not follow the Nash equilibrium behavior but engaged in tacit collusion. We test the robustness of Bolle's findings by introducing asymmetry into subjects' characteristics and repeating the experiment for a number of periods. We find that collusion is not sustainable and the outcomes converge to levels close to the Nash equilibrium. However, the agent's actions stayed slightly above the Nash equilibrium level in all experiments. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

SO JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC DYNAMICS & CONTROL
LA English
DT Article
DE trade liberalization; growth; tariffs; learning-by-doing
AB This paper develops a model of ongoing trade liberalization as a self-enforcing equilibrium in a game between governments. Economic growth is a critical ingredient in successful trade liberalization. But differences in national growth rates have profound differences on the sustainable tariff equilibria of the game. If international technology spillovers are not concentrated in high-growth sectors, faster growing countries will be more protectionist, setting higher tariffs and liberalizing trade at a later date. But with spillovers more concentrated in high-growth sectors, faster-growing countries may be less protectionist. Differences in growth rates lead the process of trade liberalization to be far from reciprocal. A sustainable trade liberalization may actually involve one country pursuing a unilateral policy of free trade, even though its trading partner imposes tariffs against it.

TI Hazardous waste indicators for national decision makers
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE hazardous wastes; indicators; policy options; decision makers
ID SITES
AB Indicators and indices are important teals that assist decision makers to formulate and implement plans for management at local, national and international levels. Four indicators for hazardous waste management are described that have recently been adopted within the United Nations framework of Indicators of Sustainable Development. Although these four indicators will be useful tools, the need for a broader range of policy-relevant qualitative and quantitative indicators, proxy indicators and indices is outlined
   The argument is advanced that in order for all nations to better manage the range of hazardous waste issues, including waste generation, export/import and disposal, a set of innovative indicators and indices is required. Useful indicators and indices are described that could be used to link and quantify likely environmental, ecosystem and health impacts and risks especially from hazardous waste disposal. Indicators are also suggested that could be used to illustrate the shift in industrial strategy away from end-of-pipe processes towards waste recycling, cleaner production and integrated life-cycle analysis.
   It was concluded that until the lack of reliable and harmonized data on hazardous waste is addressed, indicator development and use by national and international decision makers cannot readily be implemented. (C) 1999 Academic Press.

AB Red and white axial muscle activity of adult Atlantic salmon Salmo salar was examined using conventional electromyography (EMGx) and activity radio-transmitters (EMGi) at 0.5 and 0.7 body lengths (L) along the body of the fish. Critical swimming trials were conducted and maximum sustainable speeds (U-crit) were unaffected by the presence of electrodes, being 1.51 +/- 0.21 m s(-1) (3.33 +/- 0.34 L s(-1)) (n=44). Regardless of longitudinal position of the electrodes within the musculature, both EMGxs and EMGis indicated increasing red muscle activity with increasing swimming speed, whereas white muscle fibres were recruited only at speeds >86 +/- 5% U-crit. Telemetered EMGi signals indicated that muscle activity varied significantly for electrodes implanted at different longitudinal positions along the fish (P<0.001). These results suggest that electrode placement is an important influence affecting the signals obtained from radio transmitters that estimate activity and location should be standardized within biotelemetry studies to allow accurate and consistent comparisons of activity between individuals and species. Optimal location for electrode placement was determined to be in the red muscle, towards the tail of the fish (0.7 L). (C) 1999 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles.

TI Forage production and nutritive value of three lespedeza cultivars
   intercropped into continuous no-till winter wheat
SO JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION AGRICULTURE

DT Article
ID WATER
AB Annual lespedezas [Kummerowia stipulacea (Maxim) Makin] have the potential to produce high quality forage during late summer when warm season forages are low in production and quality. A field study was conducted from 1992 through 1994 to determine DM, N, and digestible dry matter (DDM) production of three annual lespedeza cultivars (Korean, Kobe, and Marion), These cultivars were intercropped into two different continuous winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) production systems. Wheat was established in the fall under low tillage procedures in a 24-acre field, and grazed by steers from mid-November to mid-March at a stocking rate of 1 steer/acre. Before the wheat had reached the jointing stage, small plots were identified within the 24-acre wheat field. Inoculated lespedeza seeds were sown into the standing winter wheat in these plots, but grazing was continued on the plots and the field. At jointing, grazing was terminated on half of the plots (UNGRAZED), while the other half of the plots were grazed (GRAZED) until early May Samples of lespedeza were collected at 18 to 20 d intervals beginning in late-June and ending in late-September, in time for the next wheat crop to be planted. All treatments were fixed is space and repeated on the same plots each year Data were analyzed within year as a randomized complete block with cultivar as the main effect. In 1993 and 1994 Kobe produced DM, N, and DDM more (P < 0.05) under the UNGRAZED than the GRAZED management system. Management system had no effect on DM, N or DDM yield of Korean. When precipitation was above normal, Marion yielded more (P < 0.05) DM in the UNGRAZED plots than in the GRAZED plots, but Marion yield was inferior to that of Kobe and Korean under dry conditions. These results suggest that lespedeza can be intercropped in winter wheat to produce high quality forage during the summer. The availability of high quality forage, especially in late summer, can add sustainability to the livestock component of integrated Livestock and winter wheat production systems in the southern Great plains (SGP).

AB Our nation periodically reviews national water policy and considers its directions for the future. The most recent examination was directed at the western United States and the role of the federal agencies in meeting its needs. The West is no longer the frontier, but rather contains vibrant cities and booming centers of international trade, as well as tourism, mineral, and oil and gas development, agricultural, and other development. In this changing environment, federal water policies need to consider the long term sustainability of the West, provide justice to Indian tribes, protect the rivers and ecosystems on which natural systems depend, balance the needs of newcomers with those of agricultural users and communities, and meet a myriad of other demands. The Western Water Policy Review Advisory Commission has just concluded its review of these issues and issued its report. Key among the recommendations is the need to coordinate federal agencies at the basin and watershed level and make government more responsive to local needs, but within a framework that includes national mandates. The Commission's recommendations are presented here, along with some of the issues that surrounded the operations of the Commission.

AB During the last three decades, the World Health Organization has been actively involved in assisting countries and health authorities to improve their healthcare waste management. Wide disparities exist internationally on the standards of treatment and disposal of healthcare wastes which are achievable and sustainable in individual countries and localities. Three levels of practice can be identified: (i) a 'foundation' level in which some improvement in hospital hygiene and public health is achieved by removing wastes from wards to simple burning grounds and landfills, (ii) an 'intermediate' level whereby more organized collection and treatment is possible, and (iii) a more 'sophisticated' level involving treatment, enforcement of strict emission standards and landfilling regulations.
   This paper summarizes the range of practices in use and the options for (a) thermal treatment, (b) alternative technologies, and (c) engineered landfill. Details are also given on some of the activities undertaken by the World Health Organization in the areas of advice and guidance, direct assistance and research.

ID ALLOY-STEELS
AB The bainite transformation temperatures of eight high-silicon steels were determined metallographically. The bainite start (B-s) temperatures, which define the highest temperature at which bainite can form, all lay below the T-0 loci, where ferrite and austenite of the same chemical compositions have identical free energy. The established method of calculating B-s temperatures gave reasonable agreement with the experimental results. Careful study of the isothermally reacted samples revealed that Widmanstatten ferrite and bainite could both be observed, even at the beginning of the transformation, at around the B-s temperature. On the other hand, the lower bainite start (LBs) temperatures of these steels were found to be very close to the martensite start (M-s) temperatures. Silicon is considered to be responsible for depressing the LBs temperature by retarding the formation of cementite. The coformation of upper and lower bainite near the LBs temperature is also confirmed. The results indicate that the displacive formation mechanism of bainite is sustainable.

AB This lecture series began in 1971 focused on the links between materials, energy, and the environment. The issue of sustainability had emerged, but only as an exploration of the possibility of materials depletion in the face of predicted population growth. Today, sustainability implies a global economic and social system that both satisfies human needs and does not despoil the earth, What has been our role in this increasingly important arena of human concern and what should it be?
   Our report card is impressive. Improvements in processing, in materials substitution, in design to minimize materials usage, and in recycling of metals and polymers have all been remarkable, However, we are faced with twin dreadnoughts of change in the next decades: technological ascendency of developing nations and rising world population. Add to these the need to reduce the effluence of greenhouse gases and we must anticipate formidable technological upheaval throughout the materials cycle.
   Our professional societies need to step forward and play larger and significantly more visible roles in this arena. Working individually and in concert with others, the societies must broadcast our achievements, identify future areas for activity, support industrial road-mapping efforts, and join with all who will participate in clarifying the flow of materials throughout their life cycles.

AB Aircraft data from the Tropical Ocean/Global Atmosphere Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere Response Experiment (TOGA-COARE) indicate the validity of current conceptual models used in cumulus parametrization theories. This study makes use of 1 s (similar to 100 m) measurements of temperature, dew-point temperature and pressure taken along the aircraft flight tracks and airborne radar data. The radar data are used to determine the location, depth and horizontal extent of the convection and to categorize the thermodynamic data according to whether the measurements were obtained in precipitation areas or in regions of inflow to convection.
   Inflow regions had the highest values of equivalent potential temperature (theta(e)), both in the boundary layer and lower free atmosphere, where the convection was deepest and most horizontally extensive, implying a relationship of theta(e) to both the depth and breadth of convection. The observations suggest that the thickness of the layer of high-theta(e) air may determine the sustainability and, therefore, the horizontal extent of warm-pool convection. The spectrum of values of theta(e) in the boundary layer of inflow regions was broad, indicating that the field of theta(e) was highly non-uniform at the 1 s (similar to 100 m) scale sampled by the aircraft.
   The boundary-layer air in precipitating regions also exhibited a broad spectrum of theta(e) values, indicating the presence of both outflow from downdraughts and a significant amount of air with characteristics similar to inflow regions. The lowest values in the distribution were about 345 K, suggesting that air parcels transported down into the boundary layer originated from no higher than about 1500 m, or that they underwent substantial mixing.

   EFFICACY; INTEGRATION; MEASLES
AB In just under a quarter of a century, the Expanded Programme on Immunisation has been associated with an increase in infant immunisation coverage from around 5% to 80%, and the prevention of at least 3 million deaths annually, at very low cost. The global target of poliomyelitis eradication by the year 2000 appears feasible. Measles is the next likely target for eradication via immunisation, through 'catch-up', 'keep up' and 'follow-up' strategies which have proven highly effective in the Americas.
   Yet much needs to be done in order to extend readily achievable immunisation benefits equitably to all the world's people and to realise the potential of existing and soon to be available vaccines for disease control and eradication, as experience with yellow fever and hepatitis B vaccines demonstrates. Unsafe injection practices are widespread, have received inadequate attention, and cause a substantial global burden of blood-borne infections.
   The risk of increasing global inequity in immunisation highlights the centrality of resource allocation priorities in determining the extent to which the benefits of immunisation will be realised, particularly for new vaccines which are significantly more costly than established EPI vaccines. WHO/UNICEF strategies to target more effectively immunisation support to the neediest countries, to prioritise new vaccines, and to target carefully vaccine procurement and encourage sharply tiered vaccine pricing support both equity and sustainability. However, increasing the resources available to immunisation is vital and requires powerful advocacy on public health, moral, cost-effectiveness and legal grounds. More appropriate resource allocation priorities could readily provide the means necessary to address both technical and operational immunisation challenges. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB This article describes a flexible primary health care methodology which was developed by Andean Rural Health Care and its colleagues in Bolivia, South America, This methodology, the census-based, impact-oriented (CBIO) approach to primary health care, involves determining local health priorities as defined both by locally acquired epidemiologic information and by the local people themselves. The CBIO approach to primary health care is now functioning successfully at seven program sites in Bolivia, which together serve 75,000 people in urban and rural communities in three distinct cultural and ecological regions of the country.
   High levels of coverage of basic health services can be achieved through a system of 'epidemographic' surveillance of all families and through home delivery, when needed, of priority services to those at risk. When the services provided are based on local health priorities, when they are provided in a technically effective manner, and when the community has a strong partnership in planning, implementation and evaluation, then the CBIO approach to primary health care will lead to measurable health improvements as defined by changes in population-based rates of mortality and illness in the community.
   On the basis of our experience, we believe that the CBIO approach offers great potential for strengthening the effectiveness of local health programs in impoverished communities around the world in a way which fosters community ownership and, hence, long-term sustainability.

AB Soil resilience has recently been introduced into soil science to address sustainability of the soil resource and to combat sail degradation. The concept of soil resilience and its relationship to soil quality have not been well defined or well developed, The main objectives of this paper are to clarify the concept: of soil resilience and its relationship to soil quality and to present a framework for its assessment. A review of the literature on the assessment and quantification of soil resilience is presented and discussed, The concept of soil resilience in combination with resistance is presented as an important component of soil quality, a key element of sustainability. Factors that affect soil resilience and resistance are soil type and vegetation, climate, land use, scale, and disturbance regime. Maintenance of recovery mechanisms after a disturbance is critical for system recovery. Three approaches for assessing soil resilience are presented: (i) directly measuring recovery after a disturbance, (ii) quantifying the integrity of recovery mechanisms after a disturbance, and (iii) measuring properties that serve as indicators of those recovery mechanisms. Research is needed in the development of indicators or quantitative measures of the ability of soils to recover from specific disturbances.

ID CARBON STORAGE; MANAGED FORESTS; STRATEGIES; TREES
AB Forests can be harvested and regrown on a sustainable basis while harvested material is used to either store carbon in long-lived wood products or to displace carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel combustion. To frame the question whether this implies that harvesting forests is an effective strategy for mitigating the increase of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, we use a carbon accounting model to ask how long it takes to return to the original carbon balance after a forest stand is clear-cut harvested for biofuels and other forest products. Although the numerical solution depends on a great variety of site-specific model input parameters, it is clear that the system will not return to its original carbon balance for a very long time (perhaps centuries) unless forest products are produced and used efficiently. Especially when the cycle of producing forest products involves initial harvest of a forest stand with a large standing stock of biomass, there is likely to be a long-standing debit in terms of net carbon emissions to the atmosphere. On the other hand, if forest harvest is produced and used with high efficiency and the rate of regrowth is high, potential carbon benefits can be very high over time and it is possible that there is never a carbon debit with respect to forest protection, even immediately following harvest. Any intent to use forest harvesting to help mitigate the buildup of carbon dioxide in the earth's atmosphere should be able to demonstrate that the forest regrowth and product use can compensate for the loss of carbon from the forest as a result of the initial harvest.

AB Increasing car ownership, the use people make of cars and the changes in the patterns of land use are the root causes of people's concerns about traffic congestion, pollution, sustainability and safety. A long-term strategy is needed to solve the problems. The strategy should include education to encourage changes in behaviour; reshaping our towns and cities to reduce the need for personal mobility by mechanized transport; improved public transport; building more roads; the rapid introduction of new technology; more fuel-effective vehicles; pricing mechanisms to give the right incentives; and new sources of funds to finance the solutions.

TI Conditions of success in sustainable urban transport policy - Policy
   change in 'relatively successful' European cities
SO TRANSPORT REVIEWS
LA English
DT Article
AB The paper outlines some preliminary results of an ongoing study on 'conditions of success in sustainable transport policies in cities'. The study consists of a comparative analysis of five case studies dealing with relatively successful European cities in three countries: Zurich, Basle (Switzerland), Amsterdam, Groningen (The Netherlands) and Freiburg (Germany). Having in mind the ongoing deterioration of traffic-related environmental problems in cities, the paper proceeds in a three-step approach: by describing the trends of transport of persons and the environment in general and of forerunner cities in particular, the opportunities and limits of sustainable urban transport developments are detected in a first step. In a second step, the degrees and patterns of environmentally oriented policy changes in relatively successful cities are outlined. The third step focuses on the reasons and ways policy windows open up for fundamental environmentally oriented changes of transport policies. It is argued that 'macro-windows' for such changes only open up due to strong and enduring forces originally from outside the local political system. Social crises and impressive political mandates were identified as important external factors that influenced the 'greening' of urban transport in the relatively successful cities. However, an open macro-window is only conceived as a political opportunity for change, a necessary but not sufficient condition. Whether or to what extent these opportunities are utilized depends on further factors.

AB The productivity of the agricultural enterprises in the Province of Guimaras, a small island in the Philippines, is observed to be low Small farmers generally find that their farm income is insufficient to meet their cost of living. Despite a potential for vegetable production, which can be more profitable than most other agricultural enterprises, only few local farmers engage in the activity. Most locally sold vegetables come from other provinces. Facing this fact, and the heavy and indiscriminate application of synthetic agro-chemicals in Philippine vegetable production with all its resulting problems, it was decided by the Provincial Government to especially promote organic vegetable farming in the province.
   The project that was conceptualized uses a two-pronged strategy, offering to its cooperators information on both organic and integrated production methods. Cooperators producing organically reduce pest and disease infestation by employing cultural and mechanical methods and control them, if necessary, by biological methods. The project stresses that botanicals are no panacea and may be as hazardous as synthetic agrochemicals if used indiscriminately. The results obtained show a clear potential for organic vegetable production. Gross production output and marketable yields from organic production are so far not significantly different to those produced under Integrated Crop Management (ICM). Both production systems produce higher yields than the conventional production method (farmer's practice). This fact is due to the very low productivity of the latter.
   Notwithstanding, as organic farming is more labor-intensive and carries a perceived increased risk of crop failure, farmers expect to realize higher market prices, while in the local markets organic products have to compete with non-organic products on the same price levels. To realize higher prices, cooperators must engage in direct marketing. It can be concluded that organic production makes most sense in areas situated close to cities or population centers, where markets and individual consumers are easily accessible and willing to pay higher prices for healthier products Notwithstanding, the Guimaras experience shows that organic vegetable production, while more labor and knowledge-intensive than the "conventional'" way of farming, can be economically viable even in an unfavorable market environment. While further research is needed, this experience can indisputably serve as a model to other small farmers.

ID ANIMAL HEALTH-SERVICES
AB Ghana is on the verge of privatizing selected activities in the delivery of animal health services. However, various constraints are being encountered. The aim of this paper is to identify these constraints so as to help nd solutions to them.
   Questionnaires were administered to veterinarians in Ghana to elicit their responses on various issues concerning privatization. A significant proportion (61%) of government veterinarians, who formed 94% of the respondents, were unwilling to go into private practice. Among the reasons given were that private practice was too risky, that farmers were unwilling or unable to pay for services, that capital to start practices was lacking and that the societal value for animals was low. Also, low livestock densities in many areas and the absence of commercial livestock farming were perceived as deterrents to the sustainability of private practice. Furthermore, the poor macroeconomic environment of high inflation, high interest rates and unstable currency discouraged investment.
   If privatization of veterinary services is to succeed in Ghana, these perceptions have to be addressed and solutions found, since veterinarians are the targets of the privatization process.

AB The housing sector is the last major sector of the national economy for which analytical foundations for economic and financial policy evaluation have developed. However, the application of this analytical framework to international comparisons of housing policies or the evaluation of housing finance systems still lags considerably behind the strong foundations laid over the years for trade, finance or industry policy analyses. None the less, the era when improvisation and fragmented policy-making in housing and housing finance could be excused is well past. Today, there is a deep and expanding body of basic research and policy analysis that can be shared for the design of housing policies and housing finance institutions whether it is in the European Union of developing countries. Obviously, social and economic contexts as well as wealth levels differ greatly. Common analytical foundations can lead to very different prescriptions in countries where macroeconomic and financial policies, financial infrastructure, and urban laws policies and practices differ. In some countries, the institutions of the markets are so deep that we may no longer be fully aware of them. In others, they barely exist. Everywhere, the division of labour between public and private actions in both housing policy and housing finance is shifting. Like European countries, but at much lower levels of income and wealth, developing countries continue to seek growth with equity. However, those are countries where the majority of people are poor, cities are growing rapidly, public as well as private institutions are often weak and fiscal resources are severely constrained. In such environments, it seems to stand to reason that the financing of social housing should only be a subset of public concerns for the development of a safe and sound housing finance system that will be able to expand in step with urbanisation. The question addressed here is where the financing of social housing fits within the new world of housing finance. The search for alternative forms of housing finance for low-income groups cannot disregard overall trends affecting the financial sector and hope to be sustainable. It has become clear during the past two decades that there is no such thing as a homogeneous 'Third World' across which identical policies and instruments could be conveniently applied. This simplistic concept resulted from the Cold War, ignorance of distant foreign places and, in particular, of their specific human capital, laws, institutions and practices. The reality in housing finance, as well as in other areas of public policy, is that there are profound differences among the more than 180 advanced and developing countries that are now members of the World Bank. It is therefore important to think of housing finance as 'path-dependent' in the sense that any innovation will be shaped by past and current conditions. One can distinguish six broad types of housing finance systems. Their main features are briefly outlined here. In spite of such international diversity, the separation of subsidies from finance and the redesign of social housing finance programmes are everywhere a critical reference for the design and development of better housing finance systems.

AB Efficiency enhancement in irrigation distribution system (IDS) contributes to substantial water savings. This paper aims to present the methodology and lessons learned from efforts to improve efficiency in the irrigation distribution system of Jericho City. This effort presents a new paradigm in water management in water scarce countries, which focuses on both supply and demand management rather than on supply augmentation. Converting the existing irrigation canal system to a pressurized pipe network carries out rehabilitation of IDS in Jericho City. Analysis of the new IDS is performed through computer simulation. Considerations and constraints for sustainable irrigation management are presented.

AB Five cultivation implements (two flex-tine cultivators, brush hoe, and rolling and shovel cultivators) were evaluated for weed control and effect on broccoli, snap bean, and sweet corn yield. Each implement was used alone or in combination with flex-tine cultivators. Standard broadcast herbicide treatments were: broccoli, metolachlor at 2.3 kg ai/ha posttransplant; snag bean, metolachlor preemergence (PRE) at 2.3 kg ai/ha followed by fomesafen postemergence (POST) at 0.4 kg ai/ha; sweet corn, atrazine at 1.1 kg ai/ha plus metolachlor at 2.3 kg ai/ha PRE. In the snap bean trials, an additional treatment consisted of metolachlor at 2.3 kg ai/ha PRE applied in a 25-cm band over the crop row followed by fomesafen POST at 0.4 kg ai/ha directed at the crop row, with a subsequent shovel cultivation. In the sweet corn trials, all cultivation treatments received an application of atrazine at 1.1 kg ai/ha plus metolachlor at 2.3 kg ai/ha PRE in a 25-cm band over the crop row. In broccoli, weed control and yields with all cultivation treatments were comparable to those with broadcast herbicide. In snap bean, flex-tine cultivators failed to control weeds and prevent yield reductions compared to the broadcast herbicide treatment. When either the brush hoe or the shovel cultivator was preceded by flex-tine cultivation, weed control and snap bean yield were comparable to those with broadcast herbicides. Banded herbicides followed by shovel cultivation also controlled weeds and prevented yield reductions. In sweet corn, banded herbicides controlled in-row weeds, and despite variable between-row weed control, all cultivation treatments yielded as well as the broadcast herbicide treatment. Relative performance of the cultivators was influenced by soil type and rainfall as well as crop canopy characteristics.

AB The paper describes background, initial experience, and future challenges associated with a new "negotiated" approach to land reform. This approach has emerged as? following the end of the Cold War and broad macroeconomic adjustment, many countries face a "second generation" of reforms to address deep-rooted structural problems and provide the basis for sustainable poverty reduction and economic growth. It reviews possible theoretical links-through credit market or political channels-between asset ownership and economic performance. Program characteristics in each country, as well as lessons for implementation, and implications for monitoring and impact assessment are discussed. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

TI Agricultural tradables and economic recovery in Uganda: The limitations
   of structural adjustment in practice
SO WORLD DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Uganda's economic reform program has been widely regarded as a success story for structural adjustment. Nevertheless, a large trade deficit persists, shored up by inflows of aid and private remittances, The poor performance of the agricultural tradables sector is presented as the key explanation for this trade imbalance. Two main reasons for this poor performance are found to be the failure to liberalize producer prices quickly and the failure to overcome early institutional resistance to reforms of marketing arrangements. Uganda's recovery is therefore much less impressive than it appears and the sustainability of the now heavily aid-dependent economy must remain in serious doubt. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Reverse micelles serve as a novel tool to entrap enzymes and microbial whole cells within aqueous pockets and can be of great use in enhancing the efficiency and sustainability of the biological system. Photosynthetic bacterium Rhodopseudomonas sphaeroides entrapped inside the aqueous pool of reverse micelles prepared from benzene-sodium lauryl sulphate exhibited 25-fold enhancement of H-2 photoproduction rate (1.67 ml H-2 [mg protein](-1) h(-1)) compared to cells suspended in normal aqueous medium. Hydrogen photoproduction by the bacterium was catalysed by the nitrogenase enzyme system which was supported at a low light intensity of 12 mu E m(-2) sec(-1) photon flux energy at a wavelength of 520 nm. The optimum temperature for the process was 40 degrees C.

AB We show that high levels of both carbon sources (sugars) and cations (notably magnesium) in the growth medium enhance the frequency of heterocyst formation by three-fold over the control in Nostoc sp. Such an alteration in the frequency and in enzyme activity (hydrogenase and nitrogenase), induced a proportional increase in hydrogen evolution capacity under a variety of conditions. Nitrogenase and hydrogenase activity also showed an increase in the enriched cultures. Our results therefore suggest that enriching the Nostoc culture with some selected carbon source or a low cost inorganic source like magnesium would result in a high yield of heterocysts in heterocystous cyanobacteria which would be helpful in the production of sustainable bio-fuels.

AB Growth of five Asian red tilapia strains (BFS, NIFI, FAG, PF and HL) were evaluated in brackish and seawater. Eight-week-old juveniles from the five test strains were size-matched with similarly aged Oreochromis mossambicus which served as internal reference. Fish were stocked at a ratio of 15 test:15 reference in 100-1 tanks supported by a recirculating system. Commercial feed was given twice daily at 10-20% of the fish biomass. Growth, measured from length and weight increment at 10 weeks, was recorded. Statistical analyses on mean specific growth rates showed significant differences among the strains reared in seawater. The Philippine strain PF grew best in seawater while the Thai strain NIFI performed well in brackishwater. In the Philippines, red tilapias are farmed in intensive freshwater culture systems by few aquaculturists. Results of this study indicate that some Asian strains can be developed for use in more sustainable brackish and seawater culture systems. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Science-based assessment and management of any specific risks is needed for sustainable use of genetically modified aquatic organisms (aquatic GMOs). The Performance Standards for Safely Conducting Research with Genetically Modified Fish and Shellfish were developed to guide risk assessment and risk management for proposed experiments with aquatic GMOs. A researcher answers a series of questions about the organism and the accessible aquatic ecosystem, leading to either identification of specific risks or to the conclusion that there is a specific reason for safety of the experiment. Should any specific risk be identified, the researcher is led to consider risk management measures, involving culture methods, facilities design, and operations management. Documented completion of the Performance Standards can facilitate approval of an experiment by oversight authorities. The Performance Standards were adopted by the US Department of Agriculture in 1996. The Performance Standards were converted into an interactive, computer-based decision support tool, which can be obtained on diskette from the authors or accessed from the Internet at http://www.nbiap.vt.edu. A DOS-based program (693 kilobytes) can be downloaded and run on any DOS-based microcomputer with a 386 or later processor. Alternatively, an interactive, Internet browser-based program, accessible at the same website, also offers pictures of key equipment and facilities. Within either format, explanatory text, literature citations, and a glossary are accessible from any point in the decision-making path. The software automatically generates a trace of the user's path through the decision questions, thereby automating completion of most of the worksheet. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB The 'epidemiologic revolution' of the 1960s arose in response to the inability of reductionist methods to provide practical solutions to the complex problems of health and production in livestock systems. In a farm, there are not only interactions between animal factors and herd husbandry factors such as feeding, housing, and microbiological environment, but also with a number of other 'non-animal' factors. For this reason, a 'global' or 'holistic' approach, aimed at explaining animal health status within the overall dynamic of a livestock production system, was developed in France under the title of 'ecopathology'. In ecopathology, the discipline of epidemiology is integrated into a systemic approach, including: the development of a preliminary conceptual model, sampling based on the structure of the livestock production system, the establishment of a field study by a multidisciplinary team, the organization and management of the animal health and production information, data analysis, the distribution of results to all participants and the development of a preventive medicine programme.
   The farm is also influenced by the social, economic and environmental setting to which it belongs. To account for this, a change of scale is necessary. The three elements of the livestock production system considered in ecopathology (farmer, herd and resources), at the level of the agroecosystem become a human community (farmers, consumers, decision-makers), an animal population, and the complex of human, social and economic conditions within the system. The concept of agroecosystem health is closely linked to the overall principle of improving the sustainability of the system. This and other measures of the health status of an agroecosystem can be assessed with methods developed by epidemiologists and other disciplines within a system's perspective. In this systems view, ecopathology provides a basis for assessing herd health whereas agroecosystem health develops the broader context into which ecopathology contributes.

AB Agroforestry systems have been considered sustainable land-use alternatives for the humid tropics because they may imitate characteristics of natural ecosystems - notably those that have beneficial effects on soil properties. The objective of this study was to compare the effects of agroforestry systems on selected soil properties of Haplic and Dystic Fluvisols, in the Atlantic Region of Costa Rica, approximately five years after their establishment. The agroforestry systems were established on unmanaged pastures near the La Selva Biological Station in 1989 and 1990. The original forest had been removed on most of these areas at least 25 years earlier. Three components of the agroforestry systems were the tropical hardwoods Vochysia ferruginea (Botarrama), V. guatemalensis (Chancho), Strypnodendron microstachyum (Vainello) and Hieronyma alchorneoides (Pilon). The soil properties studied included physical (soil bulk density; 0-10 cm), chemical [pH, exchangeable bases, extractable P, soil organic C (SOC) and total soil N; 0-50cm] and biological parameters (mineralizable C and N and microbial biomass C and N; 0-15 cm). Soils were sampled in August 1995. Lower exchangeable bases and soil pH were noted in agroforestry treatments as compared to pastures. Extractable P was higher in the surface 25 cm of agroforestry plots. Total soil N, soil organic C and soil C:N ratios were not influenced by agroforestry systems. Higher mineralizable C levels were observed in pasture surface soils, but no differences in mineralizable N in soil under pasture and agroforestry systems were observed. Soil microbial biomass C and N and specific respiratory activity were not significantly different in pastures and agroforestry systems. Agroforestry systems did not appear to improve soils in this study compared to pasture. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

   short-rotation forests: implications for land management

AB Litter fall plays a major role in the cycling of energy and nutrients in woodland ecosystems. The amount of litter produced and nutrients returned in two population-density trials of Eucalyptus brookerana and E. saligna short rotation forests were monitored over a one-year period in Palmerston North, New Zealand. The results showed that the higher the plant density, the greater the weight of the litter fall and with higher levels of nutrients. The differences were less evident after tree canopy closure. The highest annual litter fall recorded was >10 Mg ha(-1) oven dry, of which leaves contributed over 90%. Total nitrogen and phosphorus return was up to 140 and 8.2 kg ha(-1), respectively. About 70% to 80% of the total annual litter fall occurred during summer time. To minimise depletion of nutrients from the site, trees should be harvested in autumn or winter to ensure a sustainable production system. However, to remove as many nutrients as possible in an effluent land treatment system where nutrient removal is the main objective, trees should be harvested in summer before the peak time of nutrient return.

AB Forest management must change radically to maintain biodiversity. 'Biodiversity' has many components, but only one has been measured unambiguously - species richness - although there is recently much emphasis on structural, process, and functional diversity. So we must determine exactly what aspects of biodiversity to seek, and why. A battery of suggestions about how to achieve this re-focus on biodiversity (e.g., ecosystem management and the 'new forestry') are catchwords rather than guides on how to manage forests on the ground. These suggestions stem from an ill-defined concept of 'forest health,' which can be seen variously depending on the desired role and state of a forest. Ecosystem management for some versions of forest health may even decrease some forms of biodiversity. A decline in species richness need not lead to a decline in the process diversity or rates. Evidence that species richness contributes to ecosystem maintenance and function is scant. Thus, effective management for biodiversity (generally species richness) entails a frank commitment to maintain biodiversity as an end, not as a means. Some suggestions to maintain forest biodiversity while still allowing timber production, such as uneven-aged stand management and various burning regimes, are focused squarely on species richness per se, but they are hypotheses, not scientifically validated procedures. Existing empirical measurements on such techniques are usually on the amount and sustainability of timber harvest, not on how well they maintain species richness. A wealth of scientific research is needed, involving landscape-level field manipulations and careful natural historical observations on the effects on various species. The idea that forests can always serve multiple uses, including wood production and maintenance of all species, is an untested hypothesis. It may be incorrect; maintaining some species may require extensive pristine tracts. The major requirement for almost all research needed to manage forests for biodiversity is extensive and intensive monitoring. The concepts of umbrella and indicator species as management shortcuts are barely tested. Their utility can be validated only by intensive field study. Valuable umbrellas and/or indicators may exist for some forest systems. However, management procedures should not evolve towards management of indicator species, as the indicator might cease to indicate the status of other species. By contrast, managing an umbrella species is not an inherent contradiction in terms, but different umbrella species may shelter different sets of species, so management for one might be inimical to the other. The concept of keystone species may be useful in forest management. If the fates of particular species determine those of many others, managing for such keystones may effectively maintain species richness. But recognition of a keystone species requires well-designed experiments. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The validity and use of the indicator species concept, the design of logging impact studies, the need for long-term monitoring programs and how they might be designed, and, trade-offs between conservation strategies and economic costs are topics critical to the future direction of biological conservation in managed forests. The indicator species concept can make an important contribution to biodiversity conservation because of the impossibility of monitoring all taxa in species-rich forest environments. However, the concept has yet to be rigourously tested by validating relationships between an indicator species and entities for which it is hypothesized to be indicative. There can be serious negative consequences if the indicator species concept is incorrectly applied or inappropriate species are selected as indicators. Long-term monitoring will be critical for assessing not only the validity of concepts like indicator species, but also for appraising other rarely tested approaches to conservation in managed forests such as: (1) stand level management strategies to create and maintain key structural and floristic attributes that form critical habitat components for wildlife (e.g. large living and dead trees), (2) landscape level strategies to ensure the maintenance of landscape heterogeneity and connectivity, such as the establishment of networks of riparian protection zones and wildlife corridors, and, (3) landscape and regional level management involving the identification of reserves. While the importance of monitoring is often discussed, more programs are needed to gather the data needed to inform the development of ecologically sustainable forest management practices. Treating forestry activities as an experiment and overlaying well-designed monitoring pro,srams on such disturbance regimes is one useful way to accumulate key information on the effects of logging on biodiversity and how to mitigate such impacts. However, some major changes will be needed to instigate greater commitment to monitoring programs. These include: (1) identifying innovative ways to secure long-term funding that can be guaranteed beyond typical political and institutional timeframes, (2) education of funding bodies to ensure they recognise that useful results may take a prolonged period to obtain and that monitoring is not a second-rate science, (3) greater participation in the design and execution of monitoring programs by the scientific community, and, (4) stronger links among researchers and between researchers and managers to both improve the quality and validity of monitoring studies and to ensure that the results of such programs are incorporated into management practices.

AB Field traffic by heavy agricultural machinery can cause serve structural degradation of arable land. This may result in surface runoff, restricted availability of water, oxygen and nutrients to plant roots and therefore in reduced crop yields. In order to prevent these impacts and to develop appropriate counter-measures the complete compaction process must be understood. In this study the effect of increasing dynamic loads on the stress and strain relationship was examined using a stress state transducer (SST) attached to a displacement transducer system (DTS). Three different dynamic loads, ranging from 13.2 to 25.3 kN, were applied each by two passes on a firm sandy loam (Typic Kandiudults) at 10% wheel slip. During the first pass the calculated major principal (sigma(1)), mean normal (MNS) and octahedral shear stresses (OCTSS) increased significantly with increasing dynamic loads. For the second pass in contrast to these calculated stress values, except the major principal (sigma(1)), were not affected by the applied dynamic loads. While the vertical displacement of the transducer during the first pass was more than doubled with each dynamic load step, the soil volume element above the transducer was vertically deformed at a constant rate of 25%, independent of the dynamic load. Since no further vertical deformation of this soil volume element was induced by the second pass and additional vertical soil movement was detected, soil compaction is expected to progress to deeper soil layers as the dynamic load and the wheeling frequency increases. Thus the reduction of wheel loads and the avoidance of repeated wheeling events in one tire track may contribute to a sustainable land management of firm soils. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Human oral mucosal cells are an attractive site for tissue engineering because they are the most accessible cells in the body and easy to manipulate in vitro. They thus have possibilities for targeting by somatic gene therapy. We examined the efficiency of retrovirus-mediated gene transfer and the construction of mucosal epithelium in vivo. Human oral mucosal cells were transduced with a retroviral vector carrying the lacZ gene at high efficiency and constructed epithelium after G418 selection with 3T3 cells in vitro. The cultured oral mucosal epithelium membrane was then grafted onto immunodeficient mice. beta-Gal expression was detected histochemically in vivo 5 weeks after grafting. Furthermore, we transduced factor IX cDNA into the mucosal epithelium membrane, and it was then transplanted into nude mice. Between 0.6 and 1.8 ng of human factor IX per milliliter was found in mouse plasma, and the production was continued for 23 days in vivo. These results confirmed that the oral mucosal epithelium is an ideal target tissue for gene therapy or tissue engineering.

AB When a work scenario in protective clothing is a nominal two hours of work followed by a short break, the level of heat stress must be limited to conditions of thermal equilibrium. By comparing changes in maximum sustainable work rate in a fixed environment, differences due to different protective clothing ensembles can be determined. To illustrate this principle, two protective clothing ensembles were examined. The Basic Ensemble was a cotton blend coverall over gym shorts with hard hat, gloves and full face mask respirator. The Enhanced Ensemble added a light weight, surgical scrub suit under the coveralls, plus a hood worn under the hard hat. Five young, acclimated males were the test subjects. Environmental conditions were fixed at T-db = 32 degrees C and T-pwb = 26 degrees C. After a physiological steady state was established at a low rate of work, treadmill speed was increased by 0.04 m/s every 5 min. The trial continued until thermal equilibrium was clearly lost. A critical treadmill speed was noted at the point thermal equilibrium was lost for each ensemble and subject. The drop in treadmill speed from the basic to enhanced ensemble was 11%. Based on measured values of average skin temperature and metabolic rate at the critical work rate and estimated values of clothing insulation, the average evaporative resistances for the basic and enhanced ensembles were 0.018 and 0.026 kPa m(2)/W, respectively.

AB There are high social and ecological costs linked to globalization of non-sustainable agriculture which have been experienced in all commercially-grown and chemically-farmed crops in all regions. While the benefits of globalisation go tu the seeds and chemical corporations through expanding markets, the cost and risks ape exclusively born by the small farmers and landless peasants. While the commercial private seed supply system needs strong state regulation, farmer seed supply should function free of state interference with strong community control and public participation. Strong biosafety regulation with public participation is both a democratic and an ecological imperative.

   efficiency; nuclear fusion
AB The fertility rate for women and the related population growth rate for numerous developing (transitional) countries show a downward trend with increasing annual per capita energy use. On the assumption that such trends will continue, estimates are made for some simple cases of the energy demands required to stabilize the world's population in the period 2100-2150.
   An assessment is made of how these energy demands might be met, capitalizing as much as possible on the indigenous energy resources for each of the ten major regions of the world: North America, Latin America, Europe OECD, Former Soviet Union and Central and Eastern Europe, China, Pacific OECD, East Asia, South Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. Consideration is also given to the potential need to limit carbon emissions because of global-warming concerns.
   The study highlights the crucial nature of energy-efficiency improvements and the need to use all energy sources if the world is to find a sustainable future with a much improved standard of living in the developing world. While, globally, there are huge resources of fossil fuels, they are unevenly distributed and some of the areas experiencing major population growth are not well endowed with them. Even allowing for the substantial deployment of renewable energies (biomass, geothermal, hydro-,tide, wave and wind power), if fossil-fuel use is restricted or has limited availability, there will be a need in a number of regions (e.g. South Asia) for substantial amounts of nuclear and solar energy to meet their long-term needs.
   The deployment of more fission power can build upon the existing successes. The availability of fusion power will depend upon the pace of the development program and, in principle, fusion-power deployment might start around the middle of the 21st century. Example scenarios of possible contributions of the various energy sources are described, to illustrate the potential roles for fission and fusion power.

TI Use of thematic mapper imagery with a geographic information system for
   geomorphologic mapping in a large deltaic lowland environment
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
LA English
DT Article
AB Landform mapping in the deltaic lowland environment is complicated by the rapid and significant changes of many fluvial forms and lowland coasts and the poor topographic expressions of the landforms. The timely updating of landform maps is of critical significance beyond geomorphology itself, into broader fields of environmental management and sustainable development. Existing techniques need to be tailored and refined towards the operational mode for full functioning of landform mapping. This study presents an example of the application of Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data and image processing and geographic information system (GIS) techniques to geomorphologic mapping in a large deltaic lowland environment. Data acquisition, processing, integration, analysis, interpretation and presentation were performed under a GIS environment, in which a terrain mapping unit database linking both geospatial and attribute data was built up. A terrain classification map was produced and further validated with Global Positioning System-guided field checks and observations. Results show that TM interpretation with a GIS allows an accurate geomorphological classification of terrain in accordance with the level of mapping scale used. With some caution, this method might be used in highly dynamic deltaic environments.

AB Evaluating sustainability in forest management requires decision makers to consider multiple, conflicting definitions in an environment of risk, uncertainty, and incomplete or non-quantitative information Zadeh's fuzzy set theory provides a rigorous, flexible approach to the problem of defining and evaluating sustainability and comparing alternative scenarios. We discuss how fuzzy set concepts can be used to better manage for goals such as sustainability, equity, and ecosystem health. We then show how a simple tabular technique using fuzzy sets can be used to compare management alternatives, incorporate multiple objectives, and identify knowledge gaps and areas of disagreement. The simplicity and flexibility of this technique provides needed support for mon explicit. objective decisions. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents a method to address two wildlife management problems in central African rainforests: the need for local communities to take responsibility for wildlife management, and the lack of simple and appropriate wildlife monitoring techniques. The method uses encounters of game species during net hunts to calculate abundance indices as well as to estimate population densities for the four principal game species in the Dzanga-Sangha region: the duikers Cephalophus monticola (10.7-20.4 km(-2)),C. dorsalis (1.2-2.0 km(-2)), and C. callipygus (0.9-1.2 km(-2)), and the brush-tailed porcupine Atherurus africanus (2.7-5.3 km(-2)). Game species behaviour, the hunting practice, and comparisons with results from other research across central Africa suggest that the method can provide valid density estimates for C. monticola and C. dorsalis, but only abundance indices for C. callipygus and A. africanus. Nevertheless, the method can be applied by hunters in the course of their normal activities, and is adapted to the local habitat types and game species. As such, it can be an important tool for local communities in developing sustainable wildlife management programmes.

AB Food security for the world in 2025 is possible and probable if the right set of things are done, starting now. But the task will not be easy. It is both a technology and a political/economic challenge. The challenge for sub-Saharan Africa is even greater. While other regions improved per capita food availability over the last 30 years, Africa's availability declined. But food security is about more than supply. It is also about access which means income generating employment is critical. Meeting future requirements in Africa and the world will require sustainable intensification of complex production systems, appropriate national and international policies and continued investments in agricultural research. Without these conditions and increased employment intensive growth, prospects for the future are less bright. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In The Netherlands, new farming systems have been developed that combine environmental sustainability with technical feasibility. Adoption of these new production strategies in practice seems to be hampered by their association with high levels of risks. In the case of weed control in sugar beet the risks of the new techniques concern manageability and probability of success in relation to meteorological aspects. The Bio-Economic model on STrategy choice in Weed control IN Sugar beet (BESTWINS) allows an efficient and consistent comparison of strategies ranging from conventional to environmentally friendly with respect to risk. Risk is calculated by implementing the various strategies under a range of meteorologically determined conditions. Risk is measured by the statistical value distributions of characteristic parameters of the weed control strategies; e.g. cost and required labour and active chemical ingredient. Calculations show that more sustainable strategies do not necessarily imply an increase in risk. Labour requirements for manual weeding are generally higher than for the biological strategy, but under exceptional conditions (95% point) other strategies show high requirements as well. Intensive tractor use increases labour requirements for strategies with row spraying combined with mechanical techniques. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Sustainability is a human-centred concept that comprises multiple aspects and objectives of different interest groups. Sustainable development is not readily measurable, except as a compromise between different parts of society, of which some may try to represent future generations of mankind. To determine a sustainable development path in the relationship between agriculture and its natural environment, a profound knowledge of this complex system and its behaviour under different socio-economic conditions is necessary. We present a modelling system which consists of a set of hierarchically linked modules. These modules describe production activities in a way that allows an economic and ecological analysis of these techniques. The heart of the modelling system is a multiple goal linear programming model, which is generated by data base modules. Simulation of single farm models as well as regional models based on simultaneously optimised farm types is possible. The modelling system appears to be a highly flexible tool with respect to the number and type of farms, sites and production techniques. Environmental objectives can easily be included and different levels of goal achievement can be simulated. It is well suited for single farm analysis as well as for regional models, for static as well as dynamic approaches. It allows rapid adoption of the model and rapid calculation of scenarios. Therefore, it is suited for use in interactive environments with users which are interested in repeated runs with little changes in the goal function, prices, subsidies or technical coefficients. The results can be used for policy decisions as well as the strategic planning of individual farmers. Applications of the modelling system will be presented in following papers. In this paper the kind of information the model can generate and the circumstances of their usage are shown. (C) 1999 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

DE Indo-Gangetic plains; rice-wheat systems; irrigation
AB The Indo-Gangetic plains constitute the most important agricultural region in south Asia. From early 1960s to late 1980s, the area under rice-wheat cropping systems in the Indian portion of the plains has grown rapidly and the crop yields have increased resulting in large production gains. The gains were particularly significant in the north-western region covered by the states of Punjab, Haryana, and western Uttar Pradesh although, of late, growth rates have slowed. In comparison productivity levels and growth rates in the eastern region represented by eastern Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and West Bengal have remained low. Water management-related issues pose a major concern to the sustainability of production systems across the region. In the eastern region flooding is widespread, groundwater resources have not been adequately developed and water availability to crops from surface irrigation systems is unreliable and poorly distributed. Over exploitation of groundwater resources and quality degradation are major concerns in sustaining high productivity in the north-western region. Suggestions are made on areas which call for enhanced research efforts. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Greenhouse gas emission abatement: Equitable burden sharing
SO AMBIO
LA English
DT Article
ID STABILIZATION
AB On the political stage the climate change debate used to center primarily around intergenerational issues, particularly whether aggressive abatement action was even warranted-on the basis of uncertain scientific projections. In recent years, influenced by both improved scientific knowledge and greater emphasis on the precautionary principle, within policy circles, climate change has become more widely accepted as a significant threat to ecological sustainability. Accordingly, the focus of debate has gradually shifted to intragenerational concerns, with the issue of equitable burden sharing in terms of greenhouse gas emission abatement emerging as a point of primary contention. This paper integrates scientific and political analyses to explore a number of questions which have been raised during the debate. In particular, we draw on carbon cycle modelling to investigate effective and equitable strategies of emission reduction consistent with stabilization of atmospheric CO2 concentrations at 750 ppmv by 2100.

AB Inventing or sustaining cultural systems and institutions that provide people with an adequate standard of living while preserving forest ecosystems and their biological diversity is a great challenge facing humanity now and in the coming century. This paper describes an effort to use participatory research and environmental education to affect forest preservation by a community in southwestern Ecuador. The sustainability of lowland agriculture in this area is partially dependent on fog-capture by the hill forests. Once the community of Loma Alta understood and valued fog-capture, they used their own system of governance and decision making to preserve the forest. The case study is presented in a theoretical framework of general interest to social and natural scientists concerned with tropical forest preservation. It has particular relevance for integrated conservation and development efforts.

DE north-western hot arid region; agro-ecological zones
AB The north-western hot arid region of India has been classified into four agro-ecological sub-regions, eleven agro-ecological zones and thirty four agro-ecological sub-zones. The sub-regions are based on physiography, rainfall and water resources (surface water through streams, canal and ground water). Within the sub-region, agro-ecological zones have been identified on the basis of land form- soil association, land use and cropping pattern. For recognition of agro-ecological sub-zones, an integrated approach involving land features; soil texture, depth and salinity; Surface and ground water potential has been adopted. The sub-zones are homogeneous with respect to potentials/constraints for rainfed/irrigated agriculture and silvipasture and will require specific technology for sustainable development.

AB A field study on pearl millet and mung bean component densities in intercropping was assessed under three cropping season rainfall situations, viz., above normal (409 mm), normal (301 mm) and below normal (190 mm) having 24, 14 and 8 effective rainy days, respectively. The soil was sandy loam having 10.5 and 2.5% moisture content (w/w) at field capacity and -15 bar tensions, respectively. Decreasing the density of pearl millet (principal crop) from 20 to 13.3 plants m(-2) increased its yield, but further decrease to 10 plants m(-2) decreased the yield at all levels of intercrop component densities irrespective of the type of season. The yield of component crops depended more on the effective storage of moisture in the, soil profile and availability of moisture at reproductive stage (weeks 8-12) rather than quantum of rainfall during the season. Component density combination of 13.3 plants m(-2) of pearl miller with 5 plants m(-2) of mung bean was optimum and resulted in the highest grain yield, LER and WUE in all seasons. Moisture stress in below normal season and the availability of radiation in lower half of the canopy in good rainfall situation was a limiting factor for pearl millet yield. Higher consumptive use (214-254 mm) was recorded in moisture stress free seasons compared to below normal rainfall season (150-157 mm). On an average, harvest index was lower (0.24) in moisture stress season (due to differential influence of terminal drought on grain and total dry matter yield) as compared to normal and above normal rainfall seasons (0.42). High sustainable yield index for pearl miller under optimum component density (0.37) compared to sole cropping (0.23) indicated better stability of pearl miller production due to intercropping in arid environment.

AB Collaboration among key players is a fundamental ingredient in sustainable development efforts. To this end, this article discusses stakeholder theory and its application as a normative planning model, and introduces the relationship/transaction strategy continuum as a tool for applying this theory in development. In this application, planning authorities are directed to identify and proactively consider the transaction vs relationship orientations of key stakeholders. Congruency across this orientation increases the likelihood of collaboration in service delivery. In presenting case instances of tourism efforts, the application of the proposed stakeholder orientation matrix is illustrated. The article concludes with market segmentation strategies designed to promote alignment of the stakeholder orientations. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB While the rhetorics of environment, sustainability and ethics are prominent in academic discussions on tourism planning, they remained somewhat remote in the case of Eritrea. The debate about, how the poorest countries should proceed with tourism remains polarized and confused. To help analyze this, a continuum is proposed upon which various types of planning advice may be placed. The two poles are represented by "Tourism First" (in which developing the industry is the focus of planning) and "Development First" (where planning is framed by national development needs) The terms of reference which are the key planning guide For tourism consulting firms conducting planning, are identified as being particularly inadequate.

AB Many of the controversies about environmental resource use relate to the perceived conflict between economics and conservation. This conflict might have been resolved with general acceptance of the concept of sustainable development, and with a more transparent and honest use of economics terminology. However, interpretation and application of this concept appear to have led to some further conflicts between perceptions of economics and the environment, partly because commerce and development are sometimes portrayed as having the same meaning. Commercial activity resulting from the use of natural resources is often held to promote social good, while conservation of natural resources, many argue, renders the wealth which may be obtained from such resources unavailable. The latter is deemed to be bad for society. However, although in contemporary parlance economics is usually restricted implicitly to issues concerning commerce, finance and profit, economic theory requires the consideration also of intangible values, such as environmental damage. Environmental and other economists have worked hare to stress the importance of non-financial values in economic theory, and to ensure that they are included in economic analysis. However, these latter aspects of economics are not generally known to the wider public, partly because of the tendentious manner in which interested parties often use economics. When positions are argued on the basis of economics, the arguments are frequently expressed in language designed to persuade members of the community that all commercial activity is in the interests of society, while incurring minimal costs. In these circumstances, economics might be viewed as a form of rhetoric. Anyone assessing the merits of such arguments ought to consider carefully what this rhetoric really means. This is especially important in discussions concerning sustainable development, which is understood by some to mean sustainable, or sustained, commerce.

AB Hundreds of thousands of giant snakes (Python reticulatus) are taken from the wild to be killed for their skins each year, raising doubts about the longterm sustainability of this offtake. We visited four locations in northern Sumatra (Medan, Seisuka, Rantauprapat and Cikampak) at four times of year and gathered information on the sizes, sexes, reproductive status and food habits of 784 slaughtered pythons. Pythons in northern Sumatra mature at larger body sizes than do those studied previously in southern Sumatra (Palembang). Their seasonal timing of reproduction is shifted appreciably, presumably because the two areas lie on opposite sides of the equator. The slaughtered animals are mainly adult males and adult plus juvenile females. Females attain larger sizes than males, but very large females are rarely captured. This bias may reflect size-related shifts in habitat selection; smaller snakes (including adult males of all sizes, and recently-matured females) feed primarily on commensal rats and hence are abundant in disturbed (agricultural and village) habitats. Female pythons produce large clutches (mean = 24.2) of large eggs (mass > 250 g), but reproduce only once every 2 to 4 years. The apparent ability of reticulated python populations to withstand high levels of offtake may reflect their demography (rapid growth rates, early maturation, high fecundity), their flexibility in diets and habitat use, and their ability to evade detection (because neither foraging nor thermoregulation require extensive movements).

AB The probability of achieving a sustainable tropical logging operation is increased if the growth of surviving trees is maximized after logging. This research examined the growth ecology of seedlings and trees of the Neotropical timber species, Carapa nicaraguensis (Meliaceae). Shadehouse experiments, field plantings, and growth rare analyses tested the hypothesis that Carapa seedlings and trees experience higher growth rates in high light levels (recently formed logging gaps or logged forest plots) than in low light levels (old logging gaps or undisturbed forest plots). Consistently poor seedling growth rates under lour light conditions suggest that seedlings establishing in newly formed gaps will be more successful than those establishing in building-phase gaps. Thus, the first year after logging is a critical time for gap recolonization by Carapa and seed casting into gaps after logging is recommended. Growth of Carapa trees was significantly faster in logged forest than in undisturbed forest, and was positively associated with light availability. The results provide evidence chat harvest models can be both diameter- and illumination-based Crown illumination was nor significantly higher in logged forest than in undisturbed forest, indicating that the illumination scale for this study was not sensitive enough to detect increases in light availability brought about by selective logging. Potential silvicultural methods (particularly poison-girdling) that maintain adequate forest light levels in Carapa swamps without significantly altering long-term tree diversity or allowing invasion of secondary species should be explored.

AB Changes in the international economy have gradually shifted the basis of industrial competitiveness from static price competition towards dynamic improvement, benefiting firms that are able to create knowledge faster than their competitors. The paper argues that proximity between firms plays an important role in interactive learning processes and that knowledge creation is supported by the institutional embodiment of tacit knowledge useful for particular classes of activity. Sustainable competitiveness requires the ongoing replacement of decrepit resources, the rebuilding of obsolete structures and the renewal of economically important national or regional institutions, when imitation gradually turns localised capabilities into global ubiquities.

AB Forage grasses need to be evaluated in pasture trials in the Great Plains region of North America. The objective of this study was to compare four grass-alfalfa (Medicago saliva L.) mixtures for productivity and persistence when grazed during spring and summer. The grasses were Altai wildrye (Leymus angustus [Trin.] Pilger), intermediate wheatgrass (Elytrigia intermedia [Host] Nevski), meadow bromegrass (Bromus riparius Rehm. syn. B. biebersteinii Roem. & Schult.) and Russian wildrye (Psathyrostachys junceus [Fisch.] Nevski), with grass rows seeded perpendicular to the alfalfa rows. Two sites, 4 km apart, were grazed with yearling beef cattle from 1987 to 1993. Forage yield differed among grass treatments in 4 of 5 years, but differences were inconsistent over time. Five-year mean forage yields and total livestock production were not significantly different among the four grasses. Mean annual forage yields ranged from 800 to 8170 kg ha(-1) and were related to the amount of growing season (April-August) precipitation, Carrying capacity ranged from 35 steer grazing days per hectare in 1992 to 176 in 1991. Grasses in the mixtures did have a significant effect on the grass-alfalfa ratio and on ground cover. Alfalfa content was highest when grown with Altai wildrye and lowest when grown with Russian wildrye. Percentage of ground cover by the grass plus alfalfa increased from an average of 3.8% in 1987 to 16.1% at one site and 31.9% at the second site by 1993. Russian wildrye contained the least alfalfa and weeds after 7 yr. Intermediate wheatgrass and Altai wildrye did not compete with invading weeds at one site, or with alfalfa at the other, and should not be recommended for spring-summer pastures in semiarid regions. Meadow bromegrass maintained a balance of grass and alfalfa and further research should confirm its persistence in semiarid climates.

AB The enrichment with heavy metals of bottom ash from municipal solid waste incinerators limits its sustainable use as a construction material. Part of the heavy metals evaporate during the incineration process. In order to determine the factors influencing the volatility coefficients of the heavy metals, the complex processes in the furnace of an MSW incinerator were simulated in a tubular furnace in batch operation with small quantities of synthetic waste. It was shown that the results obtained from this experimental modeling can be transferred to real systems.

TI Intertemporal accounting of climate change - Harmonizing economic
   efficiency and climate stewardship
SO CLIMATIC CHANGE
LA English
DT Article
ID SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; INTEGRATED ASSESSMENT; CO2
AB Continuing a discussion on the intertemporal accounting of climate-change damages initiated by Nordhaus, Heal and Brown in response to the recent demonstration of Hasselmann et al. that standard exponential discounting applied uniformly to all goods and services invariably leads to a `climate catastrophe' in cost-benefit analyses, it is argued that (1) there exists no economically satisfactory alternative to cost-benefit analysis for the determination of optimal climate protection strategies, and (2) it is essential to allow for the different long-term evolution of climate damage costs relative to mitigation costs in determining the optimal cost-benefit solution. A climate catastrophe can be avoided only if it is assumed that climate damage costs increase significantly in the long term relative to mitigation costs. Cost-benefit analysis is regarded here in the generalized sense of optimizing a social welfare function that incorporates all relevant `quality-of-life' factors, including not only consumption and the value of the environment, but also the ethical values of equitable intertemporal and intrasocietal distribution. Thus, economic efficiency and climate stewardship are not regarded as conflicting goals, but as synonyms for a single encompassing economic optimization exercise.
   The same reasoning applies generally to the problem of sustainable development. To quantify the concept of sustainable development in cost-benefit analyses, the projected time evolution of the future values of natural resources and the environment (judged by the present generation, acting as representative agents of future generations) must be related to the time-evolution of all other relevant quality-of-life factors. Different ethical interpretations of the concept of sustainable development can be readily operationalized by incorporation in a generalized cost-benefit analysis in which the evolution paths of all relevant material and ethical values are explicitly specified.

If examines the interaction between external democracy promotion efforts and domestic structural variables, and concludes that while the international community can induce reform and implant electoral processes in Africa, it cannot force sustainable democratic governance in the absence of capitalist economies, civil societies, and bureaucratic states.

SO DISABILITY & SOCIETY
LA English
DT Article
AB Whilst the Disabled People's Movement has necessarily evolved from a consciousness of disability as central to its participants' identities, and a critique of disablism as endemic to institutional discrimination, academics and activists in various civil rights movements are increasingly perturbed by the personal and political dangers generated by an adherence to 'identity politics' simpliciter. The actual complexities of social life-in particular, the multiple dimensions of identities and the matrices of interlocking discriminations-have propelled us towards a politics of difference. Since a shift of premises and even paradigms is the prerequisite of such a politics, it will inevitably encounter resistance from some sections of our respective movements. This article addresses some aspects of this emerging politics of difference with reference to the self-organised groups in UNISON, the UK's public sector trade union, where the disabled members' group co-exists with groups for women, black people and lesbians and gay men, so that the politics of identity is always already entwined with the politics of difference. Three main themes are pursued-the attempts to transform occasional inter-group collaborations into sustainable inter-group coalitions; the mobilisation of differences across groups in the service of enhancing democracy within groups; and the struggles to accommodate to a burgeoning intra-group diversity.

DE Q methodology; LETS; sustainability; environmental policy; discourses
AB This paper outlines the potential benefit of Q methodology for the study of environmental issues within ecological economics, based on research into LETS (Local Employment and Trading Systems) in the United Kingdom. Q methodology is a qualitative but statistical approach to enable the discovery of a variety of discourses concerning how individuals understand their behaviour, and how they understand the social and environmental worlds in which they live. Q methodology thus has the capacity to allow a more effective form of policy making and implementation process. The paper introduces some of the basic tenets of Q methodology, illustrates these with results drawn from the study mentioned above, and concludes by indicating the potential this methodology holds for ecological economics research.

   between economy and ecology; decision support instruments; valuation of
   nature
AB The trade off between ecology and economy has become an important issue in the evaluation of planned interventions in the Dutch coast. The complexity of the issue is reflected by the long and difficult national debates that these interventions cause. Both public policy makers and private stakeholders seem to be in need of instruments to support the lengthy decision making process. The aim of this article is to discuss what type of instrument is needed to facilitate the decision making process by addressing the following research questions: (1) Can the way in which stakeholders are dealing with nature in practice, be explained by their basic views on nature? (2) Can trends in public policies be explained by these views on nature? The answers to these two questions are obtained by conducting a survey among public and private parties involved in a case study of a planned intervention and a historical review of policies in the field of nature conservation and coastal zone management. The findings are translated into a description of necessary decision support instruments. In order to explain how stakeholders wish to deal with nature in land use plans, a framework of attitudes towards nature, basic views of Conservation, Development and Coevolution, views on nature in the region and design strategies is used. Both the case study and the historical review reveal that the views of Conservation, Development and Coevolution coexist within Dutch society, but a strong tendency towards the Coevolution view can be discerned. According to the Coevolution view, both society and nature are allowed to change and to inflict change upon each other as long as sustainability prospects are enhanced both for society and nature. Though the Coevolution View is very attractive intellectually, it is still in its infancy and the envisaged policies remain quite vulnerable due to a lack of adequate instruments to internalize the value of nature in economic transactions. Though theoretical concepts, such as socio-economic valuation, are available to facilitate the trade off between ecology and economy, these still lack practical applicability. Even if appropriate decision supportive instruments are developed, society is likely to bounce back to a Conservation approach in its actual decision making, as long as there are no institutional and legal arrangements to ensure their use.

TI Consumption, sustainable welfare and human needs - with reference to UK

SO ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
LA English
DT Article
DE consumption; sustainability; human needs; well-being; economic welfare
AB This paper explores the complex relationship between economic consumption and human welfare (or well-being). Conventional economics suggests that increasing levels of economic consumption lead to increasing levels of well-being. However, this view has been criticised on both environmental and social grounds. On the one hand, the material impacts of increasing consumption are environmentally unsustainable. On the other hand, material consumption can conflict with crucial social and psychological components of human welfare. This paper develops a perspective on human welfare which is based on Max-Neef's characterisation of human needs. It discusses the implications of this alternative perspective for the conventional viewpoint and illustrates the importance of it with reference to patterns of consumer expenditure in the UK over the last 40 years. The authors suggest that-from this perspective-modern societies may be seriously adrift in their pursuit of human well-being. However, they also point out that addressing this situation provides far more opportunity for ecologically-sustainable development than is generally recognised. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

DE consumer theory; service use; sustainability policy; mobility
AB The shift from ownership to service use, often promoted in concepts of sustainability, has recently become available in private vehicle mobility. Currently 38 000 people in a number of European cities are participating. This example is used here, to analyze the characteristics of people sharing one 'material' product as well as to investigate which services they actually render. Different views on the latter imply different evaluations of the size of the market potential and different conclusions on the effectiveness of various policy instruments. When service use is a separate lifestyle, policy instruments have to ultimately foster it directly, rather than changing economic costs at the margin only. (C) 1999 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

AB This paper deals with a recurrent theme in the sustainability debate: the necessity of changing Western consumption patterns and 'lifestyles'. Unlike most accounts, in which the principle mechanisms for ensuring this are 'top-down' approaches of government policies, this paper focuses on the 'bottom-up' approaches of citizens seeking to develop less environmentally damaging technologies and ways of living. The paper examines three Scandinavian examples to illustrate how citizens are voluntarily seeking to internalise some of the externalities of everyday life and provide the collective good of improved environmental quality. The paper discusses the importance of social relations in the shaping of people's preferences for environmental goods. The paper draws out what lessons can be learned from these initiatives and focuses on three factors affecting the future growth and proliferation of citizen-led initiatives: upscaling, the transferability of social experiments and the pervasive societal commitments to unsustainable behaviour.

ID GROWTH
AB The neoclassical growth model focuses on factor accumulation as an engine of growth, while the neo-Schumpetarian growth model stresses innovation. This paper argues that these two views of growth may capture different phases of a single growth experience. In the model presented below, the balanced growth path is unstable and the economy achieves sustainable growth through cycles under an empirically plausible condition, perpetually moving back and forth between two phases. One phase is characterized by higher output growth, higher investment, no innovation, and a competitive market structure. The other phase is characterized by lower output growth, lower investment, high innovation, and a more monopolistic market structure. Both investment and innovation are essential in sustaining growth indefinitely, and yet they move in an asynchronized way; only one of them appears to play a dominant role in each phase. The economy grows faster along the cycles than along the (unstable) balanced growth path.

TI Applications of ecosystem health for the sustainability of managed

SO ECOSYSTEM HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
AB A growing body of literature explores the links between the social and ecological dimensions of sustainability. However, much remains to be researched, especially concerning managed ecosystems. Costa Rica has approximately 25% of its area under some conservation regime; many of these protected areas, especially in and near urban areas, are under private ownership and management. Among these is the regime of the protected zones (PZ) that seeks to protect watershed resources. The achievement of conservation objectives in these areas will not only depend on ecological conditions but also on social and economic ones. This framework provides a good field in which to explore the interrelations between sustainability and ecosystem health. This study summarizes the work I participated in the last three years at the Center for Sustainable Development Studies in Costa Rica. We developed a holistic ecosystem health indicator (HEHI) for managed ecosystems. This indicator was tested several times in seven PZs in the east, south, and west sections of the central valley of Costa Rica. The evaluation tool includes measurements of productivity, organization, and resilience of the ecosystems. These were combined with social indicators and resource use patterns from the communities surrounding the PZs studied. The use of this indicator and the conclusions of this project could justify the use of an integral approach to address conservation problems in developing nations. The creation and management of these protected areas should be the result of a combined effort between community organizations and government agencies dealing with land distribution, zoning, and public health, among others.

AB It is at the local/community level that the connections among ecosystem health, the health of human communities, and individual livelihoods are most apparent and critical. This paper reports a number of community initiatives aimed at improving or providing alternative livelihoods, while at the same time conserving or restoring the integrity of the ecosystem on which the community depends. It presents case studies of Zimbabwe's CAMPFIRE (Communal Areas Management Program for Indigenous Resources) and Akwesasne in northeastern North America, as well as examples from northern Canada, of communities that have attempted to integrate economic development, community values/culture, and the restoration of ecosystem and community health. In both the north and the south these communities face ecological pressures such as climate change, industrial pollution, loss of diversity and productivity, deforestation, and resulting loss of traditional livelihood strategies. They are also victims of global economic forces, economic and institutional globalization, and are struggling to make adaptive responses. Common themes are identified across the case studies and we identify the need for indicators and programs that recognize and reinforce the interconnections and guide development programs that integrate community and ecosystem health and sustainability.

AB This study examined the underlying factors that influence household recycling intensity when program conditions (curbside collection) are standardized. A mail-back survey was used to obtain information on public solid waste diversion behaviors, motivations, policy perceptions, and environmental attitudes of 673 households in four communities within the Greater Toronto Area (GTA). Analysis revealed several salient factors that distinguish active recyclers from those with lower levels of material recovery, including individual motivations for recycling, attitudes toward the solid waste problem and strategies to address it, the range of other waste diversion actions adopted, and certain environmental attitudes. The findings suggest potential social marketing and program changes to stimulate household recycling, improvement integral for progress toward promulgated provincial and state solid waste diversion goals.

AB In this paper, we advance a holistic ecological approach based on a three-compartment model. This approach favors policy initiatives that lie at the intersection of the three major areas of concern common to most environmental controversies: environmental protection, provision of basic human needs, and advancing economic welfare. In support of this approach, we propose a "pluralistic stewardship" integrating core elements of anthropocentrism, biocentrism, and ecocentrism. After presenting the basics of our model, we then explain why it is important to identify and promote a holistic ecological approach to sustainability. Here we employ the economic concept of path dependence, emphasizing that there exist multiple paths society can follow in environmental ethics and policy but once one has been chosen, implicitly or explicitly, there may be little opportunity to reverse such choices.

AB The proposed Natural Resources Management Facility (NRMF) seeks to achieve poverty reduction and employment generation through ecologically sustainable, economically viable and people-participatory management of natural resources (resources of waters and soils, coastal and marine resources, ecotourism, energy resources, mineral and other resources). The NRMF will have five functional divisions for technology policy, environmental education, extramural cooperation, technical facility and information network, and international cooperation. At the heart of the NRMF is a state-of-the-art analytical laboratory (with ICP-AES, GC-ECD, CC-MS, etc.) in Maputo. This will be networked with five field stations which will have portable instruments for water, soil, food, etc, analysis. The NRMF will custom-design integrated natural resource management models for different areas of the country, in the context of their particular biophysical and socio-economic environments. Innovative management techniques have been developed to make the NRMF sustainable and largely self-financing. The NRMF will cooperate with, and assist the member countries of SADC (Southern Africa Development Community) in environmental management for mutual benefit, and could, hopefully, serve as a pilot model for the countries of sub-Saharan Africa.

AB Hydrology and ecology are two important factors affecting the rational utilization of limited water resources within the arid inland basins of China. They depend on, are influenced by, and interact with each other. But, the functions and significance of the hydrological ecology vary from upper through intermediate to lower reaches. Abundant rainfall and large runoff in the upper regions favor the vegetation growth, and the bushy vegetation helps conserve water resources. The large-scale reclamation in the intermediate regions leads to many sustainable eases, but with severely changed hydrological conditions and destroyed ecological systems. Human activities result in the degradation of the vegetation and declination of the ecological system at the intermediate and lower regions. It is necessary to establish study approaches to ecological hydrology in arid inland river basins.

AB With a population of 1.5 million and territory covering 581 000 km(2) Botswana's economy still depends mainly on its diamond-mining industry. However, tourism has also been recognised as a potential source of considerable income, with a large portion of the territory now designated as a National Park. Up-to-date knowledge of the land cover has therefore become a priority for its sustainable development. This can be achieved more easily with the help of space remote-sensing techniques, which are particularly suitable for monitoring such a large area.

ID FIXATION; DYNAMICS
AB An experiment was conducted in order to investigate hay yield and nitrogen harvest in binary smooth bromegrass (Bromus inermis Leyss cv. Tohum Islah) mixtures with alfalfa (Medicago sativa L. cv. Kayseri) and red clover (Trifolium pratense L. cv. Tohum Islah) in Erzurum, Turkey for 5 years between 1991 and 1995. The Hay yield, nitrogen harvest, protein concentration and land equivalent ratio (LER) in the mixtures with alternating rows of 1:1, 2:1 and 1:2 of smooth bromegrass with alfalfa and red clover were compared to those in pure legume stands without any N-fertilizer application or pure smooth bromegrass stands that received 0, 50, 100 and 150 kg ha(-1) N. The mixtures had no N fertilization apart from 40 kg N ha(-1) in the establishment year. The dry matter production in all the mixtures receiving no N fertilizer application was higher than in pure legume stands. Pure grass stands were sustained only with the application of 150 kg ha-l N. The highest hay yields were obtained from the mixtures of smooth bromegrass (Sb) with red clover (Rc) (2Rc 1Sb) (14.65 t ha(-1)) and with alfalfa (A) (1A 1 Sb) (14.49 t ha(-1)). Although N application increased Sb yields in pure stands, the highest yields obtained with N fertilization were still lower than the yields in the mixtures without N application. The superiority of the mixtures was also reflected by their large N harvests (e.g. 355.9 kg N ha(-1) in 2Rc 1Sb plots) compared to pure Rc (317.8 kg N ha(-1)), pure A (294.3 kg N ha(-1)) and pure Sb stands that received 150 kg N ha(-1). The nitrogen harvest increased in pure Sb plots as the N doses applied increased. Furthermore, the protein concentration of the hay from the mixtures (158.2-165.7 mg g(-1)) was equal to that of the purl A stands (165.7 mg g(-1)) and higher than that of pure Sb stands (122.9 mg g(-1) at 150 kg N ha(-1) application) although the hay from pure Re plots had the highest protein concentration (179.3 mg g(-1)). The LER values were also higher in the mixtures (e.g. 1.28 in 1A 1Sb and 1.28 in 2Rc 1Sb plots) compared with the pure stands. The mixture plots also had a more balanced temporal distribution of hay. The grass component was more productive in early spring, whereas the legume fractions grew better in the summer. In conclusion, for a sustainable production of high-quality hay and greater N harvests without using N fertilizers, binary mixtures of Sb with A in alternating rows (1A 1Sb) were recommended for long-purpose stands and in alternation with double red clover rows (2Rc 1Sb) for short purpose stands under similar conditions. N application could be eliminated in the grass-legume mixtures without any yield depression. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

ID ROLES
AB The economic reform programs implemented in Central America have failed to meet their stated objectives. Although this failure can be attributed to a number of causes, an analysis of the economy as a gendered structure can help explain it, by looking not only at the impact of structural adjustment programs (SAPs) on women, but also at the impact of gender relations on SAPs. Integrating the productive and the reproductive economies provides a broader perspective from which to analyze the determinants of sustainable economic growth and development. Using empirical evidence, this paper examines both the way in which gender inequalities act as constraints on well-balanced development in the region and at outcomes in terms of the overutilization of women's time and the underutilization of men's time, gender differences in access to infrastructure and gender differences in income distribution. The paper also examines the gender balance in economic decision-making and investigates the tradeoff between the increase in exports and the improvement in food security that has occurred in the region. Finally, some conclusions are drawn.

AB Communication between stakeholders contributes to successful planning and implementation of forest utilization and management practices. A study carried out in 1997 examined communication levels between groups that were, or should have been, involved in forest management decision-making in Cote d'Ivoire. Using a communication framework developed by the authors, data were collected from the following five stakeholder groups: policymakers, forest managers, indigenous people, university officials and wood products manufacturers. Results indicated a lack of significant two-way communication among most stakeholders. However, exceptions were found in the communication between government policymakers and forest managers and, also between policymakers and wood products manufacturers. To promote sustainable forest utilization and management activities, communication gaps among stakeholders must be narrowed and overall communication levels should be increased.

AB This paper addresses the long-term evolving nature of forest management as reflected in Managing Multiple Uses on National Forests, 1905-1995, a new book, and recently published perspectives on Canadian forest management. It elaborates new understandings about the nature of forest management on public lands and proposes a new definition. It identifies forest management as a continuous, unending learning experience, and explains how it has been on the Pathway toward a fully holistic ecological approach from the beginning. It closes on the current dilemma in Canada and the USA - the lack of agreement among the public about the desirable use and management of their forests.

AB Scenario planning was used to develop a consensus-based, multi-stakeholder management planning process for a 114 000 ha land base in New Brunswick, Canada. This is part of the Fundy Model Forest, which involves four major landowner groups, along with 26 other Partnership organizations. Public consultation and Partnership input were used to define 25 scenarios, determining effects of alternative means of riparian strip management, road construction, vegetation and insect control, harvesting, maintenance of biodiversity, and plantation establishment. The Woodstock forest modelling software was used to determine effects of each scenario on timber supply, forest structure, measures of biodiversity and ecological integrity, areas of mature forest, and wildlife habitat. In a series of workshops, the Partners were successful in reaching consensus on a Fundy Model Forest "preferred" management scenario, which was conveyed to the land managers for implementation. Development of the management planning process and the use of scenario planning procedures in the Fundy Model Forest are described.

AB Forests play a vital role in the social, economic, and environmental development of any country. Paper, composed principally of wood fiber, is an essential commodity in promoting literacy, communication, documentation, and packaging. However, there is much concern about the world's forests being over-utilized. This has led to serious repercussions, not only to humanity, but also to the earth's biodiversity as a whole. It is now time that forests be used in a mole responsible and ethical manner. Because of reduced forest area, increasing pulpwood costs, and an increasing demand for pulp and paper products, it might be expected that the focus would shift to high yield pulping processes or to the use of cellulosic non-wood raw materials. Non-woods are available in good supply all over the world, but are currently under-utilized. It is estimated that replacing 5-10% of wood pulp with non-wood pulp would have an important impact on the conservation of forests and the environment. This replacement of wood pulp by non-wood pulp could be environmentally and economically acceptable even in developed countries. By doing so, pulp and paper mills would have a lead role in reducing their dependency on forests for fiber. This determination and commitment would enhance the long-term sustainability of forests and the pulp and paper industry. Above all, it would be a sustainable step towards "our common future."

ID RELIABLE KNOWLEDGE; SABIE RIVER; SCIENCE
AB 1. In trying to operationalize the notion of sustainable ecosystem health, ecologists have focused on identifying sets of indicators which can be used to assess river condition relative to some normative, undegraded condition. Recognition and description of this normative state has proved elusive, particularly in highly variable semiarid ecosystems. Without an operational definition of the desired system condition that reflects both scientific rigour and broader societal value systems, rivers are unlikely to be managed effectively.
   2. Managing river health should not be confused with measuring it. Many monitoring or assessment programs become ends in themselves instead of being the means to achieving specific management goals. The absence of a test of the results of monitoring further introduces the risk of management by observation and 'pseudo-fact'. Health 'endpoints' provide a scientific description of management goals, while 'values' provide a societal perspective. Together they complement the use of indicators and provide the basis for a strategic rather than reactive approach to management.
   3. The integration of value systems, endpoints and indicators of ecosystem health or ecosystem integrity forms the cornerstone of a consultative management process for the rivers of the Kruger National Park.
   4. An objectives hierarchy has been developed to service management's institutional hierarchy. 'Vision' and objectives serve upper levels of management with value based statements of strategic intent which have been tested against public opinion. Goals provide managers on the ground with specific ecological endpoints termed 'thresholds of probable concern' (TPCs). TPCs are described by a range of spatially and temporally bounded indicators of the system's response to the main potential agents of change.
   5. TPCs represent statements or hypotheses of the limits of acceptable change in ecosystem structure, function and composition. They thereby provide an inductive and strategic approach to adaptive management in a data poor situation. Integrated monitoring, research and modelling track criteria relative to TPCs and question whether management action, or recalibration of the TPC, is needed. TPCs thus provide direction for management but their validity and appropriateness are frequently challenged and adaptively modified.
   6. The objectives hierarchy gives Kruger Park management a mandate to 'maintain biodiversity in all its natural facets and fluxes'. Alluviation, as a consequence of increased sediment supply and decreased sediment transport capacity, is a major threat to the biodiversity of the bedrock-controlled rivers which flow through the park. Thus, for example, TPCs for geomorphic diversity reflect permissible ranges of change in bedrock character of the physical template. They are measured as change in the proportion of different geomorphic units in identified representative reaches. TPCs for riparian vegetation are measured as change in population structure of selected species within the representative reaches. They reflect a likely range of biotic responses to change in the physical template. A specific set of indicators, reflecting response to the major agents of change, therefore provides a parsimonious program for assessing ecosystem condition relative to explicit goals and a clearly defined management process.

TI Mana, magic and (post-)modernity: dissenting futures in Aotearoa
SO FUTURES
LA English
DT Article
AB In New Zealand, as in many parts of the world, forms of life, patterns of ownership and control of economic activity, and visions of the future are becoming increasingly aligned with the so-called laws of the market (supply and demand) and with the icons of efficiency and self-interest. The exhortations of ultra-liberal politicians combine with the dictums of the IMF and the World Trade Organisation to facilitate an 'experiment' of the 'open economy', rending up the former British colony to the pluckings of direct overseas investment and free trade. At the same time the nation is engaged in a legislative experiment that defines its future as avowedly bicultural and respectful of the intrinsic value of other parties, present and future, living on this planet. How should we resolve, how should we interpret this antinomy? The paper sets elements of the Baudrillard critique of modernity against fragments of New Zealand poetry (from both colonial and 'post-colonial' periods), in an interrogation of Aotearoa/New Zealand's new resource management texts. Four types of texts are juxtaposed: post-colonial resource management law, post-modern critique, anthropology (and some nostalgia), and post indigenous/colonial poetry. In line with current preoccupations with 'sustainable development', we ask: what is the likely nature of the future, the future of nature, and of human nature, in the land formerly called, Godzone and Aotearoa.(1) (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB The results of recently completed trials in Africa of insecticide-treated bed nets (ITBN) offer new possibilities for malaria control. These experimental trials aimed for high ITBN coverage combined with high re-treatment rates. Whilst necessary to understand protective efficacy, the approaches used to deliver the inter vention provide few indications of what coverage of net re-treatment would be under operational conditions. Varied delivery and financing strategies have been proposed for the sustainable delivery of ITBNs and retreatment programmes. Following the completion of a randomized, controlled trial on the Kenyan coast, a series of suitable delivery strategies were used to continue net re-treatment in the area. The trial adopted a bi-annual, house-to-house re-treatment schedule free of charge using research project staff and resulted in over 95% coverage of nets issued to children. During the year following the trial, sentinel dipping stations were situated throughout the community and household members informed of their position and opening times. This free re-treatment service achieved between 61-67% coverage of nets used by children for three years. In 1997 a social marketing approach, that introduced cost-retrieval, was used to deliver the net retreatment services. The immediate result of this transition was that significantly fewer of the mothers who had used the previous re-treatment services adopted this revised approach and coverage declined to 7%. The future of new delivery services and their financing are discussed in the context of their likely impact upon previously defined protective efficacy and cost-effectiveness estimates.

AB Aerosols from wood combustion originate from two sources: From unburnt carbon and soot as a result of incomplete combustion and from mineral matter which is released as fly ash. Earlier investigations on aerosols from wood combustion were focussing on unburnt pollutants emitted from wood stoves and open fireplaces. Present investigations from well designed and operated automatic wood furnaces show, that a carbon content in the fly ash below 1 wt.-%, to 10 wt.-%. can be achieved. Therefore, unburnt carbon is not the prime source of aerosol emissions in well operated automatic furnaces. The particles generally show a unimodal size distribution with a maximum in the range between 0,05 mu m and 0,2 mu m. More than 80 mass-% of the particles are found in the submicron range. One exception is the combustion of bark where a bimodal size distribution with a second maximum at approximately 5 mu m is found. Cyclones are not able to reduce the submicron particles significantly. The emissions of submicron particles from wood furnaces are much higher compared to gas or light fuel oil combustors. Since automatic wood furnaces use a renewable energy source and hence contribute to the aim of global sustainability, measures of reducing the aerosol emissions should be considered in the future. The present paper gives an introduction to the main aerosol formation pathes and presents recent results from different investigations.

AB Chronic, heavy livestock grazing and concomitant fire suppression have caused the gradual replacement of palatable grass species by less palatable trees and woody shrubs in a rangeland degradation process termed bush encroachment in South Africa. Grazing policymakers and cattle farmers alike have not appreciated the ecological role fire and native browsers play in preventing bush encroachment. Unpredictable droughts are common in South Africa but have deflected too much blame for bush encroachment away from grazing mismanagement. Bush encroachment is widespread on both black and white farms although the contributing socioeconomic, cultural, and political forces differ. Managers at Madikwe Game Reserve have reintroduced fire and native game animals into a formerly overgrazed system in an attempt to remediate bush encroachment, with encouraging preliminary results. A bush control program is needed that educates cattle farmers about the ecological causes of bush encroachment and encourages the use of fire and native browsers as tools for sustainable grazing management.

AB An experiment was conducted on silty clay-loam soils during rainy and winter seasons from 1992 to 1995 to determine the impact of rice (Oryza sativa L.) - based cropping sequence on productivity, profitability, energy and sustainability under temperate environment. Mean rice grain yield of 51.2 and 56.9 q/ha obtained when rice was sequenced with oat (Avena sativa L.) and wheat (Triticum aestivum L. emend. Fiori & Paol.) respectively increased to 62.8, 63.6, 64.8 and 67.4 q/ha by following lentil (Lens culinaris Medikus), fallow, berseem [Cymopsis tetragonoloba (L.) Taubert] and rapeseed respectively. However. highest mean economic returns (Rs 21,869/ha) and benefit : cost ratio (2.27) were obtained from rice-wheat croping sequence, followed by rice-rapeseed and the lowest recorded by rice-oat cropping sequence. Rice-wheat-based cropping sequence also proved most efficient in terms of rice equivalent, production efficiency, land-use efficiency and energy equivalent.

AB A field experiment was conducted during 1987-92 on a silty clay-loam soil to identify appropriate rice (Oryza saliva L.) - based cropping systems with high productivity in mid- to high-altitude temperate zone of Kashmir Valley. Rice, as a base crop, was sequenced with other feasible crops, viz. rapeseed, wheat (Triticum aestivum L. emend. Fiori & Paol.), lentil (Lens culinaris Medikus), oat (Avena sativa L.) and berseem (Trifolium alexandrinum L.). A rice-fallow rotation was also included to represent area where soil is unfit due to waterlogging during winter season. Rice-rapeseed sequence recorded sustainable rice yield on a long-term basis. Rice-wheat sequence secured the highest rice yield equivalent (RYE), net returns and energy output/ha, which was followed by rice-rapeseed sequence. Oat had an adverse impact on rice yield sustainability as it decreased the same by 24%.

TI A robust tuning procedure for adaptive inferential control
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADAPTIVE CONTROL AND SIGNAL PROCESSING
LA English
DT Article
AB Inferential estimation and control are techniques tailored for processes with severe sampling limitations on key process measurements. Often such systems have complex, time-varying dynamics making sustainable control performance an elusive target. As potential solutions, adaptive and robust control have been suggested with varying degrees of success. In this work, robust control principles are used to develop a tuning procedure for an adaptive inferential control algorithm, in order to monitor and optimize control performance. The primary advantage of the technique is that performance-robustness targets are maintained despite changes in system dynamics. A case study is used to demonstrate the utility of the technique highlighting the performance enhancements provided by the combination of adaptive and robust inferential control.

AB Ten years ago the Seychelles Polytechnic initiated a joint teacher-training scheme with Sussex University and in five years trained 100 new Seychellois teachers for the secondary school system. This scheme achieved a numerical balance in favour of Seychellois teachers for the first time. The influx of Seychellois teachers produced a number of immediate advantages: there was a saving in the salary budget, the new teachers were able to supplement their lessons conducted in English with explanations in Kreol, and they also used a wider variety of teaching methods. They were more committed to teaching and were much preferred by the secondary school students. This paper presents findings from evaluations of the scheme. It describes the situation produced by the returnees, and follows this up with an analysis of the major developments since the scheme came to an end and since the four-year government bonding period for teachers ended. The final section of the paper discusses in more general terms the sustainability of education development projects and the implications for the progressive improvement of schemes.

AB This paper explores some of the hidden causes of inequality in the outcomes of development initiatives in the Hunza Valley, Pakistan. A case study of one village, Ganesh, serves to demonstrate that alternative perceptions, attitudes and initiatives which are independent of major organisations may at first sight seem less 'successful'. Issues relating to religion, gender, perception and choice in relation to these alternative views of development are examined. The paper suggests that the small-scale, internally-derived initiatives of Ganesh may in fact be as sustainable as the larger-scale agency related initiatives but that the long-term implications of either are not yet known, It is, therefore, suggested that development initiatives should not only achieve a deeper knowledge of the community they seek to address, but also a flexible approach with alternative options and room for failure is necessary.
