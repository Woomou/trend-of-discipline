AB A longitudinal policy analysis was undertaken in four schools to explore the degree to which positive outcomes associated with a 1990 state policy on education reform had been sustained in the context of subsequent policies emphasizing standards-based reform and school accountability. The shifting policy context supported the sustainability of initial positive outcomes such as increased use of educational support systems and teams, hut was associated with increases in referrals to special education and the use of more restrictive special education placements. Findings suggest a need to recognize shared as well as competing goals among educational policies and to explore a variety of approaches to expanding the capacity of general education to support students within the context of standards-based reform.

AB It is now recognized that Calanus finmarchicus, the dominant copepod zooplankter of the North Atlantic, has most of its biomass in the open ocean. While the Labrador Sea does contain a large population of Calanus finmarchicus, the importance of possible connections with the rest of the North Atlantic are not understood. Although there are few wintertime observations, sufficient data exist to model the role of the circulation, temperature and food supply on population dynamics. This study couples a biological model of Calanus finmarchicus with a physical oceanographic model of the Labrador Sea, using chlorophyll data derived from observations by the satellite-borne SeaWiFS (Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor) as a proxy food supply for the numerical copepods. We produce a large-scale, comprehensive picture of the spatial distribution of Calanus finmarchicus in the Labrador Sea, along with an exploration of the timing of diapause and an examination of population sustainability. We are able to simulate reasonably well the temporal and spatial patterns of Calanus finmarchicus in the Labrador Sea. During a year long model run, the population has a single generation over most of the Labrador Sea, with a final diapausing population about 50% the size of the initial for the parameters used in these simulations. A latitudinally dependent diapause emergence scheme with early emergence to the south of Newfoundland provides the best fit to data. A change of 0.5 degreesC in the temperature field can cause significant changes in the population abundance in a single year, due to changes in Calanus finmarchicus growth rates.

ID GEORGES BANK; MODEL
AB Anchovy recruitment determines fish production and thus the sustainable exploitation of anchovy in the Yellow Sea. Haizhou Bay is a traditional spawning and nursery ground for anchovy. The retention of anchovy in its early life stages appears to be related to observed fronts. Cruises have confirmed that anchovy eggs are distributed in high density patches, particularly in the tidal frontal zone. Front and egg patches shift to the shallow area in the warm season. A diagnostic Hamburg Shelf Ocean Model was applied in the East China Sea and Yellow Sea to simulate the frontal circulation and particle movement, forced by monthly wind speed and measured temperatures. It was observed that the jet along the front and upwelling in the mixed side of the front play an important role in the transport of eggs. Convergence and divergence areas are frequently induced by frontal shear instability and topography potential vorticity balance. Numerical experiments show that tidal mixing and front play an important role to converge particles like eggs. When eggs are caught in the convergence zone they are aggregated into a patch. The convergence zone has good feeding condition for eggs to hatch and larvae to grow.

AB Natural mortality, stock - recruitment relationship and sustainable yield of the anchovy ( Engraulis japonicus) stock in the Yellow Sea were estimated based on acoustic assessments of the wintering anchovy stock from 1987 to 2002. The stock-recruitment relationship was estimated to be: R = 151.1 x SSB x e)(-0.299.SSB), where R is given in billion fish and SSB is in million tons. The optimum sustainable yield of anchovy was estimated at 520 000 tons for the period 1987 - 2002. The ecological consequences of the sharp decline of the anchovy stock observed after 1996 were examined in terms of the reduction in biomass production in the Yellow Sea ecosystem, as well as the consequences of such reduction on predator - prey interactions and species competition.

AB Polyacrilamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) of allozymes was used to investigate the intraspecies genetic variation and the genetic stock structure of Diplodus vulgaris and Lithognathus mormyrus captured from eight localities in the Mediterranean Sea. Twenty-two and 20 putative enzyme-coding loci were examined, respectively, in D. vulgaris and L. mormyrus. Polymorphic loci at the 95% level were used to assess the allozyme variability in D. vulgaris (AAT-2*, EST-1*, GLDH*, PEPB-2*, PGI-2*, PGM*, SDH*) and L. mormyrus (AAT-2*, EST-1*, GLDH*, MDH-2*, PGI-2*, PGM*). The proportion of polymorphic loci in both species ranged from 0.31 (D. vulgaris) to 0.30 (L. mormyrus), and the observed and expected mean heterozygosity varied between 0.082 and 0.093 (D. vulgaris) and between 0.069 and 0.072 (L. mormyrus). The mean value of observed heterozygosity in D. vulgaris showed a deficit of heterozygosites, thereby indicating a Wahlund effect in the samples examined. Significant genetic differentiation (mean value of theta = 0.013, p < 0.005) was found in D. vulgaris indicating an intraspecific genetic substructure among the samples examined, whereas the mean value of 0 = 0.001, p > 0.05 found in L. mormyrus showed a high degree of genetic homogeneity. The results showed the presence of distinct subpopulations of D. vulgaris among the sampled sites, and suggested that analysis of allozymes may provide important information on the genetic stock structure of these two sparids to ensure sustainable management of these species.

AB Bioprocessing will meet its enormous potential towards a sustainable future only if a constructive restructuring is applied in the conventional fermentation industry. One of the most important problems in today's fermentation industry is the processing of raw materials (cereals and sugar crops) that are used for the formulation of fermentation media. An alternative process has been developed that offers low-cost processing of cereals from the initial wheat grain to a nutrient-complete generic bioconversion medium. This paper summarises the modelling studies that have been undertaken in order to simulate the main unit operations (milling, fermentation, enzymatic hydrolysis of wheat flour and fungal cell autolysis) of this process. These studies led to the optimization of each unit operation and provide many useful data for scale-up purposes.

ID CONSOLIDATION
AB Public environmental and natural resource agencies have become increasingly diverse in mission and organization. Although holistic approaches for sustaining the physical attribute of large forest ecosystems have been advocated, attention has yet to focus on complementary organizational landscapes composed of integrated and co-ordinated public agencies. Results of a 2000 assessment of state agency conditions in the USA indicate that state government agencies affecting forest conditions are dispersed over all sectors and levels of state government; a state's lead forestry agency is often only a small piece in the puzzle of state agencies affecting forests; state agencies affecting forests engage primarily in forest resource use and management activities, yet some state agencies affect forest conditions by aggressively implementing responsibility for fisheries and wildlife, water pollutant management, and parks and recreation; consequences of fragmented state agency responsibility for forests are generally adverse, especially public confusion over agency roles and lack of integrated resource management; co-ordination among state agencies affecting forest conditions is modest and takes many forms; and the counterpart to state level agency diversity is the plethora of federal agencies that affect forest conditions, a situation that often deters state ability to integrate management of forests.

AB The participation of local people in projects involving secondary forest resource use in developing countries is examined. Methods and approaches used by research and community development workers for collecting information are revisited. However, the focus is on people-centred methods and approaches relevant for optimising the participation of local people. A case study on secondary forest resource use in rural South Africa is presented. The sustainable use and management of forest resources demand a comprehensive knowledge about the status of the resources through participatory inventory approaches. A hypothesis is tested that the hierarchy of methods and approaches carried out at the household level generate more robust results than communal level approaches for evaluating the availability of secondary forest resources to rural households. Socio-economic factors, institutional arrangements and naturally occurring processes are noted to drive the use of forest resources. The human centred driving forces are better understood through encompassing techniques that capture the knowledge and skill of local people. Such an initiative fulfils the society-nature relationship in the context of the new sustainability science, with challenges that need to be faced with methodological innovations. One of such is the hierarchical valuation scheme that provides the rigour, the confidence and the robustness for assessing and evaluating local resource use as compared to the use of other participatory approaches at communal gatherings. Traditionally, forestry and ecological techniques are used for resource assessments and the prediction of forest resource use. The techniques often neglect local participation, and where local people were integrated, they often provided cheap labour. Traditional ecological inventory techniques are in recent times complemented with methods from social science and development disciplines through participatory learning and action. Participatory rural appraisal is the most commonly used but with its inherent flaw. The importance and use of participatory rural appraisal have been explored and found not to be as robust as previously thought. However, in order to make local participation more liberating and empowering, most weaknesses of participatory rural appraisal have been addressed by the hierarchical valuation scheme. The use of the proposed scheme is explained as a complementary technique for PRA processes, and not providing replacement for any technique. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

DE NTFP; sustainability; biodiversity; community forestry
AB Non timber forest products (NTFP) are emerging globally as a tool for the establishment of sustainable forest communities. They provide employment to various sectors of society, draw on local expertise and culture, and increase the outputs of forests. In recent years, NTFP have received accrued interest by the general public, governments and the private sectors of Canada. However, for the NTFP industry to enter mainstream Canadian industrial culture it is now critical to attempt the integration of the timber industry with the NTFP industry to benefit both sectors. NTFP can be harvested from four types of environment: wild stocks from timber-productive forests, wild stocks from non-timber-productive forests or lands, managed stocks from intensively managed forests, and domesticated stocks from agricultural systems. A large body of evidence suggests that NTFP management and harvest can serve the forest industry in many ways. There are four possible types of interaction between the NTFP and timber industries: independent resource use, competition for resources, complementary resource use and symbiotic resource use. Integration of both industries in a sustainable manner will need to be supported with research that address economic, social, policy and ecological questions.

AB The wider forestry community is struggling to define what the third leg of sustainability-social sustainability-actually means. While work is now underway to develop better social Criteria and Indicators for sustainable forest management in BC and elsewhere, it is already becoming clear that the social process of decision-making and management can be as important to society as the social outcomes. This has significant implications for a results-based system such as certification or a new Forestry Code in BC. This paper explores what a truly open and accountable planning process might look like. The achievement of social sustainability depends in part on society seeing tangible proof that forestry is ecologically sustainable and carefully designed. For many of the local and global publics, the forest landscape itself provides strong evidence of forest manager's performance. The concept of Visible Stewardship, the obvious expression of care and commitment to sustainable forestry, and emerging tools such as computer visualisation of future forests, may be vital to building trust in sustainable forestry.

AB In western Canada, some forestry companies are attempting to incorporate conservation of biodiversity as a new management priority. Here we provide a review of management strategies currently implemented through a survey of companies in this region. Representatives from fourteen companies were asked to complete 30 questions designed to assess six broad issues, all of which are important for integrating biodiversity protection with timber production. Differences in provincial legislation were a major factor contributing to the prioritization of biodiversity objectives. All companies stressed that a variety of stand age classes and compositions was important for maintaining biodiversity. Green tree retention was a common approach proposed by all companies. Definitions of green tree retention varied significantly among companies, ranging from residual material left following standard clearcutting to merchantable trees selected specifically to foster wildlife and biodiversity. Most companies have proposed some monitoring aimed at biodiversity, although most plans target habitat structural features rather than directly monitoring species.

ID SUBSOIL COMPACTION
AB The stress-strain processes in structured unsaturated arable and forest soils depend very much on the internal soil strength and on the existing hydraulic and mechanical boundary conditions. These variables affect soil deformation by compaction and shearing to a great extent. As soon as the internal soil strength, defined as the precompression stress value, is exceeded by external forces, an intense virgin compression process occurs in combination with shearing forces at high pore water pressure values. These processes result in a complete homogenisation of the soil profile down to a certain depth. Consequently, both the hydraulic and the gas fluxes are affected, which results in an intense alteration of ecological and mechanical properties of the site. The consequences of such compaction and shearing on soil strength and on sustainable land use must be considered with respect to the sustainability of the system. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB The past, present, and future contributions of science in the St Elias Mountains, and its relationship with regional development, resource management, and traditional ecological knowledge is examined. Science has evolved from an early foundation of exploration, through stages of resource inventories and surveys, to deductive scientific research and, more recently, a promising reconnection with traditional knowledge. Directly and indirectly, events such as the Klondike Gold Rush, construction of the Alaska Highway, creation of the Arctic Institute of North America's Kluane Lake Research Station, and establishment of protected areas have helped foster scientific activities in the region. In turn, this scientific perspective has influenced regional development by providing detailed information that has been utilized, to varying degrees, in resource use, planning, and decisionmaking. Over the past decade, management of the region has become less sectoral and more cooperative in nature, due partly to the implementation of co-management agreements, regional land use planning, and settlement of first nations' land claims. Incorporating both science and traditional knowledge into this process through collaborative endeavours such as long-term ecological monitoring, adaptive management, and information integration will contribute to ecosystem-based management of the St Elias and ensure that both perspectives play an integral role in sustainable development of the region.

TI ICT and sustainable mobility: From impacts to policy
SO GROWTH AND CHANGE
LA English
DT Article
ID TRAVEL
AB The question "Will using Information and Communication Technology (ICT) systems enable a more sustainable mobility?" is answered through analyzing current ICT policy in the EU and the United States of America (USA), through developing a conceptual model to structure the expected direct and indirect effects of ICT systems on mobility, and through building models for three selected ICT systems to estimate their quantitative effects on mobility. Based on the models, ICT systems seem to have limited mobility reduction potential (in terms of CO(2) emissions and kilometer savings). On the short term, because of efficiency gains, ICT systems have a positive impact. In the long term, better quality of mobility will attract new demand and this will again result in an increase of travel. For policymakers this implies that ICT systems in the short run can make mobility more efficient. In the long run, to prevent the more efficient mobility from attracting new traffic, the implementation of any ICT system should be accompanied by a stronger pricing policy.

AB The importance of urban poverty is increasingly recognized. This paper seeks to learn from the experiences of eight urban poverty reduction programmes to understand how effective development programmes can be instituted. The emerging lessons emphasize the use of three strategies to enhance the asset base of the urban poor: strengthening grassroots organizations, transforming relations with the state and developing new alternatives to conventional urban development practices. The experiences offer insights into strategies to secure poverty reduction within the broad framework of sustainable livelihoods. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The Pittsburgh Regional Healthcare Initiative (PRHI) is an innovative model for health system change based on regionwide shared learning. By linking patient outcomes data with processes of care and sharing that information widely, PRHI supports measurable improvements in regionwide clinical practice and patient safety. In addition, through the redesign of problem solving at the front lines of care, PRHI helps health care organizations to evolve toward becoming sustainable systems of perfect patient care. This paper describes PRHI's design for change, reviews the progress and limitations of the shared learning model, and offers a set of broader policy considerations.

AB This paper examines political feasibility and its implications for health reform. I discuss the political obstacles to health reform in the United States, disentangling perennial barriers from contemporary constraints. I then explore major reform options and their political prospects. I argue that while incremental reform now appears to be the most feasible option, the political climate may change in a way that permits a bolder vision. Moreover, incremental reform may not be sustainable in the long run, for the same reason that makes it politically popular now: It does not change the status quo in the health system.

TI Towards a new welfare state: the social sustainability principle and

SO HEALTH POLICY
LA English
DT Article
DE European welfare states; axiological framework; social sustainability;
   health care strategies
AB In this paper we propose a social and health care model that offers alternatives to three problems arising ill converging European welfare states, particularly in the southern nations: the rise in demand for services and features linked to the ageing process, the increase in dependency and the crisis of informal Support. Development of the principles of social sustainability implies re-formulation of the regulatory, care, economic, administrative, cultural, and axiological framework enabling a response to the needs of long term care Without compromising the welfare of future generations. Together with this principle, quality of life elevated to a Subjective right directs attention towards the sphere closest to citizens, eliminating all barriers, which hamper exercise of this right. All of the above produces economic and social costs which must be accepted from a viewpoint of social co-responsibility, which brings with it the supply of welfare individually, without detriment to the exercise of state responsibility in guaranteeing a social protection system of a universal nature.

ID EMPOWERMENT
AB Since the mid-1980s, the New Zealand health sector has been in a state of continual change. The most radical changes were in the early-1990s, with the creation of an internal market system for public health care delivery. Rural health services, seen to be unviable, were given the option of establishing themselves as 'community trusts', owning and running their own services. Community trusts have since become a feature of rural health care in New Zealand. An expectation was that community trusts would facilitate community participation. This article reports on a study of participation in a rural community health trust. The 'pentagram model' of Rifkin and coworkers, with its five dimensions of participation-needs assessment, leadership, resource mobilization, management and organization-was applied. High levels of participation were found across each of these dimensions. The research revealed additional dimensions that could be added to the framework, including 'sustainability of participation', 'equity in participation' and 'the dynamic socio-political context'. In this regard, it supports recent theoretical work by Laverack (2001) and Laverack and Wallerstein (2001). Finally, the article comments on the future of rural health trusts in the current round of health sector restructuring.

SO HEALTH PROMOTION INTERNATIONAL

ID CHILDHOOD INJURY; HEALTH PROMOTION; PROGRAM; PARTICIPATION; REDUCTION
AB It has been argued that developing community projects is an effective means by which to reduce injury. Two pilot community injury prevention projects (CIPPs) were established in small communities in New Zealand based on the World Health Organization (WHO) Safe Community model. The process and impact of the implementation of these CIPPs was monitored over 3 years. The setting was two small New Zealand communities with populations of <10 000. An external process and impact evaluation was conducted, with data gathered from written documentation, informant interviews and observation. The WHO Safe Community criteria formed the basis of the evaluation framework used. Other essential factors included were identified through the literature and the projects themselves. Findings from each CIPP were considered independently, followed by an examination of the differences observed. The findings from the evaluation of the implementation of these CIPPs are reported in relation to the themes identified in the evaluation framework, namely: community context, ownership and participation, focus and planning, data collection, leadership, management, sustainability and external links. Despite the different contexts, a common conclusion was that if the CIPPs' success was dependent on achieving a meaningful reduction of injury, they were unlikely to succeed. There were, however, a number of strategies and outputs for achieving change that could contribute to increasing safety for the population of interest. These were closely linked to community development strategies and needed greater acknowledgement in the evolution of the CIPPs. Critical to the development of the CIPPs were community capacity and the context in which the projects were operating. These conclusions are likely to apply to other projects in such settings, irrespective of the health outcomes sought.

ID CRISIS
AB This article complements the critique of the development policies and practices implemented in Africa's local communities by African governments and international development agencies by linking them to a specific hegemonic form of knowledge and knowledge production which largely structures the way in which Africans, including African scholars, know development, Africa and the world. They often exclude, marginalize and inferiorize African traditions, knowledges and ways of knowing. With food policy making in Africa as a case, I examine how higher education is implicated in the process by which development knowledges are generated and become dominant in Africa as well as its consequences. Borrowing from critical theory I raise questions about which knowledges are promoted, privileged and become dominant and how. I argue that higher education in Africa should be rethought and restructured to better reflect the actual lived experiences of the vast majority of Africans. This requires that local communities, including their various segments, participate meaningfully in the generation of knowledge about their development to ensure the relevance and acceptance by the people of the policies and programs that these knowledges engender. Institutions of higher learning and research can do this by becoming true centres of critical inquiry into knowledges and ways of knowing, including non-hegemonic knowledges and ways of knowing in the West. They can facilitate this by creating spaces for the expropriation of what is suitable in modern science and technology and their re-articulation with elements of Africa's traditions, values, practices and relationship with nature in order to pursue development policies that are African-centred and sustainable.

AB The commoditization of natural resources in a global economic system and the territorialization practices of nation-states present formidable challenges to the sustainable use of natural resources. Likewise, certain environmental problems such as growth management and residential sprawl have proved intractable to our existing political processes. This case study of grazing and growth conflicts in Arizona demonstrates that intractable environmental problems may actually be emergent properties of complex systems, requiring new political approaches that foster collaboration and knowledge sharing between disputing stakeholders. One such collaboration in Arizona revealed that attempts to remove grazing from Arizona landscapes could actually be to the detriment of biodiversity, contrary to the expectations of grazing critics.

AB Afforestation has been suggested as a means of improving soil and water conservation in north-western China, especially on the Loess Plateau. Understanding of the hydrological responses to afforestation will help us develop sustainable watershed management strategies. A study was conducted during the period of 1956 to 1980 to evaluate runoff responses to afforestation in a watershed on the Loess Plateau with an area of 1.15 km(2), using a paired watershed approach. Deciduous trees, including locust (locusta L.), apricot (praecox L.) and elm (ulmus L.), were planted on about 80% of a treated watershed, while a natural grassland watershed remained unchanged. It was estimated that cumulative runoff yield in the treated watershed was reduced by 32% as a result of afforestation. A significant trend was also observed that shows annual runoff reduction increases with the age of the trees planted. Reduction in monthly runoff occurred mainly from June to September, which was ascribed to greater rainfall and utilization by trees during this period. Afforestation also resulted in reduction in the volume and peak flow of storm runoff events in the treated watershed with greater reduction in peak flow. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB Very high resolution satellite images are used to derive the spatial distributions of landscape ecological metrics within suburban areas. These indicators are weighted mean patch size and lacunarity computed from thresholded normalized difference vegetation index obtained from multispectral IKONOS-2 imagery. Spatial distributions of the metrics are derived for an extensive suburban area on the southwest edge of London, U.K. Weighted mean patch size and lacunarity values have also been investigated in subimages corresponding to different kinds of suburban land cover and with different box sizes. The results indicate typical ranges of the metrics in environmentally sustainable localities. The spatial distributions of the metrics provide new insight into landscape structure, which can be exploited in land use planning and in the construction of empirical spatial planning heuristics for sustainable urban development.

AB A field experiment was conducted during the rainy season of 2000 and 2001 to determine productivity and economic feasibility of sesame (Sesamum indicum L.)-based intercropping system on Gangetic alluvial rainfed upland. All the intercropping systems registered significant and appreciable increase in total productivity in terms of sesame-equivalent yield over sole sesame. Among different intercropping patterns of sesame with pulse and oilseed crops, paired row planted sesame (30/60 cm) +1 row groundnut (Arachis hypogaea L.) resulted in maximum sesame-equivalent yield (1,654 kg/ha), net return (Rs 9,414 kg/ha), land-equivalent ratio (1.59), monetary advantage (Rs 6,751 kg/ha), and indicated a modest aggressivity index (+/-0.29) owing to minimum competition between crops. This system, thus, proved most efficient and sustainable on rainfed upland ecosystem.

AB India has large coastal wetlands which cover an area of over 40,230 km(2). Among various types of marine ecosystems, tidal mudflats, mangroves, estuaries, lagoons, beaches, marshes, vegetated wetlands and coral reefs have a major share. A total of 97 major estuaries, 34 major lagoons, 31 mangroves areas and 5 coral reef areas have been mapped and identified in India for conservation and sustainable use. There are a total of 31 Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) in India, primarily in marine environment, which cover a total area of 6271.2 km(2) with an average size of 202.1 km(2). East coast and Andaman & Nicobar Islands have adequate areas in the MPAs whereas west coast and Lakshadweep Islands have poor representation. Also, another 100 PAs (10 in main Indian coast and 90 island PAs in Andaman & Nicobar) have terrestrial or fresh water ecosystems which constitute boundaries with seawater or partly contain marine environment, but they are not listed as MPAs as per the criteria. Although, India has a very long coastline and varied coastal habitats, contribution of the MPAs is only 4.0 % to the total area of the Protected Areas (PAs) and 1.3 % of the continental shelf area of the country. The common issues and problems that need to be tackled urgently for ensuring an effective management setup of the MPAs of the country are discussed.

AB Cultivation of Gerres oblongus is likely to be profitable because of the consumer demand. The values obtained for the mean weight by sex show that females were significantly (P<0.05) larger than males. Covariance analysis for length-weight relationships of male and female fishes reveals that there was significant variation between male and female fishes (P<0.05). The calculated length-weight relationships of W = 0.01127 x L-2.958 and W = 0.015319 x L-3.126, obtained for males and females respectively. The exponent value, b=2.958 for males and b=3.126 for females, not significant from 3 (P>0.05) reflect an almost isometric growth in both instances. The relative condition of fish showed seasonal variation. The highest median values of average condition factor recorded from 175 to 225 mm total length clearly shows that G. oblongus would be in good condition if harvested at this total length range. Males; generally are in better condition than females. The low relative condition values in February to June indicate female G. oblongus spawn during February to June during which the breeding stock should be protected in order to maintain the sustainable exploitation of this species.

TI Environmental management systems in internacional petroleum industries
SO INTERCIENCIA
LA Spanish
DT Article
AB Petroleum industry worldwide carry out processes that generate direct consequences on the environment, such as atmospheric emissions, liquid effluents and solid hazardous wastes. These industries have begun to minimize the impacts on environment and communities. Among the principal strategies proposed are Systems of Environmental Management (SEM) and their application to improve environmental performance and to achieve economic goals, focused on the search for a sustainable development scheme. Internationally, one of the advantages of controlling pollution problems is the improvement of the company competitiveness and the advantageous marketing of its products. Some of the environmental strategies adopted by several petroleum industries considered as international leaders in the area are revised. It is concluded that only those companies whose management or board is committed to its environmental policies have been able to-implement the proposed systems. It is not enough to take the decision to develop a certifiable system, but it must be assumed as a fundamental part of the business which, under a strict control and constant improvement can become a factor for the improvement of productivity and competitiveness.

TI Effects of sustained harvests on wild populations of Caiman crocodilus

SO INTERCIENCIA
LA English
DT Article
DE Caiman crocodilus crocodilus; harvest; sustainable use
AB Venezuela's commercial use program for Caiman crocodilus crocodilus began in 1983. It allowed the harvest of mature males of total length >1.80m (class IV males) on private lands. Approximately ten million hectares, involving different ecological regions are now included in the program, although not all areas are actually harvested. This study compares harvested and non-harvested populations within the same ecological regions. It was found that both absolute density and relative abundance of class IV males was higher in the harvested populations than in the non-harvested populations, supporting the view that sustainability has been achieved, probably through various compensatory responses of the population to its reduction through harvest of larger males.

TI Impacts of illegality and barriers to legality: a diagnostic analysis of
   illegal logging in Honduras and Nicaragua
SO INTERNATIONAL FORESTRY REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
DE illegal logging; Honduras; Nicaragua; barriers; governance
AB This paper summarises a diagnostic analysis of the illegal timber trade in Nicaragua and Honduras conducted by a team of local and international researchers during 2002.(1) Evidence of the scale and dynamics of illegal logging in both countries, as well as its economic, social, environment and governance impacts are presented. The paper describes how over-complex regulations and market competition from cheap illegal timber reduce the economic viability of operating legally. This particularly affects small-scale producer groups, leaving them vulnerable to economic capture by illegal timber traders. The paper calls for a combination of measures to reduce regulatory "barriers to legality", while tackling corruption and organised crime. Incentives for sustainable forest management, and regional coordination of forest law enforcement and governance in Central America, are also required.

   ALLORECOGNITION; EVOLUTION; SYMBIOLONGICARPUS; SELECTION
AB The colonial marine hydroid, Hydractinia, exhibits four possible outcomes to allogeneic contacts: passive rejection, aggressive rejection, stable fusion and transitory fusion. In the special case of transitory fusion, Hydractinia colonies undergo tissue fusion, followed by tissue death at the original contact area, and colony separation. This type of rejection is different in several aspects from the rejection process that accompanies incompatible encounters. It has been suggested that in transitory fusion, the colonies gain immediate benefits from fusion, mainly due to size increase, without succumbing to costs associated with fusion (germ line parasitism). We report a long-term observation of repeated fusion and separation cycles in clones featuring transitory fusion that revealed a slow-down of specific growth rates following fusion, and recovery in growth rates following separation. Very rapid transfer of stained material between partners in transitory chimeras provides suggestive evidence that protection against germ line parasitism is far from being guaranteed by separation. Our data cast doubt as to whether the benefits considered for transitory fusion are sustainable and support the already made suggestion that fusion with self, rather than fusion with kin, has been the major selective force governing the evolution of allorecognition in colonial invertebrates.

ID COLLABORATION; SAVE
AB Over the last twenty years the international community-realizing that the tragedy of women dying during pregnancy and in childbirth could no longer be tolerated-launched a series of initiatives aimed at making safe motherhood a cornerstone of health services in all countries. Making pregnancy and delivery safe events is particularly complex, as it involves infrastructural and logistic, as well as technical, issues. Women die because they have no access to skilled personnel during pregnancy and at the time of delivery and because-if an emergency situation arises-they cannot reach a facility where emergency obstetric services are available. FIGO, the International Federation of Obstetrics and Gynecology-as the only global organization representing the Obstetricians of the world-decided some time ago that it could not limit its activities to proposing technical guidelines and debating scientific issues. It had to move into the field and, through its affiliated societies, help change the ability of the multitude of women in the developing world to obtain skilled attendance at birth. In 1997, plans were made to launch activities in five areas where maternal mortality was particularly high: Central America (Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and El Salvador), Ethiopia, Mozambique, Pakistan, and Uganda. Five member societies from the developed world (the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologists of Canada, the Italian Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists of the United Kingdom: and the Swedish Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology) agreed to provide support to their counterparts in these five selected areas. The project is now in its final stage. Results are, by and large, positive, demonstrating that, by motivating health professionals in the field and for a relatively modest financial outlay, more efficient use of existing services could be made in a sustainable fashion to save lives.

ID POPULATION-GROWTH
AB The purpose of war is to destroy, and, even with precision bombs and missiles, some collateral damage still occurs. Inevitably, natural capital and other types of capital are destroyed or impaired. In Vietnam, the foliage of forests was targeted. In the Gulf War, Iraq released crude oil into the Red Sea, which damaged marine life, and set Kuwaiti oil fields on fire, which produced both atmospheric and terrestrial damage. War co-opts natural resources (e.g. natural capital), destroys societal infrastructure, and interferes with a variety of natural cycles and ecosystem services. War is incompatible with Sustainable use of the planet since modern technology, including nuclear capabilities, makes war an unsustainable practice. Instead of protecting resources as they become increasingly scarce, these wars (usually poorly masked as terrorist, religious, or cultural conflicts) use natural capital, such as oil, in an attempt to obtain more than would have been possible by peaceful means. The assumption that more will be obtained is weak since sabotage is often difficult to stop. Universal peace and sustainable rise of the planet are both utopian visions, but failure to achieve them deprives posterity of a quality life, and even of life itself.

AB Past decades have witnessed the rise of sustainable agriculture movements throughout the world. In parallel with this international trend, ecological agriculture (with essential goals of food security, rural employment, poverty alleviation, natural resource management and environmental protection) has been advocated as a workable approach for the realization of sustainable agriculture in China. Two decades of ecological agricultural development have shown that it not only gained legitimacy at the senior policy level but also became a focus of scientific research in fields such as ecological economics, ecology, and agricultural and environmental sciences. However, this endeavour is hardly known in the West and little attention has been paid so far to examining the broader politico-economic and socio-cultural contexts within which it has evolved. This paper attempts to provide a general review of the emerging background, development history, policy initiatives and recent tendencies of ecological agriculture. In addition, the extant problems and potential contributions of this alternative practice to China's sustainable agricultural development are discussed. The purpose of this study is to identify the gap between the policy rhetoric and practical implementation of Chinese ecological agriculture and therefore to facilitate its moving towards sustainable development.

AB Since the Brundtland Commission's delineation of the term sustainable development in 1987, virtually every country has incorporated the terms sustainability and sustainable development into their planning vocabulary and criteria for decision-making. However, many issues remain unresolved. Broad and sweeping references to sustainability and sustainable development do not necessarily translate into implementable policies to achieve these goals. In particular, unresolved issues include developing an understanding of how one sector of the economy can contribute to the sustainable development of the economy as a whole and the role of ecological resources in sustainable development. Our paper provides an initial conceptual examination of these questions by folding mining and ecological quality into the sustainability discussion. We use the Brazilian Amazon as an application of our Sustainable development model.

AB Regular physical activity may be a tool in the prevention of sedentary behaviour, overweight, obesity, and obesity-related diseases and plays a fundamental role in health promotion. Moreover, it helps to educate, to develop tolerance and respect for others, to increase interindividual and international exchange, plays a role in social integration, and contributes to an increase in individual sustainable development (ISD).
   ISD is an extension of the concept of the sustainable development (SD). Its aim is to promote a long, healthy and autonomous life, in conformity with the physical and social environment and economic needs. ISD implies individual participation in the decision-making process, self-determination and freedom and/or responsibility in making individual choices.

   analysis framework
AB In Switzerland, communities are encouraged to define and to report on local Agenda 21. This paper presents an analysis framework to help local communities set sustainable development priorities and to follow through with appropriate actions. Four Swiss communities, from the French-speaking part of Switzerland, actively follow the project: Lausanne (114 304 citizens),Vevey (15 364 citizens), Mannens-Grandsivaz (505 citizens) and Essertines/Yverdon (666 citizens).
   The analysis framework developed is constituted of four interdependent fields: the societal characteristics, the individual or collective behaviours, the end objectives or sustainability impacts and the inhabitant's perception of these three fields. The link between society and behaviour can be studied through sociological analyses. The link between behaviour and environmental impact can be established thanks to Life Cycle analysis and Input/Output analyses. At each level, sustainable development indicators can be defined.
   As an application of the framework, the citizen energy consumption has been studied and expressed in energy slaves (= 3150 MJ/Year). A Swiss citizen needs altogether 69 slaves, 20 for his private consumption of goods and services, 19 for housing, 11 for transport, 11 for food and 8 for his consumption of public goods. If one fifth of the inhabitants of Lausanne, wanting to live closer to nature, actually moved out of town, the region would need 10 436 more slaves for 3500 persons happily living in the countryside.

DE urbanization; homestead; environmental agriculture; commercial
   agriculture; Technovation; agro-entrepreneurship; sustainability
AB During the process of urbanization, people are subject to the indiscriminate rise of resources due to competition. The present trend in global population growth predicts that the situation will be aggravated as many people prefer living in towns and cities to resource-poor rural areas. In consequence, limited space, high percentage of ageing population, urban poverty, environmental pollution, changes in urban lifestyles and varied consumption patterns have to be dealt within sustainable development strategies. In this context, urban agriculture can play a vital role by visualizing the urban homestead as a potentially viable production unit of agriculture. In order to live with limited urban infrastructure facilities, environmental conditions and socio-economic situations, the concept of the Family Business Garden Justifies the necessity of its presence through the experience in the Western Province of Sri Lanka. Having a proper mix of environmental and commercial agricultural concerns, the concept paves the way not only to address family food requirements but also to produce for markets under liberalized economies by promoting agro-entrepreneurship and social capital development attempts in urban communities.

ID ZIMBABWE; PLANTS; RESOURCES
AB The role of non-timber forest products in sustaining rural economies of the southern African region has been underestimated because of inadequate policy recognition. As a result, factors affecting the sustainability of these important resources are being undermined. The aim of the paper is to examine trade in two selected NTFPs and implications for sustaining the resource base in Zimbabwe and South Africa. In eastern Zimbabwe, baobab (Adansonia digitata) bark is harvested for craft purposes, but in danger of destruction in the short term as a result of harvesting and trade arrangements. Unless appropriate harvesting and marketing mechanisms including harvesting cycles and adaptive management are adopted, the baobabs and livelihoods of humans will be threatened in the next decade. For wood products from communal woodlands in the South African study, uncontrolled trade poses danger to sustaining the natural woodlands. In both case studies, the role of non-resident NTFP dealers is a source of inevitable threat in promoting sustainable harvesting and trade. Market forces of demand and supply factors are identified as opportunities or threats and presented in a conceptualised framework. Additionally, the NTFP sector management will need to include opportunistic improvement of small-scale agropastoralism.

   case of xenophobia or a real threat to sustainability?
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND WORLD ECOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE harvesting; communal; natural resources; rural-urban linkages; outsiders
AB The harvesting of communal natural resources by 'outsiders' (i.e. harvesters from other villages or towns) was investigated in ten rural villages in South Africa. Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) techniques were used to collect data in focus groups in each village. A case study quantifying the outflow of fuelwood was also conducted in one of the villages. Harvesting by outsiders was reportedly widespread and, in the case of fuelwood, a cause for concern. Of 13 recorded resources, the three most commonly harvested by outsiders were fuelwood, plants for traditional medicine and river sand for brick-making. An increase in harvesting by outsiders over the last decade was widely reported. This was related to socio-economic changes, largely associated with the first democratic elections in 1994. Key socio-economic drivers of this increased harvesting were: 1) the breakdown of institutional control of resources, 2) rising unemployment, and 3) a pervasive sense of entitlement associated with new-found political freedom and democracy. Evidence suggests that the increased harvesting by outsiders is a reality, rather than a xenophobic accusation, and that it poses a threat to the sustainability of communal resources in rural areas. This is discussed within the context of South Africa as a society in transition.

AB Increased awareness of the importance of environmental protection and the introduction of international standards like ISO 14001 stimulated development. of environmental sustainability indicators as a means to measure systems environmental performance. Here, a thermodynamic approach, emergy analysis (Odum, 1988) was used to obtain sustainability indicators able to analyse and quantity the productive and ecological performance of four famous Italian wine productions: Chianti, Brunello di Montalcino, Nobile di Montepulciano, and Barbera d'Asti. The application to agricultural production was motivated by the growing need for productive and environmentally sound development in modern agriculture, in which the resource base, the environment, is preserved. The choice of wines, more precisely, grape production, is due to their importance for Italian agriculture and the economy. All the wines demonstrated a good long-term environmental sustainability, especially in view of their high quality and in comparison with the average Italian wine production. Emergy analysis proved a powerful tool for assessing environmental performance of these systems, and its use could easily be extended to other wine productions to obtain a form of environmental performance classification of this product. Systematic use of emergy analysis to assess environmental performance of different processes and products, not necessarily in agriculture, could be useful for environmental certification.

TI Impact of national consultants on successful expansion of effective
   tuberculosis control in India
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TUBERCULOSIS AND LUNG DISEASE
LA English
DT Article
DE tuberculosis; DOTS; WHO; supervision
AB SETTING: India, during a period of rapid expansion of DOTS services. DOTS expansion has been slow in many countries.
   OBJECTIVE: To document use of consultants to expand DOTS effectively.
   DESIGN: Staff were contracted to monitor DOTS expansion and implementation. To estimate the impact of these staff, we compared areas with and without consultants, and individual areas before and after consultants were assigned. Consultants were preferentially assigned to the more difficult areas; the temporary absence of consultants reflected non-availability of candidates.
   RESULTS: Areas with consultants met pre-defined criteria and began DOTS service delivery faster (median 9 vs. 18 months of preparation) than areas without consultants. Rates of sputum conversion (87% vs. 83%, P < 0.001) and treatment success (83% vs. 78%, P < 0.001) were significantly higher in areas with consultants present.
   CONCLUSION: Assignment of consultants resulted in much more rapid implementation of the DOTS strategy, and better quality performance. Continued effective performance in these areas will rely on many factors, but the need for consultants appears to be decreasing, suggesting that they have provided sustainable improvements. The effectiveness of local consultants may have important implications for efforts to scale up public health interventions for tuberculosis, malaria, AIDS and other diseases in developing countries.

TI City of art as a high culture local system and cultural
   districtualization processes: The cluster of art restoration in Florence
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF URBAN AND REGIONAL RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID ECONOMY; POLICY
AB This article engages in the debate on cultural economics that has recently become more intense in Italy, in order to focus on two particular aspects: the city of art as an autonomous socio-economic unit of analysis, and the hypothesis of its districtualization as a driving force for culture-driven and sustainable economic development. In the article we consider the city of art as a typology of a High Culture local system and we test some hypotheses of cultural districtualization in the art city of Florence. Thus, we concentrate on the 'artistic component' of the productive factor CANH, taking into account only private firms that operate in the field of art restoration and are localized in the Florence city territory. With this as our aim, we undertook an analysis and integration of the questionnaires collected in research by ARTEX (1998) that accounted for 145 firms in the cluster of art restoration. Our analyses brought to light a few interesting signs that evidence the occurrence of different degrees of cultural districtualization.

   Ebro transfer as envisaged in the National Hydrological Plan
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB The present paper outlines the views of the Government of Aragon on the National Hydrological Plan of Spain. It concludes that the transfer of water from the Ebro River will accentuate the differences among some regions of Spain in terms of their development potentials. It will unquestionably constrain the future development of regions that are already disadvantaged, such as Aragon. Alternatives are proposed where the regions in need of water can obtain it, but without adversely affecting the economic, social and environmental sustainability of the region and the people of Aragon.

TI The economic unsustainability of the Spanish National Hydrological Plan
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper analyses the economic aspects of the Ebro water transfer, which have been overlooked in the Spanish National Hydrological Plan. The questions examined are the cost of transferred water, and irrigated agriculture in the Levante and south-eastern regions, which are the main water transfer destinations. Results show that the water transfer is not economically sustainable, because the costs of the diverted water are higher than the current marginal value of water in agriculture, and crop profitability is insufficient to pay for the whole volume of transferred water. A compromise solution between increasing water supply and demand management measures will combine a reasonable water price increase with water desalination in coastal counties. This solution would reduce water demand with a moderate effect on farmers' revenue and net income. Spain could find alternative investment projects to the water transfer, able to improve social welfare.

TI The environmental impact of the Spanish National Hydrological Plan on
   the lower Ebro River and delta
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID BASIN WATER TRANSFER; FRESH-WATER; ECOLOGICAL IMPACTS; CONSERVATION;
   ESTUARY; DAMS; SEA; MANAGEMENT; ECOSYSTEMS; NUTRIENTS
AB The main goal of the Spanish National Hydrological Plan is the implementation of an inter-basin water transfer of a maximum of 1050 hm(3)/year from the lower Ebro River to the north and south Mediterranean coast. The plan also includes an additional list of public works of about 100 new dams and the infrastructure for new irrigation areas, as well as water treatment plants and river canalizations, etc. Taking into accout that the planned Ebro transfer would take 50 m(3)/s during 8 months, and that river flow is mostly in the interval of 150-250 m(3)/s during this period, the abstraction would repesent between one-third and one-fifth of the Ebro flow. This plan, if implemented, would have a strong negative environmental impact on the fluvial ecosystem, as well as on the estuarine and marine ecosystems, but these impacts have not been properly considered in the environmental assessment. This paper principally deals with the environmental effects of the water transfer on the area that supplies the water, downstream from the diversion point. The impact of an inter-basin water transfer on the mouth area is based on three aspects: (1) there is an increase in salinity in the delta and estuary; (2) there is a decrease in the biological productivity, mostly due to the decrease Of nutrient inputs, and there are also changes in the species distribution; and (3) the river carries less sediment, which affects the geomorphology of the system. The possible effects of lower water quality and changes in the fluvial system have also to be considered. The sustainability of deltas can only be guaranteed with the allocation of an appropriate flow regime, which must include not only a liquid flow, but also a solid flow (sediment), given that deltas and coastal systems need sediment inputs (and nutrients) from the river to maintain their structure and dynamics. The classical methods of determining environmental flows in rivers are neither designed nor adequate for the objective of maintaining the deltas and estuaries in a good ecological state. The determination and implementation of an environmental flow regime not only for the river but also for the coastal and marine systems represent a new challenge for scientists and managers.

AB In the mid-1990s, the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) expanded its mission beyond sustainable improvements in productivity and formally incorporated a poverty focus. At the same time it initiated a process for the System to become explicitly output and impact oriented. As a result, social science research has become an integral part of the CGIAR research agenda and the research implementation process. And there is evidence that research in the social and anthropological disciplines is permeating the CGIAR research. However, there is a need for a systematic effort to facilitate the formulation and implementation of an updated social science research agenda that is commensurate with the new CGIAR vision and strategy. This is particularly important in facilitating the true integration of social research into the CGIAR research agenda, a need that has been strongly highlighted by external reviews in recent years. This article emphasises that there is a need to foster a research culture and ethos in the CGIAR that will promote a development-oriented synthesis of socially responsible research that integrates biophysical and human sciences in CGIAR research planning and implementation processes along the research-to-development continuum in agriculture, forestry, and fisheries.

AB Effective management of student behavior begins with viewing each school as a comprehensive system in which teachers, administrators, related service personnel, parents, and students all play a part. In this article, we describe the PAR Comprehensive Behavior Management system, a process-based model in which collaborative teams work together to form consensus on a positive and supportive school-wide approach to behavior management for all children. After presenting the conceptual underpinnings and assumptions of the model, we highlight the content and processes used to introduce and sustain the program. Methods for evaluating the approach and a summary of outcomes from several model demonstration sites are also presented.

ID WATER
AB The governance and management of large-scale irrigation schemes involves the integration of the formal and informal rules and responsibilities of actors at different system spatial scales. To achieve sustainable water management in the irrigated sector an understanding of the interlinkage between these actors is essential. It is to this interlinkage that this paper is focused.
   Drawing on research in environmental and hazard management, this paper explores the usefulness of applying a coercive/cooperative policy design framework to the study of irrigation management in a developing country context. It is argued that such a framework is a useful theoretical construct for exploring the multi-level relationships between governments, irrigation agencies and farmers in the governance and management of large-scale irrigated agriculture. Using the Muda irrigation scheme as a case study, this framework illustrates how an apparent mismatch between coercive governance and cooperative management influences the attainment of key policy objectives.

TI A systemic overview of non-motorized transportation for developing

SO JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION
LA English
DT Article
AB All through the twentieth century transportation planning and the implementation of transportation facilities in the developing world was heavily weighted toward motorized transportation (MT), despite the fact that non-motorized transportation (NMT) constitutes a significant proportion of all trips. However, in the last two decades many researchers and practitioners all across the world have recognized the importance and advantages of NMT, and their investigations and findings have contributed toward identifying, if not mitigating, some of the more glaring problems in these countries. Unfortunately, most of these investigations have been performed in a piece-meal and disjointed fashion. This paper explores the complex and sometimes poorly understood set of relationships between transportation and its links to a myriad of other factors, such as landuse, sustainability, safety, energy, ethical issues, value of time, telecommunication, environmental justice, and equity. The main objective of this paper is to provide a systemic overview of NMT by describing its multi-dimensional aspects and to assist developing countries in formulating an "Agenda for Action".

ID FORM
AB During the last decade, new urbanism and sustainable development have become persuasive concepts in planning rhetoric. Canadian communities have, in many cases, revised policies and plans to incorporate new planning principles to enhance urbanity and sustainability. This paper explores the influence of new urbanism and its overlay of sustainable development in Canadian planning practice. We consider how planners interpret and ally themselves to various models of community design, and whether their policy interventions change the trends in new urban areas. While land use practices respond slightly to shifting paradigms in community planning theory in rapidly growing communities, in slower-growth regions, conventional development strategies reflect political and economic priorities.

AB This paper examines informal networks that support the British Asian(1) business community. Ethnic communities have been crucial to facilitating the economic development of their migrant members, as they make the transition from economic refugees to citizens. The basis of this informal support is the notion of social capital offered to kinsmen who arrived with finite resources. However, as successive generations have become more integrated with the wider community reliance on these resources is forecast to decrease. Research has shown that subsequent Asian generations are developing complex relations in their attitudes and reliance towards their ethnic community (Janjuha-Jivraj and Woods, 2002) it is still an area that is very active in providing crucial informal business support. There is however, a distinct difference in attitudes between first and second generations in terms of accepting business support from the ethnic community. This issue is further compounded by difficulties among external support agencies in penetrating ethnic businesses.
   This leads to the following questions:
   What forms of social capital are evident and how important are they in sustaining relationships within the religious-ethnic community?
   How crucial is the ethnic community in providing an infrastructure to offer support.
   This paper is based on a network of businesses that are members of a sub-group across Greater London. It is anticipated that the findings will help to unravel the impact of migratory bonds on community members. This in turn will provide useful information for service providers when considering how to successfully target ethnic businesses.

AB The purpose was to identify strategies for families to utilize to increase the success of both their business and their family based on analysis of data in the 1997 National Family Business Survey (1997 NFBS). Both the family system and the responses to disruptions had significant effects on gross revenue and owner's perceived success. Reducing family tension, living in a two- or three-generation family, reallocating time from sleep to the business and hiring temporary help during hectic periods increased business revenue. Owners who perceived their businesses as more successful slept less and hired temporary help during hectic periods in the business more than owners who perceived their businesses as less successful. Business assets, age of the business, personnel management, owner's weekly hours in the business, family employees and hiring temporary help were positively associated with increased achievements for both the business and the family. The family had a greater effect on the business than the business had on the family. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

ID MICROBIAL BIOMASS-C; SOIL; FUMIGATION; SYSTEMS
AB An experiment was initiated in 1997 in northeast Alberta at the Syncrude Canada Ltd. Mildred Lake site to field test an innovative technique for reclamation of oil sand mine tailings. This technique was used to create an aggregated soil material from oil sand tailings. A plant community was successfully established on the soil material created by this technique. However, whether the site would be capable of supporting a self-sustainable ecosystem for the long-term remained a challenging issue. We evaluated the capability of these aggregated oil sand tailings by using biological indicators of the abundance and diversity of soil microbial biomass. Soil respiration rates and soil microbial biomass measurements were used to assess the abundance and activities of soil microbial communities. The ability of soil microbial biomass to utilize a diverse range of carbon substrates was used to assess the diversity of soil microbial communities. Soil biological activity increased with increasing growth of plant biomass and over time. Increasing the amount of peat moss or muskeg incorporated into the soil during reclamation resulted in higher organic carbon and nitrogen content and caused an increase in abundance and diversity of soil microbial biomass. These results indicate that measurements of soil respiration and substrate utilization by soil microbial communities may be used as biological indicators for assessing the capability of reclaimed soils.

AB Men have waged an endless and relentless fight against encroachment of the sea upon their land; they even captured some space from the sea. Seldom have they raised the question whether the battle could ever be won. Conquests upon the sea have been admired and heralded as masterpieces of achievements in coastal civil engineering. But were these environmentally wise moves, and were/are they sustainable in our contemporary view of matters and today's scientific knowledge?

AB The coastal zone has been-and is-under siege from several angles for years. The shoreline, in most areas of the world is subject to erosion and regresses. The waters bathing it have been, and continue to be, polluted, mostly anthropogenically, and mainly due to agricultural practices. The coastal zone is, and will be even more intensely, under pressure from a population shift. It is wanted by industry, trade, tourism. These wants and uses are often in conflict with one another, and just as often not sustainable. What can the coastal zone manager and the decision-maker realistically do so that the heritage of mankind be passed on in a tolerable condition? What can be done so that economic development not be stymied and yet such development be sustainable?

DE Black Sea; ecosystem; erosion; minerals; concentration
AB Among the minerals dissolved in seawater some occur in quite high concentrations. Such is for instance the case for salt (NaCl), magnesium (Mg) and bromine (Br), but also for sulphur (S), calcium (Ca), potassium (K), boron (B) and although in lesser quantities-for iodine (I). Salt, magnesium and bromine from marine origin have been exploited on a large scale; salt from times immemorial, the others since numerous decades. In 2000 close to 15 million ton of salt were extracted from the sea, representing 7% of worldwide total salt production. In the same year marine magnesium production amounted to 1.8 million ton or 51% of total magnesium production. Even better, marine bromine production was 380,000 ton or 70% of total world production. But to what extent are those mineral exploitations sustainable and for how long can such operations continue? In view of the industry's demand for these minerals and the very large share of marine origin the question is both pertinent and answers are urgent. The military demands for these minerals, during World War II, contributed largely to the development of "mining" operations while the expansion of the car industry and the need for a no-knock-gasoline spurred the production of bromine. Equally pressing is the question of the impacts such exploitations exert on the environment, both offshore and in the coastal zone. Last but not least, is the use of those minerals not harmful for the environment in general?

ID MANAGEMENT
AB This contribution presents a procedure for sustainability assessment in coastal areas, based on a series of indicators and indices that reflect environmental quality. Three dimensions of environmental quality are taken into account: 'functions', 'interactions' and 'components'. Functions are considered from the 'ecocentric' (naturalness) and 'anthropocentric' (source of resources, sink for wastes, support of activities and provider of services) points of view. Humans-environment interactions are represented by means of pressure, state and response indicators. Environmental components include air, water, biota, soil, geomorphologic characteristics and processes, etc. Numerical indices are used to assess specific dimensions as well as integrated environmental quality. Increases or decreases in index values are assumed to indicate trends towards greater or lesser sustainability of existing practices. The procedure proposed has been developed within the ELANEM Euro-Latin American project (INCO Programme, European Commission). The methodological framework, indicators and criteria used for the assessment are explained. Results obtained on several study areas of Spain, Mexico and Argentina are presented and discussed.

AB The subtropical Atlantic coastal zone of southeastern Florida supports nearly 7 million inhabitants on a coastal plain conurbation that stretches from West Palm Beach to Miami. About a quarter of the present population originally settled on higher topography along the shore-parallel Atlantic Coastal Ridge. From about the middle 1900s, however, urbanization intensified along the shore and spread westward into freshwater marshlands. Population densities approaching 2500 persons per km(-2) along some coastal sectors and dredge and fill operations to create urban land in western marshes degraded coastal environments bringing in question sustainability. Efforts to maintain environmental integrity initially focused on shore protection first via "hard" engineering works, which later ont included massive beach renourishment projects along developed coasts subject to critical erosion. Marine algal blooms, led to eutrophication, degraded coastal water quality, and deterioration of coral reefs indicate environmental problems at least as serious as beach erosion. Recognition of a potential eco-catastrophe, collapse of entire marine and coastal wetland ecosystems in southern Florida, led turn to the Everglades Restoration Project, the largest single environmental recovery effort in the world. Cleanup of terrestrial systems is essential to sustainability of marine ecosystems now jeopardized by nutrient loading.
   Serious degradation of the Florida Reef Tract, a coral-algal barrier reef system, is beyond question as extensive sectors of coral reef die from increased loading of nearshore waters by elevated nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) nutrient levels delivered to the coast by submarine groundwater discharge (SGD). The source of N-P input into the Biscayne Aquifer, which has one of the highest carbonate aquifer transmissivities in the world, is sugar cane farming in the Everglades Agricultural Area on the inner portion of the coastal plain. Groundwater discharges for Palm Beach County are, for example, estimated from a groundwater MODFLOW model at 1,659 X 10(6) m(3) yr(-1). Total N in groundwater below the coastal plain adjacent to remnant Everglades averages about 1.25 mg l(-1). SGD nutrient fluxes to the coast are 5727 and 414 metric tons per year for P and N, respectively. Surface water contributions for P and N are respectively 197 and 2,471 metric tons per year. Nutrient delivery to beach and nearshore environments is a serious problem that threatens coastal water quality which in turn will impact tourism-related activities such as sunbathing, beach walking, swimming, snorkeling, SCUBA diving, and surf fishing. The full magnitude of the problem has yet to surface because it takes about three to eight decades for groundwater from the interior parts of the coastal plain to reach the nearshore zone. Pollution of groundwater increases with time due to higher doses of fertilizers on croplands and runoff from expanding urban areas.
   Solutions to present environmental threats are obvious and, perhaps surprisingly, do not fall within the scientific arena because causes and remedies are already known and future impacts are anticipated. The present environmental cleanup efforts, which are of mammoth proportions and financial cost, are doomed to failure until the causes of problems are eliminated or neutralized. Even though sustainable management procedures are well known, sustainability cannot be achieved by treating symptoms. Sustainable coastal habitats in subtropical southeast Florida will be secured when there is application of best management practices based on environmental ethics rather than capital gain, development of political will directed towards continuous multiple land use rather than terminal single use, and inculcation of proactive public perception of best land management practices rather than politically-correct land-use policies.

AB A need exists for a legal formulation of "crimes" against the environment. There is a similar need for a juridical body to ensure the respects of laws, rules and directives aimed at protecting the environment and ensuring that development be sustainable: Several existing courts could be entrusted with cases flowing forth of such enforcement; however all of them appear to have impediments which would curb their efficiency or limit the accessibility to certain parties, thus disenfranchising some. The International Court of the Environment Foundation has; since several decades encouraged the establishment of a separate body and fostered the worldwide acceptance of the concept at international conferences. While its jurisdiction would embraces all regions, there is little doubt that it would be instrumental in favoring effective sustainable development in such coastal regions as for instance the Black Sea area.

AB Nature protection organizations have apparently succeeded in focusing the attention of political and governing authorities which, finally, show a sustained attention for the coastal zones sustainable development. Attention stretches now beyond the now traditional concerns for the shoreline inland migration and the retreat of the coastal cliffs, and the loss of biodiversity. Today care encompasses similarly human occupance, user conflicts, fisheries and mining. These organizations go beyond academe et non-governmental cadres, such as one of the very sponsors of this seminar-the Malta-based International Ocean Institute-to encompass as well "big guns" among decision-makers, members of the political and cultural communities, and the quite influential UNESCO. Sustainability will be achieved through sustained communication, rather than through authorities' authoritarian fiats.

AB The coastline between Portixeddu and Buggerru (SW-Sardinia) is characterised by a succession of beaches, dunes, rocky coasts and cliffs, generally in a natural state with few human settlements. The main economic activities in this area were related to metal deposits, hosted in Cambrian carbonate rocks and exploited for more than a century until the early 1970's. Since the closure of the mines future economical development has been focussed on beach resorts and cultural tourism.
   This coastal area has been chosen as a test site for the geoenvironmental analysis aiming to outline the naturalistic and cultural potential and the carrying capacity for a sustainable tourist development, obtainable through a careful and respectful planning in such sensible and delicate environments. Geological and geomorphological mapping, beach evolution monitoring, sedimentological analysis of beach and dune sands and a systematic campaign of vegetation and land-use mapping have been set out. The carrying capacity of the slowly eroding beach has been calculated taking in consideration its geoenvironmental characteristics (sensibility, vulnerability etc.) and is proportional to its surface. Thanks to the elaboration of all this information it has been possible to plan the tourist development of this area, respecting both the natural equilibrium of the beach, the coastline and the entire area, and the local needs of social and economical development.

AB We consider an economy with a consumer good, capital, a natural resource that provides amenity values, and heterogeneous overlapping generations. We compare a benchmark grandfathering policy that ensures efficiency through privatization with a policy of enforced resource conservation. It is shown that (i) conservationist measures do not cause any Pareto inefficiency, irrespective of whether they pass a cost-benefit test. Moreover, it is shown that (ii) there exist Pareto optimal allocations that can only be reached through resource conservation, and not through competitive markets, irrespective of compensating income transfers. Finally, (iii) equivalence is demonstrated between strict resource conservation and non-dictatorship of the present generations over future generations as formalized in Chichilnisky's 'sustainable welfare function'. The results are shown to hold in both a first-best and a second-best setting. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.

AB The suitability of a new pilot-scale reactor to recover phosphorus through struvite crystallization was examined. Based on the similar principles previously tested in bench-scale reactors and scaled up to overcome operating problems encountered in earlier work, the pilot-scale crystallizer was used to effectively remove-recover phosphorus from synthetic wastewaters. Ortho-P removal rates as high as 90% were obtained for low (similar to50-70 mg/L P) and medium (similar to70-100 mg/L P) strength wastewaters. To achieve these removal rates, a relatively high pH value of 8.3 was required. Over 90% of the removed phosphates could be recovered in the form of harvestable struvite crystals with a mean size of 2.5-3.5 mm and sufficient mechanical strength to permit harvesting-reuse. A new concept of crystal retention time (CRT) has been developed, which is used to make estimates of the struvite crystal age. Results of this study indicate that CRT is one of the main factors affecting the mean crystal size.

AB Among the many factors that contribute to overexploitation of marine fisheries, the role played by uncertainty is important. This uncertainty includes both the scientific uncertainties related to the resource dynamics or assessments and the uncontrollability of catches. Some recent works advocate for the use of marine reserves as a central element of future stock management. In the present paper, we study the influence of protected areas upon fisheries sustainability through a simple dynamic model integrating non-stochastic harvesting uncertainty and a constraint of safe minimum biomass level. Using the mathematical concept of invariance kernel in a robust and worst-case context, we examine through a formal modeling analysis how marine reserves might guarantee viable fisheries. We also show how sustainability requirement is not necessarily conflicting with optimization of catches. Numerical simulations are provided to illustrate the main findings. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In the 1990s a wide array of non-governmental certification initiatives emerged as a way to promote the sustainable management of resources in sectors such as fisheries and forestry. in this paper, we examine two related questions about these initiatives: how does the institutional design of certification initiatives affect the way science is used in the development of certification standards and in whose interest is science employed? Using the empirical case of forest certification and the specific standards various initiatives have created to address the management of forest genetic resources, we show how structural aspects of decision-making processes affects the standards adopted and the rationalization for their appropriateness. Two basic models of decision-making-stakeholder participation and technical expertise-are discussed in relation to three certification initiatives active in North America-the Canadian Standards Association, the Sustainable Forestry Initiative and the Forest Stewardship Council. By examining the standards these initiatives set for the management of forest genetic resources, we illustrate how two dimensions of science-uncertainty and the logic of cause and effect-are used to rationalize cautious and rigid versus flexible and discretionary standards for the management of forest genetic resources. Our findings indicate that the design or structure of certification decision-making processes, and their embedded balance of authority, mediate the form of standards initiatives will justify on the basis of science.

   INTENTION
AB This paper contributes empirical input to current reasoning about consumers' propensity to behave in an environment-friendly way in different domains. Specifically, we investigate whether environmental-friendly behaviours spread to more and more areas of the consumption pattern in a virtuous circle and whether it is a necessary prerequisite for a virtuous circle to emerge and to continue to work that the individual possesses certain general values or ethical norms. The data material is a three-wave panel study with a large random sample of Danish consumers. The data were analysed by means of structural equation modelling and other techniques. Cases of transfer of environment-friendly conduct between behavioural categories are found, but only in a few of the possible instances and only of a modest size. The panel analysis also identifies a few negative cross-lagged effects. Such effects may indicate that the performance of an environment-friendly behaviour reduces the propensity to behave environmentally friendly in other areas. However, they may also be the result of the two involved behaviours correlating positively from the outset. Multigroup SEM analyses indicate that the likelihood of spillover is marginally but significantly higher when respondents give high priority to the value domain that Shalom H. Schwartz termed universalism or hold strong personal norms for environment-friendly behaviour. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Redefining social and environmental relations at the ecovillage at
   Ithaca: A case study
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB The goal of the recently constructed ecovillage at Ithaca (EVI) is to create a "socially harmonious, economically viable and ecologically sustainable settlement that will demonstrate that human beings can live cooperatively with each other and with the natural environment." (EVI Housing Cooperative, undated) This paper examines the blend of social vision and personal factors that brought the 30 households together to realize this project. Interviews were conducted with residents that explored their initial motivations in becoming involved with the project, and solicited their impressions of the first 5 years of the ecovillage's existence. The interplay of personal and ideological factors emerges, revealing an implicit and explicit critique of the existing social mode, as residents seek reconnection with each other and with the natural environment. This paper explores the nature of the community that has been created, socially, spatially and imaginatively. In so doing, it reveals the challenges, rewards and disappointments that residents have experienced in realizing their vision. The various ways that residents seek to connect with the world are enumerated, and these are proposed as the dimensions that constitute a sustainable lifestyle. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Severe acute respiratory syndrome: a challenge for public health
   practice in Hong Kong
SO JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY AND COMMUNITY HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
ID GLOBALIZATION
AB Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is now a global challenge affecting more than 8000 patients in different continents. The dictum of public health practice especially for infectious disease is "prevention better than cure". It is especially true for SARS as the treatment strategies remain diverse and experimental. Maintaining a healthy and hygienic environment can be one of the effective public health measures to combat infectious disease. The major challenge is that some of the most important public health measures are to be taken outside the health sector. The community also needs to be strengthened and equipped with the health skills to promote better health and hygiene. There is also the need to create a supportive environment conducive to health for long term sustainability. The WHO approach of promoting health through setting approach would be one possible solution to face the challenge. This paper will describe some of the public health initiatives in Hong Kong through "setting approach" and "community development model" in helping the society fight against SARS. With the emergence of SARS, this might be the time to globalise public health medicine as an important component of medical practice.

AB We present here an inventory of the medicinal plants of Bulamogi county in Uganda, including their medicinal use, preparation and administration modes. Fieldwork for this study was conducted between June 2000 and June 2001 using semi-structured interviews, questionnaires, and participant observation as well as transect walks in wild herbal plant collection areas. We recorded 229 plant species belonging to 168 genera in 68 families with medicinal properties. A large proportion of these plants are herbaceous. The medicinal plants are mainly collected from the wild. Some species, such as Sarcocephalus latifolius (Smith) Bruce, are believed by the community to be threatened by unsustainable intensities of use and patterns of harvesting. Particularly vulnerable are said to be the woody or the slow growing species. Herbal medicines are prepared as decoctions, infusions, powders, or as ash, and are administered in a variety of ways. Other concoctions consist of juices and saps. The purported therapeutic claims await validation. Validation in our opinion can help to promote confidence among users of traditional medicine, and also to create opportunities for the marketing of herbal medicines and generate incomes for the community. The processing, packaging and storage of herbal medicines is substandard and require improvement. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID LAND-COVER
AB Parcelization, the process by which relatively large forest ownerships become subdivided into smaller ones, is often related to changes in ownership and can bring changes to the use of the land. Landowners, resource professionals, and others interested in Wisconsin's Northwoods were asked their views on parcelization in a series of stakeholder forums. We analyzed their statements through the lens of forest sustainability with its ecological, economic, and social dimensions. The analysis shows how sustainability might be used to structure future research and discourse within local communities to foster fuller considerations of landscape and land use change.

AB The paucity of adequately educated leaders hampers programs in international forestry and sustainable development, where an ability to function effectively across cultures and disciplines is a prerequisite for success. With support from the National Science Foundation, the University of Florida is launching a graduate education and research program focused on neotropical working forests. The program offers an interdisciplinary curriculum to train doctoral students to research the tradeoffs and complementarities among working forest options, the effectiveness of different kinds of working forests for conservation and development, and efforts to promote forest management and conservation in neotropical regions. Increasing the ability of both the University of Florida and participating Latin American institutions to conduct truly collaborative, interdisciplinary research and training is an explicit program goal.

AB This paper presents a framework to explore the relationship between health equity and community empowerment. It traces the progression of the concept of participation to the present term of empowerment and the links among empowerment, equity, and health outcomes. It argues that the relationship can best be described by using the acronym CHOICE (Capacity-building, Human rights, Organizational sustainability, Institutional accountability, Contribution, and Enabling environment). Based on the concept of development as freedom put forward by Nobel Laureate Amartya Sen, the paper describes how each factor illustrates the relationship between equity and empowerment in positive health outcomes, giving appropriate examples. In conclusion, it is suggested that these factors might form the basis of a tool to assess the relationship between equity and empowerment and its impact on health outcomes.

AB The paper traces the evolution and working of the Global Equity Gauge Alliance (GEGA) and its efforts to promote health equity. GEGA places health equity squarely within a larger framework of social justice, linking findings on socioeconomic and health inequalities with differentials in power, wealth, and prestige in society. The Alliance's 11 country-level partners, called Equity Gauges, share a common action-based vision and framework called the Equity Gauge Strategy. An Equity Gauge seeks to reduce health inequities through three broad spheres of action, referred to as the 'pillars' of the Equity Gauge Strategy, which define a set of interconnected and overlapping actions. Measuring and tracking the inequalities and interpreting their ethical import are pursued through the Assessment and Monitoring pillar. This information provides an evidence base that can be used in strategic ways for influencing policy-makers through actions in the Advocacy pillar and for supporting grassroots groups and civil society through actions in the Community Empowerment pillar. The paper provides examples of strategies for promoting pro-equity policy and social change and reviews experiences and lessons, both in terms of technical success of interventions and in relation to the conceptual development and refinement of the Equity Gauge Strategy and overall direction of the Alliance. To become most effective in furthering health equity at both national and global levels, the Alliance must now reach out to and involve a wider range of organizations, groups, and actors at both national and international levels. Sustainability of this promising experiment depends, in part, on adequate resources but also on the ability to attract and develop talented leadership.

TI Tacit collusion in repeated auctions: Uniform versus discriminatory
SO JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ECONOMICS
LA English
DT Article
ID PRICE-SETTING SUPERGAMES; CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS; TREASURY AUCTIONS
AB Within an infinitely repeated game, I compare the level and conduct of collusion under uniform and discriminatory auctions. For this purpose, I characterize the optimal collusive schemes and sets of sustainable profits under these auction formats. I show that uniform auctions facilitate collusion more than discriminatory auctions: the optimal penal code is equally severe under the two formats; but bidders' deviation incentives are weaker in uniform auctions given that the payoff irrelevant bids can be used to relax the enforcement problem. This discussion is particularly relevant after the recent reforms in the electricity industry in England & Wales, and elsewhere.

AB The past few years have seen an explosion in the number of e-marketplaces, including a variety of electronic exchanges in the B2B arena, but many of these have also collapsed (e.g., ChemdexNentro). The question addressed in this paper is what are the underlying factors that affect which transactions are likely to be supportable by B2B exchanges. In particular, we identify and study three factors: supplier management, idiosyncratic investments in information systems, and codifiability (i.e., digitalizability) of product and order-fulfillment specifications underlying transactions. We show that transaction codifiability plays a fundamental role in influencing the nature of sustainable contracting and IT investments in e-markets. Hypotheses are derived from an analytical model of codifiability in e-marketplaces; these hypotheses are supported by several case studies by the authors and others on the key success factors underlying B2B exchanges.

AB Iodine deficiency has major health consequences for the fetus and infant. Most individuals can tolerate fairly high intakes of iodine without problems. The Western Hemisphere has made great progress towards correcting its iodine deficiency, but pockets of deficiency remain and fragile monitoring systems endanger sustainability. Because the consequences of iodine deficiency are severe and the risks of excess treatment with modest supplements are minimal, we recommend the regular addition of 90 mug of iodine daily to complementary foods for children and 150 mug for pregnant or lactating women, accompanied by effective monitoring of urinary iodine concentration in the population.

AB Octopamine is proposed as a substitution product of synephrine by diverse drug industries that advertise new weight-lowering products or medicinal plants enriched ill this biogenic airline. We have already reported that octopamine is able to activate in vitro lipolysis in rat adipocytes Via beta(3)-adrenergic receptor activation, while it activates glucose uptake in human fat cells via its oxidation by amine oxidases. In this work, we tested whether a chronic challenge with octopamine could exert anti-obesity effects. A treatment consisting in daily i.p. administration of octopamine (81 mumol/kg) was compared on a four-week period with caloric restriction in the genetically obese Zucker rat. Octopamine treatment resulted in a 19 % decrease in body weight gain, when compared to the 177 g gained by controls during the same period. The decrease in body weight gain was detectable only after three weeks of treatment and was apparently not due to a pronounced and sustainable anorectic effect of octopamine since: 1) cumulated food consumption was only reduced by 10 %; 2) the experimental 18 % reduction of food intake provoked a rapid decrease in body weight gain, significant in less than two weeks. The lipolytic responses to isoprenaline or octopamine and the stimulation of glucose transport by insulin or by the airline oxidase substrate tyramine were unmodified by the treatments. Noteworthy, the elevated plasma insulin of obese rats was lowered by octopamine. This stud), shows that octopamine call reduce body weight gain in obese rats, without apparent adverse effects, but with less efficacy than beta(3)-AR agonists.

AB A two-dimensional mixed compression inlet model with a subsequent isolator section is tested under Mach 4 and 5 flight conditions. Different configurations of the isolator are assessed with respect to their compression efficiency. The experimental investigations yield schlieren pictures of the isolator flow and static surface pressure measurements. The numerical simulations are performed with a Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes solver using a k-omega turbulence model, especially,extended for modeling high-speed wall-bounded flows and separation regions. The close collaboration of experiment and simulation is beneficial: Validation of the simulation is achieved by the test data and the flowfield information available in the computational fluid dynamics results is employed to interpret the experimental findings and to compute the performance parameters. The computed static pressure ratios are in excellent agreement with empirical predictions. Furthermore, the investigations show that increasing the isolator length reduces the pressure sensitivity of the inlet. However, the experimental tests show that above a certain isolator length, no further increase of the sustainable backpressure is possible.

TI Greening development to protect watersheds - Does new urbanism make a
   difference?
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN PLANNING ASSOCIATION
LA English
DT Article
AB New urbanism has been touted as a more environmentally sustainable form of development than conventional low-density sprawl. To test this assertion, this study comparatively evaluates how well 50 matched pairs of new urban and conventional developments in the United States integrate watershed protection techniques. Findings indicate that new urban development practices offer a greener and more compact alternative to sprawl in greenfields on the suburban fringe, as they are more likely to protect and restore sensitive areas, reduce impervious cover, and incorporate best management practices. New urban developments in infill sites are more likely to incorporate impervious surface reduction techniques and restore degraded stream environments, but have equivalent levels of sensitive area protection and use of best management practices. Recommendations offer ways in which watershed protection techniques can be used to implement more environmentally sustainable development.

   object-oriented programming; system dynamics model
ID CATCHMENT
AB The current land use management framework considers economic, social, and environmental influences individually, making it difficult to achieve sustainable development. Therefore, this study aims to develop a system dynamics model to help decision makers to integrally and systematically consider the components and interactions in land use management. Based on the concept of sustainable development, this study uses systems thinking to develop dynamics of sustainable land use management in a river basin, which considers human activities, land resources, water resources, and air resources integrally. Furthermore, this study uses the concept of driving force-state-response to establish a conceptual dynamics framework for sustainable land use management. Because of the complicated interactions among the above components and iterative decision-making procedures, this study uses Vensim software and the concept of object-oriented programming to develop a sustainable land use management system dynamics model (SLUMSD model) based on the conceptual dynamics framework. The Nankan river basin is used as a case study to illustrate the capability of the SLUMSD model. The case study indicates that the interactions among the components in sustainable land use management can be effectively identified in the SLUMSD model. While planning strategies for sustainable land use management, decision-makers can use the SLUMSD model to understand how the components vary with different alternatives. Using the SLUMSD model to iteratively modify alternatives can ensure appropriate decision-making in sustainable land use management.

AB Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is linked to the development of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), a vascular spindle cell tumor primarily consisting of proliferating endothelial cells. Although KSHV has been shown to infect primary human endothelial cells and convert them into spindle shapes, KSHV infection is largely latent, and efforts to establish a highly efficient and sustainable infection system have been unsuccessful. A recombinant KSHV, BAC36, that has high primary-infection efficiency in 293 cells has been obtained (F. C. Zhou, Y. J. Zhang, J. H. Deng, X. P. Wang, H. Y. Pan, E. Hettler, and S. J. Gao, J. Virol. 76:6185-6196, 2002). BAC36 contains a green fluorescent protein cassette which can be used to conveniently monitor viral infection. Here, we describe the establishment of a KSHV lytic-replication-permissive infection cell model using BAC36 virions to infect primary human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) cultures. BAC36 infection of HUVEC cultures has as high as 90% primary-infection efficiency and consists of two phases: a permissive phase, in which the cultures undergo active viral lytic replication, producing a large number of virions and concomitantly resulting in large-scale cell death, and a latent phase, in which the surviving cells from the permissive phase switch into latent infection, with a small number of cells undergoing spontaneous viral lytic replication, and proliferate into bundles of spindle cells with KS slit-like spaces. An assay for determining the KSHV titer in a virus preparation has also been developed. The cell model should be useful for examining KSHV infection and replication, as well as for understanding the development of KS.

DE Korea's e-learning; e-learning; cyberspace; paradigm shift; lifelong
   learning; learner-regulated learning
AB As information and communication technology becomes increasingly an integral part of society, and as Koreans grow more dependent on information, the demand is growing not only for high-quality education but also for more sustainable and accessible lifelong teaming. In South Korea, the demand for e-leaming is growing as a methodology to meet such a demand. Its technological infrastructure, ranked with the world's most advanced nations, along with strong government support for e-learning related policies, both provide the necessary conditions for the proliferation and success of e-leaming in Korea. To guarantee success for the next generation of e-learning in Korea, however, issues regarding quality control, development and maintenance of human resources, improvement of laws and regulations for e-learning, and efforts to standardize e-leaming technology need to be pushed forward in tandem-not as discrete issues, but as an integral whole.

DE pejerrey; Pampean lakes; contingent value method; consumer surplus;

AB This study illustrates the importance of assessing social and economic variables for management of recreational pejerrey fisheries in Pampean lakes. We conclude that summer pejerrey anglers differed by lakes in their motivations, preferences, and economic valuation of their fisheries and that most of the differences were attributed to travel distance, facilities, and quality of the fishery. We surveyed four fisheries located in different geographical areas, assessing preference and motivation by interviewing boat anglers at access points and then applying the contingent value method to assess economic values under current and different management conditions. (greater catch or larger size). Results indicated that anglers considered factors other than catching fish to be important, and a continuum of preferences and motivations was observed on a regional basis. Economic analysis yielding expenditures for study lakes averaged US$ 126,000. Consumer surplus for current conditions averaged 30% greater than actual trip costs. Under the preferred management option for the better fishing (greater catch or larger size, depending on the lake), average consumer surplus increased 65% over current expenditures, to US $208,000 per lake. The combination of socio-economic information representing non-market goods with traditional biological and fishery data will provide more comprehensive management criteria to achieve sustainable pejerrey fisheries in Pampean lakes.

TI Water, land and health in urban and peri-urban food production: The case
   of Kano, Nigeria
SO LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE health; environment; urban; peri-urban; food production; Kano; Nigeria
ID MALARIA; AFRICA
AB In sub-Saharan Africa, urban and peri-urban food production has been identified as an important resource for meeting the challenges of rapidly growing cities, and the positive aspects of such production have been well documented in the literature. This paper examines some of the health and environmental concerns associated with urban and peri-urban agriculture (UPA). Empirical evidence from the city of Kano in northern Nigeria suggests that there is currently much reason for concern as industrial and domestic toxins are reaching dangerously high levels. As soils and water channels become increasingly polluted, the sustainability of urban and peri-urban food production is questioned. Since the health implications of long-term exposure to toxins are unclear, it is suggested that coordinated longitudinal research involving urban planners, agricultural scientists and health specialists is urgently needed. In addition, it remains crucial that government and institutional actors effectively monitor and enforce both environmental and zoning by-laws, if the health and environmental constraints of UPA are to be overcome, and the future sustainability of production is to be assured.

Yields of arable crops on agropastoralists' fields were generally low. Livestock productivity was similar on all parameters to levels in comparable contexts elsewhere across the West African subregion, but generally below possible potentials and on-farm research findings. Pastoral households' activities presently influence between 221 km(2) and 523 km(2) of land in Ogun State. Pastoral grazing orbits extended beyond administrative boundaries, causing potential conflicts between local crop farmers and agropatoralists. Much of the land-cover has been altered considerably around the areas of pastoral household settlements compared with the situation 20 years ago. It was concluded that a form of intervention was needed that would guarantee sustainability of the land-use system. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB Shifting cultivation, which long provided the subsistence requirements of a large number of people in the mountains of South and Southeast Asia under a situation of low population, has been shown to be an environmentally and economically unsuitable practice. Efforts have been made throughout the region to replace it with more productive and sustainable land-use systems. Experiences have been mixed. Shifting cultivation has been almost entirely replaced by sedentary agriculture in Nepal, a considerable change has taken place in Thailand, and moderate changes have taken place in Indonesia and Malaysia. However, shifting cultivation is still being widely practised in the mountains of Bangladesh and Laos, and northeastern India. Such interregional variations are explained by several socio-economic, institutional and policy factors, including population growth, government control of common property resources, the land tenure system, physical infrastructure, technology and necessary support services. This paper concludes that the change from shifting to permanent cultivation does not take place automatically with increasing population pressure as postulated by Boserup (1965). It takes place when the favourable condition created by population growth is reinforced by other appropriate measures, including ownership rights to land, development of infrastructure and provision of necessary support services and facilities.

TI Selling sustainable development and shortchanging social ecology in
   Costa Rican forest policy
SO LATIN AMERICAN POLITICS AND SOCIETY

DT Article
AB Costa Ricans have worked hard to weave the norms and principles of sustainable development into their nation's environmental policies, especially with respect to natural renewable resources, such as the forest. As a result, the nation is known as a leader in innovative environmental initiatives. But sustainable development is a complex, evolving concept. This paper analyzes how the emphasis on biodiversity conservation during the 1990s and early 2000s has, rhetoric notwithstanding, neglected the social equality, or livelihood, component of sustainable development. This trend stands in sharp contrast to earlier periods, when decisionmakers crafted policies and institutions that supported social ecology. The article concludes with a few observations on building political will to revive the grassroots development component of sustainable development.

AB The thermoplastics processing of native starch in the presence of water is a recent development with very wide possible applications. Eventually, oil-based polymer materials have to be replaced in many applications by sustainable, inexpensive, natural materials from renewable resources. As with conventional thermoplastics, starch-water melts may be processed by injection moulding and extrusion. The present contribution focuses on injection moulding. The bases of the processing and the thermal and molecular changes occurring are described. In addition, the rheological behaviour of the starch-water melts during processing is analysed quantitatively to give apparent melt viscosities. The dimensional, thermal and mechanical properties of moulded thermoplastic starch polymer (TSP) materials and the products presently being produced from them are discussed.

AB A Field of Dreams was a movie about baseball. The theme was "Build it and They Will Come." Bioprocessing as an industry has been waiting for someone to step up to the plate and build a large business, based on the technology. The large business was necessary to bring about a revolution to move the Chemical and Plastics Industries towards a new business model, based on more sustainable practices. By providing a unique combination of properties in fiber and packaging applications, PLA was the obvious first choice for companies looking to make bioprocessing a commercial reality.

AB In this article an analytical framework for analysing compliance and legitimacy in fisheries management is developed. A precondition for sustainable and efficient fisheries management systems is that the imposed regulations can be controlled and enforced. Furthermore, the management costs shall be reasonable compared to the economic output to be obtained from the fisheries. The analytical framework is based on hypotheses from economic and sociological theories, i.e.: (a) fishers' compliance is determined by economic gains of breaking the rules compared to the risk of being detected, (b) compliance is also determined by the design of the management system and whether the imposed regulations are perceived as legitimate. This relates to both the procedures tinder which the regulations have been decided and to the contents of the regulations, and (c) institutions play a significant role in coordinating various interests in fisheries management and is further a mean to reduce high transaction costs in fisheries management.

AB Transgenic plants expressing resistance to herbivorous insects may represent a safe and sustainable pest control alternative if they do not interfere with the natural enemies of target pests. Here we examined interactions between oryzacystatin I (OCI), a proteinase inhibitor from rice genetically engineered into potato (Solanum tuberosum cv. Kennebec, line K52) to increase resistance to insect herbivory, and the insect predator Perillus bioculatus. This stinkbug is a relatively specialized predator of caterpillars and leaf-beetle larvae, and may also include plant sap in its predominantly carnivorous diet. One of its preferred prey is Colorado potato beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata), a major target of insect resistance development for potato field crops. Gelatin/sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) confirmed that a major fraction of proteinase (gelatinase) activity in P. bioculatus extracts is OCI-sensitive. Among five gelatinolytic bands detected, the slowest-moving one (proteinase 1) was inhibited strongly by purified OCI expressed in Escherichia coli or by OCI-transgenic potato extracts, while three other proteinases were partly sensitive to these treatments. There was also evidence of slight inhibition of proteinase I by untransformed potato foliage, suggesting the presence of a natural inhibitor related to OCI at low level in potato foliage. Interestingly, only about 50% of the maximum potential activity of proteinase I was recovered in extracts of P. bioculatus feeding on L. decemlineata larval prey on a diet of OCI-potato foliage, indicating that the predator was sensitive to OCI in the midgut of its prey. However, P. bioculatus on OCI-prey survived, grew and developed normally, indicating ability to compensate prey-mediated exposure to the OCI inhibitor. Confinement of P. bioculatus to potato foliage provided no evidence that potato plant-derived nutrition is a viable alternative to predation, restriction to potato foliage in fact being inferior to free water for short-term survival of nonfeeding first-instar larvae. These results support the view that OCI, an effective inhibitor of a substantial fraction of digestive enzymatic potential in P. bioculatus, should not interfere with its predation potential when expressed in potato plants fed to its prey at a maximum level of similar to0.8% of total soluble proteins in mature foliage.

AB John Boylston, from Totem Ocean Trailer Express, USA, here discusses designing a new pair of trailer ships for environmental sustainability - thought process, environmental features, their cost and economic impact. This specialist project, the author argues, involves more than looking at current environmental regulations and designing a ship that will comply. Environmental regulations are constantly evolving and in some cases may require retrofitting of a ship during its life. While the economics of a ship can be impacted by designing for future requirements, in the cases cited in this paper, the construction cost does not seem to have been adversely affected.

AB This article describes the Nutrient Management Project of the environmental co-operatives VEL and VANLA as a field laboratory. A field laboratory is defined as a heterogeneous collection of inter-linked scientific studies performed by several actors within a specific field, but - as in normal laboratories with some protection against outside interference and disturbance. The Nutrient Management Project of VEL and VANLA demonstrates several characteristics of field laboratories. Firstly, in the project, dairy farmers and scientists carry out joint research using different sources of knowledge. Secondly, apart from research the actors are engaged in changing the location, thereby developing new knowledge and practices. in the case of VEL and VANLA this means developing the fields and farms towards sustainability. Thirdly, the actors thoughtfully experiment with several research methodologies to gain understanding on a variety of issues. So within the field laboratory of VEL and VANLA there is heterogeneity in themes, disciplines and methodologies. Simultaneously a systems perspective is created as an interpretative scheme that links up all the different activities. Finally, within VEL and VANLA, alignment among practices, research and the institutional context is essential for the continuation of the research activities.

AB The practice of farming implies a continuous process of re-moulding and re-balancing of resources. Normally, this process is slow and hardly noticeable, but in times of transition towards sustainability it is accelerated and becomes more visible. Re-moulding and re-balancing require a careful and multifaceted monitoring as well as a high degree of involvement of the farmers concerned. This article is an overview that documents several aspects of the changes realized by two farmer co-operatives in the northern Netherlands: Vereniging Eastermar's Lansdouwe (VEL) and Vereniging Agrarisch Natuur en Landschapsonderhoud Achtkarspelen (VANLA). It is shown that farmers process and manage manure, silages and diets. Emphasis is given to indications that the newly emerging balances are characterized by high levels of N efficiency. In a final combination of beta and gamma approaches it is shown that the goal-oriented practices of the VEL and VANLA farmers clearly indicate new trajectories towards and prospects for sustainability. Furthermore it is shown that recognition of relevant heterogeneity is crucial and that inter-farm comparisons, careful integration of beta and gamma approaches and multivariate modes of analysis are needed.

AB In this paper the case of the environmental co-operatives VEL and VANLA is reviewed in terms of co-evolving technical and institutional change and the strategic lessons to be learned for a pro-active management of such complex technical-institutional design processes. Facing the many-sided crisis in agriculture the two co-operatives developed a radically different approach. The aim is to re-ground agriculture in local agro-ecological processes following the approach of lowering external inputs (i.e., material inputs, capital and labour). The results are promising: a system-innovation is emerging out of a wide range of connected novel operational practices (i.e., novelties) including technical as well as institutional aspects. The findings of VEL and VANLA stress once again the need for a simultaneous redesign of technical and institutional change to facilitate a transition towards a more sustainable agriculture. Furthermore, we conclude that this transition cannot but be rooted in promising, innovative practices that embody the potential to challenge conventional scientific approaches to sustainable agricultural development. More space should be created for 'smart' experimentation exploring and evaluating the potentialities of different transition paths.

TI Noise limits: A fuzzy set theoretical approach
SO NOISE CONTROL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB Regulatory standards may be based solely on scientific and technical data showing the adverse effects of noise on public health. Usually other aspects such as social, economic and cultural conditions are also considered. In this paper, the vagueness naturally arising in this process is formally recognized and put into a fuzzy set theoretical framework for the first time. A reference system including an unacceptable level and a sustainable level, which are both represented by fuzzy sets, and a crisp policy goal is proposed. The mathematics required to (linguistically) evaluate a situation based on these limits are given. Uncertainty in determining the indicator values can be included in the evaluation. However, the proposed fuzzy evaluation system has the interesting property that it can be reduced to a very simple calculation when the vagueness arises mainly from the limits. The paper also proposes a system for integrating this evaluation over a large population. Several examples are given to illustrate the use of the proposed technique.

AB We raise four challenges to the claim of ecological modernization theory (EMT) that continued modernization is necessary for ecological sustainability. First, EMT needs to go beyond merely demonstrating that societies modify their institutions in reaction to environmental problems and show that such modifications lead to ecological improvements. Second, EMT must show that late stages of modernizing processes lead to the ecological transformation of production and consumption at relatively high frequency. Third, EMT must demonstrate that industries or firms that are reducing their direct impact on the environment are not contributing to the expansion of negative impacts by other industries or firms. Fourth, EMT must show not only that economies are becoming more resource efficient but also that the pace of increase in efficiency exceeds the pace of increase in overall production. In this article, we review the existing evidence and find that EMT has insufficiently addressed these four issues.

TI Sustainable agriculture in the semi-arid agro-pastoral interweaving belt
   of northern China - A case-study of west Jilin province
SO OUTLOOK ON AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
DE sustainable agriculture; vulnerability; degradation; SAPIB
AB The semi-arid agro-pastoral interweaving belt (SAPIB) is an important ecological zone in northern China and an important food base. However, sustainable agricultural development has been restricted by both natural and socioeconomic factors. It is inherently vulnerable because of its unfavourable climate and geological and hydrogeomorphological conditions. Agricultural production has been impaired by frequent natural disasters' salinization and desertification. Moreover, irrational agricultural policies and practices, poverty and other socioeconomic factors have brought about degradation in the SAPIB. The authors argue that the basis for a sustainable strategy is to transform it by increasing exergy input, changing the cultural outlook and harmonizing interactions between the component subsystems. Finally, a series of proposals based on notions for a sustainable strategy is put forward.

DE sustainable agriculture; semi-arid; salinity; acid sulphate soils;
   oases; Nigeria
AB Peasant farmers in the Manga Grasslands of semi-arid north-east Nigeria depend largely on agriculture for their livelihood. However, recurrent drought since the early 1970s has disrupted the traditional farming systems of the region, and hence the agriculture-based rural economy of the Grasslands. There is evidence that farmers in the Grasslands are obliged to intensify crop production in areas with 'good' soils and 'adequate' water supply, that is, the oases. The rich organic soils and the shallow, semi-confined water table beneath the oases are precious natural resources for intensive agriculture. These do not come without a price, however, as the rich, organic soils have the potential to be contaminated by acid sulphate and salt. It is expected that future soil creation, particularly under dry climatic conditions, will lead to the formation of true acid sulphate soils, and consequently, the twin processes of soil acidification and salinization will present real management problems for sustainable agriculture. It is concluded however, that under the prevailing soil, hydrological and climatic conditions of the oasis, sustainable agricultural production remains elusive.

AB The purpose of this paper is to determine the effects of the United Nations Agenda 21 on non-governmental organizations' (NGOs) efforts to promote sustainable forestry in Thailand. The author focuses on the impact of Agenda 21 on three main factors that influence NGO activity: the NGO relationship with international donors, the NGO relationship with the Thai government, and the direct impact of Agenda 21 upon NGO policies and actions. Agenda 21 includes goals aimed at countering the problem of global deforestation by increasing the use of sustainable forestry practices and increasing cooperation between governments and NGOs. However, the three areas examined in this paper indicate that Agenda 21 has had a small and uneven impact upon forest-related NGOs in Thailand.

AB For over 30 years, Hidalgo County, a geographically isolated and financially stressed community in the southwestern corner of New Mexico, has struggled to develop a stable primary health care service. The retirement of the county's general practitioner in the 1970s was followed by several decades of misses, near-misses, and out-and-out failures, when the community found it difficult to attract and impossible to keep a physician. In order to organize and fund a stable medical clinic, the community had. to adapt to the realities of a new era in medicine. Primary care physicians in rural communities need access to medical information and to specialists, help in coping with the economic pressures of medical care, and support that will enable them to develop a sustainable lifestyle. Hidalgo County now has a modern health care delivery system. The experiences that led to the creation of the present clinic provide insight into the problems for the delivery of primary health care in remote areas and suggest solutions that may be relevant to other communities across rural America.

AB The growth of plants is repressed by DELLA proteins, nuclear regulators whose activities are opposed by the growth-promoting phytohormone gibberellin (GA). Mutations affecting DELLA protein function were previously used by plant breeders to create the high-yielding semidwarf wheat varieties of the green revolution. gai is an Arabidopsis mutant DELLA protein-encoding orthologue of the wheat semidwarfing genes. Here we describe the development of a transgene that confers ethanol-inducible gai expression. Transient induction of gai causes transient growth repression: growth prior to and after treatment is unaffected. Appropriate ethanol treatments result in dwarf plants that produce the same numbers of seeds as untreated controls. This new technology represents a substantial advance in the applicability of genes encoding mutant DELLA proteins to agricultural and horticultural improvement, enhancing the flexibity with which these genes can be used for the sustainable achievement of increased crop plant yields.

AB Somatic embryogenesis (SE), the most promising technology for the large-scale production of high-value coniferous trees from advanced breeding and genetic engineering programs, is expected to play an important role in increasing productivity, sustainability, and the uniformity of future U.S. forests. To be successful for commercial use, SE technology must work with a variety of genetically diverse trees. Initiation in loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.), our main focus species, is often recalcitrant for desirable genotypes. Initiation percentages of loblolly pine, Douglas-fir [Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco], and Norway spruce (Picea abies L., Karst.) were improved through the use of brassinolide. Brassinosteroids, which include brassinolide, are a relatively new group of natural plant growth regulators that are found in many plant species. They have been shown to have diverse, tissue-specific, and species-specific effects, including the stimulation of cell elongation and ethylene production and increasing resistance to abiotic stress. In our media, brassinolide was effective at concentrations ranging from 0.005-0.25 muM. Using control medium (no brassinolide) and brassinolide-supplemented (0.1 muM) medium, we achieved improved initiation percentages in loblolly pine, Douglas-fir, Norway spruce, and rice-15.0% to 30.1%, 16.1% to 36.3%, 34.6% to 47.4%, and 10%, respectively. Brassinolide increased the weight of loblolly pine embryogenic tissue by 66% and stimulated initiation in the more recalcitrant families of loblolly pine and Douglas-fir, thus compensating somewhat for genotypic differences in initiation. Initiation percentages in loblolly pine were improved through the combination of modified 1/2-P6 salts, 50 mg/l activated carbon (AC), adjusted levels of Cu and Zn (to compensate for adsorption by AC), 1.5% maltose, 2% myo-inositol (to raise the osmotic level, partially simulating the megagametophyte environment), 500 mg/l casamino acids, 450 mg/l glutamine, 2 mg/l alpha-naphthaleneacetic acid, 0.63 mg/l 6-benzylaminopurine, 0.61 mg/l kinetin, 3.4 mg/l silver nitrate, 10 muM cGMP, 0.1 muM brassinolide, and 2 g/l Gelrite. Across 12 open-pollinated families of loblolly pine, initiation percentages ranged from 2.5% to 50.7%, averaging 22.5%.

AB In a hilly area in Lampung State, the southern end of Sumatra Island in Indonesia, coffee is commonly cultivated on hillsides with steep slopes and soil erosion affects sustainable coffee production. A field experiment on coffee cultivation was conducted for 4 years to evaluate the effects of alley cropping and no-tillage on the seed production of coffee and on erosion control in a steep slope area in this region. The cultivation of intercropped vegetables, red peppers, tomatoes, and long beans was introduced into the coffee fields when the coffee plants were small. No significant differences in the yields of either the coffee plants or the intercropped vegetables were noted among the treatments. Coffee shoot fresh weight, however, was slightly increased by no-tillage treatment. Soil erosion was reduced by 37% as a result of no tillage and by 64% with alley cropping. The amount of soil erosion for local farmers practice, tillage & no-alley, was more than four times that in no-tillage and alley treatment. These results indicate that alley cropping and no-tillage are effective for erosion control on coffee fields on steep slopes and that yield is not affected by these practices. The introduction of intercropped vegetables is beneficial in terms of farm economy, especially when the income from coffee cultivation is limited.

TI Post-communist Russia in the post-industrial world: The quest for
   catching-up policy
SO POST-COMMUNIST ECONOMIES
LA English
DT Article
AB This article discusses the strategy of economic development of Russia, which has to be developed after the end of the first stage of post-communist transition--when the private economy replaced the state-controlled one and stabilisation was achieved. Russia is considered to be a heavily industrialised country, which has faced the challenges of post-industrial modernisation in the logic of catching-up development. This makes it different from so-called 'new industrial states'--countries that have to resolve the task of transformation of a traditional (agrarian) society to an industrial one. The analysis is based on Gerschenkron's approach to 'accelerated industrialisation' and its adjustment to the post-industrial world. The author suggests a set of economic policy principles which could ensure sustainable economic growth and stimulate structural reforms appropriate for the new challenges, that is to stimulate transformation of an industrial country to a post-industrial one. This is considered as a 'policy of catching-up post-industrialisation'.

SO PROCESS SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION

DT Article
AB Ten years ago the Rio de Janeiro environmental summit injected a new urgency into the imperative that economic development must be done in ways that can be sustained for future generations. Since that summit, the concept of 'Sustainability' has become widely accepted as a uniting and purposeful focus for the twenty-first century. In the decade since Rio science and technology has made some of its greatest ever contributions to reducing the environmental footprint of human activity, but the scorecard is still mixed. We have acknowledged some of the weaknesses of reductionist, individualist approaches that contribute to 'the tragedy of the (social and environmental) commons'. The challenge for chemical engineering is to evolve to suit this new context, so that it may continue to make a valued and knowledgeable contribution, emerging as a more sustainable profession.

ID FRAMEWORK
AB World energy demand is expected to increase to several times its current level over the next 50 years. Much of this energy will come from fossil fuel, a finite resource, which moreover generates carbon dioxide, a cause of global warming. The incentive to develop other, renewable forms of energy is therefore strong, but how can we be sure that our expectations for the future form a rational basis for determining energy policy? The scenario planning technique does not attempt to predict the future, but offers a variety of visions against which current actions and policies can be tested. To guide the move towards a more sustainable future it is also important to be able to monitor our progress. The use of sustainability metrics, tailored to a particular purpose, and relating to resource efficiency, environmental protection, economic benefits and social development, is a way of quantifying this progress. The set of indicators illustrates the 'sustainability footprint' of an enterprise.

AB Corporate sustainability is not just a buzzword-for many industry leaders and corporations, it has become an invaluable tool for exploring ways to reduce costs, manage risks, create new products, and drive fundamental internal changes in culture and structure. However, integrating sustainability thinking and practice into organizational structure is not a trivial task and it requires a vision, commitment and leadership. It also requires a systems approach with an appropriate management framework that enables design, management and communication of corporate sustainability policies.
   This paper proposes a general framework for a Corporate Sustainability Management System (CSMS) which enables translation of the general principles of sustainable development into corporate practice by providing a systematic, step-by-step guidance towards a more sustainable business. Developed in collaboration with industry, it is designed to help improve the triple bottom line through sustainable economic development and environmental protection, while encouraging socially responsible business values. To facilitate an easier integration into the organizational structure, the CSMS follows the familiar models of Total Quality and Environmental Management Systems. While in principle applicable to industry in general, the system is flexible enough to be adapted to the specific needs of individual companies and the contexts in which they operate. Application of the CSMS is illustrated on suitable examples throughout.

ID LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT; PROCESS DESIGN; SYSTEMS; FRAMEWORK; OPTIMIZATION
AB In a transition towards a sustainable petrochemical industry, its systemic structure and functions must be considered degrees-of-freedom in the search for and the specification of development options that reach beyond traditional research and development (R&D) and beyond the optimization of proven technology, proven system concepts and established process networks. Functional modelling allows technology-free specification of systems, generalization of system concepts, and recalibration of the use or value of substances in a petrochemical network. It facilitates moving up or down the ladder of system aggregation levels, which allows one to 'step out of the box' to the plant or chemical complex level, or alternatively to connect to the unit-operation level. Application to the aromatics industry serves to illustrate that thereby the abstraction from present system content and from proven technology is achieved, which allows the specification of the desired content of technological inventions that enable or rely upon changes in system structure: process system innovations. The realization of trigenerate functions through the petrochemical industry involves a paradigm-shift. Rather than considering the industry a threatening source of pollution, safety and health risks, it is an enabler of global CO2 emission reduction.

AB his paper explores the role of Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) and Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) in the evolutionary design of minerals processes. Use is made of a modified hierarchical approach to process design, taking into account the specific features of minerals technologies, and the challenges these accord to process synthesis and detailed process design. These include linked reactor-separator combinations, as well as complex recycle structures which are integrated with the selection and operation of waste management technologies. Process synthesis is posed as a design problem with multiple objectives, and consideration is given to how design decisions are informed by valuation choices, specifically where these relate to environmental performance. The discussion is couched in the context of decision support tools which promote the sustainability of the industry, and some guidance is offered to designers on which multi-criteria decision support tools have value as the design evolves from concept to detailed engineering stages. The approach is illustrated for a particular base metals design study. It is demonstrated that combinations of technologies, rather than the usual vendor-specified discrete technology choices, can offer enhancements in both economic and environmental performance, and are thus consistent with the push to more sustainable practices within the resources sector.

DE Ghana; small-scale mining; gold; diamonds; sustainable development
AB The small-scale gold and diamonds mining industry is of great importance to Ghana. Since its regularization in 1989 the sector has produced and sold over 1.5 million troy ounces of gold and 8.0 million carats of diamonds. During the same period the sector also provided direct employment to over 100,000 people and improved the socioeconomic life of many individuals and communities. However, these were largely achieved at a cost to the environment in areas where mining is carried out and there is the need to develop the industry in a sustainable manner. This paper looks at the developments in the small-scale gold and diamonds mining industry in Ghana and proposes some strategies on how the concepts of sustainable development could be applied to the industry.

DT Article
DE environmental accounts; natural capital depreciation; sustainability
AB This paper estimates the true economic income for the Chilean mining sector, using the welfare foundations for the usual net domestic product (NDP) income measure of the traditional National Accounts System (NAS) provided by [Weitzman, M., 1976. On the welfare significance of national product in a dynamic economy. Quarterly Journal of Economics. 90, 156-162; Weitzman, M., 2000. The linearised Hamiltonian as comprehensible NDP. Environment and Development Economics. 5, 55-68]. The total depletion of natural capital caused by mining is calculated by estimating, on the one hand, the depreciation of resources (using the net price approach) and, on the other, the environmental costs provoked by mining activity. The results show that, correcting the usual GDP measure for man-made capital depreciation plus the total loss of natural capital, the standard mining GDP measure of the NAS overestimates by 31-36% the economic income generated by Chile's mining sector during the period 1985-1996.

AB Soil compaction is one of the main consequences of inadequate soil management and can lead to a loss of the agricultural sustainability. The compressive behavior of a clayey Red Latosol (Oxisol) under four water tensions and under native vegetation, no-till, and conventional till with a disk plow for two decades was studied. Undisturbed soil samples were used to characterize the soil porosity and for uniaxial compression tests. Preconsolidation pressures and compression indexes were obtained from the soil compression curves, and the soil bulk density evaluated. Disturbed soil samples were used for physical and chemical characterization analyses. The soil water tensions of the range between the field capacity and the permanent wilting point, as well as the soil management systems affected the intensity of soil deformation. Highest values were observed for the field capacity (-6 kPa) and the native vegetation. The pressure values that could reduce the soil porosity to critical levels for the plant development, and which are also a function of the initial soil porosity, varied in all soil management systems. Lowest values were observed under wet conditions. Independent of the soil management system, water tension, and soil depth, the percentage of volume reduction in the total soil porosity at the pressures that do not cause additional soil compaction (preconsolidation pressure), were practically constant and, in general, below 10 %.

AB Since 1857 new Australians have constructed many thousands of weirs (3600 in the Murray-Darling Basin alone) and floodplain levee banks, 446 large dams (> 10 m crest height) and over 50 intra- and inter-basin water transfer schemes to secure water supplies for human use. Flow regulation has changed the hydrology of major rivers on three temporal sales-the flood pulse (days to weeks), flow history (weeks to years) and the long-term statistical pattern of flows, or flow regime (decades or longer). The regulation of river flows is widely acknowledged as a major cause of deteriorating conditions in many Australian river and floodplain ecosystems. In response to mounting environmental concerns, all states, territories and the Commonwealth Government have committed the nation to the principles of ecologically sustainable development and a process of national water reform. Rivers and wetlands are now recognized as legitimate 'users' of water, and jurisdictions must provide water allocations to sustain and where necessary restore ecological processes and the biodiversity of water-dependent ecosystems. Progress in the protection and restoration of river and wetland water regimes has been significant, with over half of mainland aquatic systems designated to receive water allocations of some sort. However, exactly how much water they will receive or retain is unclear from the data available. Moreover, the ecological outcomes and benefits of water allocations are not yet apparent in most aquatic ecosystems, with the exception of certain waterbird breeding events, the disruption of algal blooms in weirs and improved fish passage. After reviewing these issues, this paper addresses two vital questions: How much water does a river need? and How can this water be clawed back from other users? Studies conducted to date in Queensland rivers suggest that around 80-92% of natural mean annual flow (and other ecologically relevant hydrological indicators) may be needed to maintain a low risk of environmental degradation. In the Top End of the Northern Territory, some rivers are maintained at 80% of their natural flow, whereas two-thirds of various flow indicators has been proposed as the restoration target for the River Murray, and 28% of natural mean annual flow has been negotiated for the Snowy River in Victoria. To validate these estimates, ecologists are seeking opportunities to turn river restoration projects into long-term hypothesis-driven experiments in ecological restoration, and the funding, time and institutional support to do so. The paper ends with some suggestions to advance the water reforms and achieve higher levels of water allocation for the environment. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB Sustainable use of river ecosystems requires that they be managed holistically. This paper describes an holistic methodology, DRIFT (Downstream Response to Imposed Flow Transformation), for advising on environmental flows for rivers targetted for water-management activities. DRIFT's basic philosophy is that all major abiotic and biotic components constitute the ecosystem to be managed; and within that, the full spectrum of flows, and their temporal and spatial variability, constitute the flows to be managed. The methodology employs experienced scientists from the following biophysical disciplines: hydrology, hydraulics, fluvial geomorphology, sedimentology, chemistry, botany and zoology. Where there are subsistence users of the river, the following socio-economic disciplines are also employed: sociology, anthropology, water supply, public health, livestock health and resource economics.
   DRIFT is a structured process for combining data and knowledge from all the disciplines to produce flow-related scenarios for water managers to consider. It consists of four modules. In the first, or biophysical module, the river ecosystem is described and predictive capacity developed on how it would change with flow changes. In the second, or socio-economic module, links are described between riparian people who are subsistence users of river resources, the resources they use, and their health. The objective is to develop predictive capacity of how river changes would impact their lives. In the third module, scenarios are built of potential future flows and the impacts of these on the river and the riparian people. The fourth, or economic module, lists compensation and mitigation costs.
   DRIFT should run in parallel with two other exercises which are external to it: a macro-economic assessment of the wider implications of each scenario, and a Public Participation Process whereby people other than subsistence users can indicate the level of acceptability of each scenario.
   DRIFT has been developed in a semi-arid, developing region, where water-supply problems are pressing, and uncertainties about river-linked ecological and social processes high. The use of DRIFT in this context is discussed. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB Besides its clearly normative value, the idea of sustainability reflects a number of needs and absences: the unsustainable character of present patterns of development, the question of explicit representation of beings such as coming generations, absent from the scenes where the future is being committed. confession of the legitimacy trouble touching environmental policies facing development stakes, and, as a more intimate disillusion, the discovery that the sustainability idea cannot stand for an alternative legitimacy principle. After having shown how sustainability passed several of the requirements characteristic of a principle of legitimacy, the article identifies the sources of its weakness as lying in its difficulties with the axioms of "common humanity", and more particularly with "equal power of access to social states" which are inherent in the "fair city" model. But, taken separately, each existing legitimacy principle does not offer any better solution, because it runs into the problem of promises regarding the future. Sustainable development must therefore he sought in "compromise", i.e. that type of legitimacy in which societies do not succeed in completely explicating the basis of their agreement, while nevertheless being guided by the pursuit of a common good.

ID TECHNOLOGY
AB Within environmental social sciences, the authors believe that the analysis of sustainable production should be complemented by bringing in issues of sustainable consumption and lifestyles. It is possible to place a stronger emphasis on consumption issues without lapsing into the socio-psychological models that were used for so long in the analyses of environmental (un) friendly behaviors of citizen-consumers. The article argues that the social practices model, derived from structuration theory, offers a feasible alternative in this respect, because the model makes possible a sociological, "contextual'' approach to consumption behaviors and lifestyles. The kind of questions the social practices model generates for empirical research are illustrated using the example of domestic consumption of utility products and services. By discussing a number of pilot studies within Dutch environmental policymaking, the future agenda of the politics of sustainable consumption is explored and commented upon.

AB This article examines environmental activists' views of place-based collaboration and how they have related to it in the management of U. S. national forests. We first present a brief historical overview of the issues that led to the emergence of place-based collaboration in the U. S. West. We then discuss the main themes in the environmentalist critique of place-based collaboration. Next we present case studies of three prominent examples of place-based collaboration in the West - the Quincy Library Group in California and the Applegate Partnership and Lake County Community Sustainability Initiative in Oregon - to explore the relationship of environmentalists to place-based collaboration. We conclude with a discussion of the possibilities for environmentalists in place-based collaboration.

AB This is the first quantitative, cross-national study that incorporates predictors designed to test hypotheses linking overurbanization to environmentally induced migration. The study is based on a sample of fifty-eight developing countries using lagged dependent variable panel regression. Our major findings are quite clear with respect to newer rural-push and urban-pull arguments that developing countries suffering from various forms of environmental degradation are prone to overurbanization. Deforestation exerts a positive and significant effect on overurbanization, whereas environmental sustainability exerts a negative and significant effect on overurbanization. In addition, our results support hypotheses derived from the political modernization perspective that civil society and democratic regimes help to reduce overurbanization, as well as hypotheses suggested by neo-Malthusian theory that high levels of population growth contribute to high levels of overurbanization. We also find support for dependency theory in that transnational economic linkages based on multinational corporations and international lending institutions foster increased overurbanization in the developing world.

AB Soil organic matter (SOM) is considered to be key to sustainability of agriculture in the tropics. In southern Brazil, no-tillage has been adopted widely to control soil erosion, but its impact on the dynamics of SOM is not well established. We measured soil carbon (C) and delta(13)C in two crop rotations, one of which contained C4 maize (Zea mays L.), after 21 years of contrasting tillage (conventional tillage versus no-tillage). Adjacent sites that reflected historic land-uses were also sampled. In the tillage experiment there was no effect of tillage on the total amount of C in the 0-40 cm profile (even when contrasting bulk density was accounted for), and the concentration of C differed only in the 0-5 cm and 5-10 cm layers. However, the occasional input of C4 material in the maize rotation resulted in a significant effect of rotation on delta(13)C (P<0.001). Using C-13 as a tracer for the SOM formed since the start of the experiment, we estimated the abundance of 'recent' and 'old' C within each depth interval. We found the main effect of tillage was to increase the medium-term turnover of SOM, particularly in the subsoil (i.e. below 20 cm depth). Compared with no-tillage, there was almost five times more recent C in the subsoil, and 20% more recent C in the 0-40 cm profile as a whole.

AB Household consumption and direct-use values of a range of savanna bio-resources were quantified for 110 households across three villages in the Mametja Traditional Authority, Limpopo province, South Africa. The relationship between household wealth status and use of natural resources was also assessed. We found that the use of natural resources was extensive, the most common being wooden utensils, grass handbrooms, twig handbrooms, fuelwood, wild herbs, wild fruit and edible insects. Households in the poorest of the three villages consumed the most wooden utensils, wild herbs, wild fruit and thatching grass. Fuelwood was widely used, even though two of the three villages had electricity, and consumption was highest in the largest, most developed village. The mean annual direct-use value of indigenous bio-resources, averaged across all households, was R3959 per household or R564 per person. The value was highest in the poorest of the three villages. Poor households relied most heavily on 'essential' natural resources such as wild foods, whereas comparatively wealthy households used a wider range of resources and utilized greater amounts of 'luxury' items, such as wooden utensils and poles. These findings are discussed in the context of poverty and sustainable rural development, and should be of value to scientists, community developers, and policy-makers.

AB On January 1st 2000 the European regulation EURO III came into force, establishing severe limits to the allowable exhaust pipe emissions from IC engines. In 2005 the European regulation EURO IV will be introduced, entraining even tighter limits. During the last few years the environmental legislation has fostered a noticeable effort in the field of pollutant gas emissions from IC engines and the car manufacturers worldwide have developed those gases after treatment techniques, which are now very well established and have allowed for a significant reduction in the atmospheric pollution. To comply with future standards, the automotive industry will resort to several different technological strategies currently under development, such as direct fuel injection, the electro-hydraulic valve timing, advanced after-treatment system and the introduction of alternative, less polluting fuels, like compressed natural gas. However, a major environmental concern like the 'greenhouse effect' and climate change, whose solution is crucial for a sustainable economic growth, cannot be faced by means of the aforementioned technologies, since the emission of water vapour and carbon dioxide, one of the gases recognised as responsible for the greenhouse effect, is intrinsic to the combustion process itself. Therefore, the only viable approach to an improvement of the greenhouse effect is the reduction of fuel consumption, which can be achieved both by means of an increase in the power train efficiency and a reduction of the overall vehicle weight, besides improved aerodynamic and rolling efficiency. Surface engineering, in general, and plasma surface engineering, in particular, can play an important role in helping to achieve both objectives of enhancing the engine efficiency and of decreasing the vehicle weight. In this paper, some considerations will be offered regarding the possible application of plasma surface engineering in contributing to the outlined goals. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

TI Learning for sustainability transition through bounded socio-technical
   experiments in personal mobility
SO TECHNOLOGY ANALYSIS & STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB A bounded socio-technical experiment (BSTE) attempts to introduce a new technology, service, or a social arrangement on a small scale. Many such experiments in personal mobility are ongoing worldwide. They are carried out by coalitions of diverse actors, and are driven by long term and large scale visions of advancing society's sustainability agenda. This paper focuses on the processes of higher-order learning that occur through BSTEs. Based on the conceptual frameworks from theories of organizational learning, policy-oriented learning, and diffusion of innovation, we identify two types of learning: the first type occurs among the participants in the experiment and their immediate professional networks; the second type occurs in the society at large. Both types play a key role in the societal transition towards sustainable mobility systems. Two case studies, in which the Design for Sustainability Group at Technical University of Delft has participated, provide empirical data for the analysis. One case consists of development of a three-wheeled bike-plus vehicle (Mitka); the second case seeks to solve mobility problems on the Dutch island of Texel. We find that higher order learning of the first type occurs among the BSTE participants and beyond. Learning can be facilitated by deployment of structured visioning exercises, by diffusion of ideas among related BSTEs, by innovative couplings of problems and solutions, and by creating links among related experiments. Government agencies, universities and other intellectual entrepreneurs have key roles to play in making that happen. The cases provide much less insights about the second type of learning. Research on the latter is necessary.

AB Based on a study of the emerging microturbine industry, this paper argues that recent trends towards preventive and product-oriented industrial environmental management are problematic from the technology suppliers' perspective. This is especially evident in the suppliers' initial efforts to define markets and applications during early stages of commercialization. The distinction between product innovation driven by explicit or perceived user needs and innovation in environmental technology driven by regulatory demands has become blurred. This means that suppliers have had to interact simultaneously with both users and regulators in order to articulate the demand and acceptance for the new technology.

AB This paper considers the role of the seven innovation capability dimensions (learning, research and development (R&D), manufacturing, marketing, organizational, resource allocating and strategy planning) and the three firm characteristics (domestic market share, size and productivity growth rate) in determining the export performances for a sample of 213 Chinese industrial firms. The empirical analysis of this research reveals the findings listed below:
   1. Export growth is closely related to the total improvement of innovation capability dimensions, except for the manufacturing capability.
   2. While domestic market share has no significant impact on export performances, productivity growth rate significantly increases or promotes export performances rates. Furthermore, while the larger firms demonstrate stronger export competitiveness, there has been no finding of an inverted U-shaped relationship between export and firm size.
   3. The core innovation assets (a set of R&D, manufacturing and marketing) alone cannot lead to sustainable export growth. On the contrary, the supplementary innovation assets (a set of four other dimensions) not only enable a firm's technology assets to permeate into the entire competency integration, but also make it possible for a firm to acquire sustainable international competitiveness.
   This paper shows that the interaction and harmonizing of various innovation assets are the primary factors in the improvement of international competitiveness of Chinese firms. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper attempts to analyze the first findings of a survey-driven study of entrepreneurship students at the undergraduate, graduate, and continuing (professional) education levels in France and in the US. Our findings, albeit derived from an early stage of our ongoing field research and more exploratory than normative at this point, indicate that at least on the French side, there are attitudes and perceptions that are less positive towards entrepreneurship and its impact, as well as more cynical towards situational and institutional factors that could provide a supportive environment for entrepreneurial ventures or act as impediments to its growth. Our results could provide insights for both entrepreneurship educators as well as economic development policy makers in identifying the maximum leverage and critical success and failure factors influencing educational programs as well as economic incentives targeted on the development of sustainable entrepreneurial culture and ventures in France and possibly other countries as well.

AB Laundries are the greatest consumers of fresh water and detergents for washing textiles, which is why the treatment of these effluent is very important. By using chemical analyses from laundry it was found that some parameters' values were exceeded in regard to the "Decree of substance emission during removal of wastewater from laundry and chemical cleaning" (UL RS no.46/02). The purpose of investigation was the possibility of treating laundry effluent using advanced oxidation processes (AOP) and membrane technology in order to recycle water. On the basis of the results, using membrane technology (application of ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis) wastewater was purified good enough for reuse and closing the cycle in washing process, while AOP method represented a good alternative only in ecological sense, due to high expenses. All mentioned is in concept of sustainable development.

TI Prediction of minor stream delays at a limited priority freeway merge
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper presents the development and application of a limited priority gap acceptance model to freeway merging. In the limited priority model, drivers in the major stream at a merge area may incur delay in restoring small headways to a larger, sustainable minimum headway between them and the vehicle in front. This allows minor stream drivers to accept smaller gaps. The headway distributions are assumed to be distributed according to Cowan's M3 model, whose terms were calibrated for this system. Minor stream minimum follow-on time was calibrated, and a realistic range of the critical gap identified.
   An equation was developed for minimum average minor stream delay. A function was identified to model the relationship between minor stream average delay and degree of saturation. The shape parameter of this function was calibrated using simulated traffic flow data, under three different minor stream arrival pattern regimes.
   The model provides a useful means of comparing performance, through average minor stream delay, for varying minor and major stream flow rates and minor stream critical gap, under arrival patterns that differ due to traffic control upstream of the on-ramp. Minor stream delay is a particularly useful measure of effectiveness for uncongested freeway merging as it relates directly to the distance required to merge. Observations from the model developed provide physical evidence that minor stream drivers incur lesser delay, or have a better chance of merging quickly, when they arrive at constant intervals as is the case under constant departure ramp metering, than when they arrive in bunches downstream of a signalised intersection, or even a semi-bunched state downstream of an unsignalised intersection.

AB Identifying policies that will result in a sustainable transportation system is a major challenge for policy makers since it involves a high level of uncertainty regarding the future effect of a given policy package on the transportation system and the urban environment. In this paper, we suggest and use a scenario approach to explore the future development of the Tel-Aviv Metropolitan Area (TAMA). We have constructed two scenarios for the future development of the TAMA: an expected scenario and a desired scenario. The scenarios were constructed by means of a two-round Delphi expert-based survey. Based on the opinion of the experts, our research examines the potential policy measures, which may contribute to a sustainable transportation system in Tel-Aviv. The development of both expected and desired scenarios helped to analyze the feasibility of the desired scenario and assess the likelihood of implementation of its different elements. According to the results, the key elements in the desired scenario are a highly developed public transport system, better coordination between the spatial development and the transportation system, high parking fees, congestion pricing and maintaining the functional role of the Central Business District area. The expected scenario shares many common elements with the desired scenario, which is considered a positive result. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The Spanish National Hydrological Plan (NHP) fits in with a water management model based on "supply" strategies under the expectancy of large subsidies. This paper analyzes the key factors for the foreseeable failure of this Plan. Environmental questions, because of the lack of attention to the logic and challenges of sustainable development; sociopolitical questions, because of the unbalanced and inequitable approach to territorial development, from an authoritarian position with a lack of real public participation; but above all, the many economic questions are extensively developed. The paper presents the results of a recent economic cost-benefit assessment on the inter-basin transfer projected in the NHP, compared to the assessment presented by the Spanish Government. The critical comparison of the two shows the errors and failings of the Government's study. The final result offers a negative balance with a Current Net Value of -3,556.338 ME, which clearly demonstrates the economic irrationality of these transfer projects. Finally, alternative and cheaper strategies to solve the problems of the areas to receive the transfer, based on a "management demand" and "conservation" approach, are summarized.

AB The paper analyzes the problem of collective water management in Spain. The paper has two main objectives: first it provides a brief introduction on long established traditions for collective water management under Water User Associations (WUAs), some dating back to the twelfth century. It discusses the legislative and institutional frameworks that have favored collective water management. The second objective is an analysis at a more specific level, by focusing on the particular case of groundwater as a traditional common pool resource and the problem of mutually beneficial collective action (MBCA). It does so by applying the Institutional Development Framework and an in depth analysis of key factors leading to MBCA. A comparative case study approach is applied to three main aquifers in the central Mancha region. It points to the importance that WUAS can play in facilitating factors that encourage collective action. It also highlights the relevance of social capital as trust between WUAs and the administration, like Water Authorities. It concludes that while solutions like subsidies and payments can help mitigate aquifer overuse, these are not a long-term or sustainable option (economically or sustainably). Only sound institutional design of Water User organizations can favor self-governance and management by farmers.

AB The "Convention on Co-operation for Protection and Sustainable Use of Portuguese-Spanish River Basins, " effective since January 2000, corresponds to a new and expected phase on bilateral water resources issues, applying to a basin-wide ecosystem protection of all shared rivers and aiming at risk prevention improvement on those basins. After a brief analysis of shared water resources and uses and of the current and foreseen Portuguese water resources planning, legal, and institutional contexts, an identification is made of water problems to be solved in common or bilaterally and some of the downstream impacts. Thereafter, a brief description of the Convention provisions is presented, relating it to International Law and to European Union (EU) water policy, namely to the Water Framework Directive. The compatibility of both active documents is analyzed, as well as the needs for institutional capacity building and for monitoring their application, with special emphasis on the Portuguese case, taking into account the two countries' differing institutional water organization, water planning development stages and methodologies, and the public participation tradition on decision-making processes. Special emphasis is given to the relevance of the Convention's institutional boards to the common implementation process.

AB The sustainability of animal production systems is a dynamic and continously process not a state and has variable aspects for different regions and parts of the world.
   To put sustainability of animal production in concrete terms indicator systems are used to describe what is causing changes in environmental conditions (driving force), what are the effects on the environment (state) and what are the actions in the public sector to respond to changes in the state of the environment (response).
   The study present some important indicators to access sustainability in (intensively) animal production systems specially a set of environmental performance indicators (nitrogen surplus, nutrient efficiency, emissions and heavy metalls in manure).

AB A reliable breeding technique was developed for the mangrove red snapper, Lutjanus argentimaculatus (Forsskal 1775), to help sustain the aquaculture of this immensely popular species in Southeast Asia. Using standardized indices of female maturity (based on mean oocyte diameter of greater than or equal to0.40 mm), time of injection (1000-1130) and sex ratio (one female to two males'), a single injection of 100 mug kg(-1) luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogue (LHRHa) (n = 16 fish), but not 50 mug kg(-1) (n = five fish), successfully induced egg (62.5% success rate) and larval (43.8%) production. Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) at 500 IU kg(-1) (n = five fish) also failed to induce spawning, but doses of 1000 (n = 22 fish) and 1500 IU kg(-1) (n = 15 fish) gave spawning (77.3% and 80.0% respectively) and hatching success rates (72.7% and 60.0% respectively) that were not significantly different from those of 100 mug kg(-1) LHRHa. No, spawning was observed in saline-injected controls (n = seven fish). While mean spawning latency, egg diameter, egg production per spawn, percent egg viability, hatching rate, percent of normal larvae and cumulative survival of eggs to normal larvae did not differ significantly among the effective hormones and doses, 1000 IU kg(-1) hCG had a higher percentage (76.5%) of total spawns with egg production per spawn In excess of one million than those of 1500 IU kg(-1) hCG (50.0%) and 100 mug kg(-1) LHRHa (40.0%). Mangrove red snapper spontaneously spawned from March-April to November-December with a peak of egg collection and spawning in May-June. Egg collection per spawn ranged from 0.05 to 6.35 million. Spontaneous spawning of mangrove red snapper exhibited lunar periodicity with spawns mostly occurring 3 days before or after the last quarter and new moon phases and occurred consistently between 02:00 and 04:00 hours. High fecundity and good egg quality, coupled with the ability to respond to induce spawning or natural spawning in captivity, provide a sound basis for improving the sustainability of red snapper aquaculture in Southeast Asia.

ID TRANSPIRATION
AB Sugar industries in Australia and Swaziland rely on irrigation to a large extent (60 and 100%, respectively) to produce a viable crop. Some large irrigation schemes are vulnerable to degradation of ground water quality and it is important to have reliable estimates of water use in order to better calculate runoff and drainage losses from sugarcane fields. It is also important to improve estimates of crop water use in order to improve irrigation design parameters and scheduling. Matching water supply and demand on a daily or weekly basis is essential for productivity and sustainability in any irrigation scheme. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation has recently produced clear guidelines ('FAO 56') on determination of water requirements for a number of crops including sugarcane. Two process-level models, APSIM and CANEGRO are being used to support various decisions regarding the use of irrigation in sugarcane. The aims of this research were to confirm or otherwise refine FAO 56 crop coefficients for sugarcane, to refine simulation of water use in the APSIM-Sugarcane model and to assess the reference evapotranspiration (ET) procedure from the CANEGRO model now used in Swaziland for irrigation scheduling and system design. Bowen ratio energy balance (BREB) systems were installed in the Burdekin district, Australia and in Swaziland to determine daily ET from well-irrigated sugarcane crops. Automatic weather stations were installed within I km of the BREB systems in order to determine ET0 according to FAO 56. Radiation interception and biomass accumulation were measured in the Australian experiment. The results from the two countries provided a sound basis for confirmation of the current FAO 56 crop coefficients for sugarcane during 'initial' (0.4) and 'mid' (1.25) growth phases. The FAO 56 crop coefficient for the 'final' stage (0.7) was not supported. Instead a value of 1.25 is suggested for working out the water balance. However, 0.7 may be desirable for irrigation scheduling in order to impose some stress on the crop and so enhance sucrose content. Transpiration use efficiency for A-PSIM-Sugarcane was increased from 8.0 to 8.7 g kPa kg(-1) on the basis of the Australian results. The reference ET procedure was supported equally by the new BREB measurements in Swaziland and by the original lysimeter data but the new data indicated that systematic improvements to the reference procedure could be made.

DE world-class excellence; the Analects of Confucius; corporate culture;
   SAE 8C Corporate Culture Model; SAE 6C self-actualisation engine
AB Taking a macroperspective of world-class organisation, one can easily trace the corporate culture that develops within the enterprises and their employees. Corporate culture is indeed the soul of an organisation. It was suggested by scholars that the actual reason accounting for the prosperity of an organisation does not lie in its tough management program or management tools, but in their cultural elements rooting in an organisation and its distinctive corporate culture. In exploring the reasons for the prosperity of an organisation, these aspects are always being reviewed. How can organisations fully inspire the passion of all employees and deploy their strengths and talents? What the organisations would do to assist employees in pursuing their career path? In order to survive and thrive, organisations, independent of their sizes, should form their own beliefs, values and work ethics. They also should have a common platform for understanding of their employees, customers and business partners.
   In 1989, SAE moved their operation into China, the Guangdong Province, Dongguan City to set up its manufacturing facility. SAE started from scratch at a unique place with different culture, values, beliefs, perspectives, society system, norms etc. Facing the new environment and challenges, the staff did not show any sense of being strangers psychologically: on the contrary, they possessed high confidence in operating the new facility and were committed to building a world-class operation.
   This paper presents the SAE 8C Corporate Culture Model (concern, communication, consensus, co-operation, commitment, control, creativity and contribution) which has a strong base of the ancient Chinese wisdom of The Analects of Confucius. This SAE 8C Corporate Culture Model influences the employee step-by-step in a progressive way and it basically has four levels: infancy, childhood, adulthood and parenthood level. In an effort to maintain sustainable superiority over the rivals in the marketplace, another add-on self-initiated continuous benchmarking process: SAE 6C self-actualisation engine (committed, combative, concentrated, crazy, creative, and champion) is launched for further self-advancement.

AB We examined tree growth and dynamics of organic matter and soil nutrient pools annually for 7 years under contrasting harvest residue management treatments in south-western Australia. Two second rotation Eucalyptus globulus sites were established on soils of contrasting fertility and productivity. Harvest residues were either (i) burnt, (ii) removed, (iii) retained, or (iv) retained at double the normal quantity. More than 31 and 51 Mg ha(-1) of harvest residues resulted from harvesting of 8-year-old first rotation stands at a low fertility Grey Sand site, and a higher fertility Red Earth site, respectively. Harvest residue retention increased tree growth at the lower fertility Grey Sand site, but had no effect on plantation productivity at the Red Earth site up to 7 years. Burning resulted in a direct loss of most of the organic material, and up to 200, and 350 kg ha(-1) of N at the Grey Sand and Red Earth sites, respectively. Significant quantities of organic material in harvest residues (>50 Mg ha(-1) C in the double residues treatment at the Red Earth site) had a limited effect on soil C pools during the 7 years of this study. Retention of residues limited immediate losses of nutrients, and resulted in higher quantities of soil exchangeable K, Ca and Mg during the 7 years after establishment. However, the content of soil exchangeable cations, especially K, decreased during the first 4 years of establishment in all treatments, including those where residues were retained. After 4 years, cation quantities in soil started to increase again, probably due to the decomposition of leaves and twigs from litterfall. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB This study presents a capillary-pressure saturation (P-C-S) constitutive model that incorporates the capillary phenomena necessary for simulating the spatial distribution of nonwetting fluid migrating in a saturated porous medium. To develop a model validation data set, a sequence of dense, nonaqueous phase liquid (DNAPL) pools were emplaced, under alternating drainage and imbibition conditions, in a one-dimensional, 1 m tall, saturated sand pack. A light transmission/image analysis system successfully distinguished between connected-phase and residual nonwetting fluid in the apparatus, thereby permitting the accurate measurement of DNAPL pool heights. These heights are found to depend on the nonzero capillary pressure across the fluid-fluid interface at the top of the pool. The terminal pressure is demonstrated to be the minimum sustainable capillary pressure in connected-phase nonwetting fluid experiencing imbibition, below which residual is formed. Additional bench-scale experiments demonstrate that a nonwetting phase pool will penetrate an underlying capillary barrier when the entry pressure is exceeded and that the resulting infiltration will terminate when the capillary pressure at the barrier reduces to the terminal pressure. At the macroscopic scale the terminal pressure corresponds to the extinction saturation (i.e., zero nonwetting phase flow) at the inflection point on the imbibition P-C-S curve. A ratio of terminal to entry pressure of approximately 0.6 is found to apply at both bench and macroscopic scales and to be independent of porous media and fluid properties. The developed P-C-S constitutive model, which extends the Brooks-Corey function to incorporate the terminal pressure, successfully predicted the behavior observed in the laboratory experiments. Constitutive models that do not incorporate both an entry and a terminal pressure, such as those based upon the standard van Genuchten function, are demonstrated to be unable to predict the observed equilibrium DNAPL pool heights in homogeneous media or above capillary barriers.

AB Particulates (ashes) arising from the burning of crop residues are potentially effective adsorbents for pesticides in agricultural soils. To determine the long-term adsorptive sustainability of ashes, a wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) ash was aged under environmentally relevant conditions (in CaCl2 solution at room temperature and pH 7) in soil extract for 1 month and in a soil (1% ash) for a period of up to 12 months. The aged ash and ash-amended soil were used to sorb diuron from water. The diuron sorption was also measured in the presence of atrazine as a competing pesticide. There was no observed microbial impact on the stability of the wheat ash in soil. All isotherms with the ash were nonlinear typed curves, suggestive of the surface adsorption. On a unit mass basis, the ash in soil extract was 600-10000 times more effective than the soil in sorbing diuron. Adsorption of dissolved soil organic matter (DOM) during aging on the ash surfaces reduced the diuron adsorption by 50-60%. Surface competition from the atrazine adsorption also reduced the ash adsorption of diuron by 10-30%. A total of 55-67% reduction in diuron sorption by the ash-amended soil was observed. Due to its high initial adsorptivity, the ash fraction of the aged ash-amended soil contributed >50% to the total diuron sorption. Thus, the wheat ash aged in the soil remained highly effective in adsorbing diuron. As crop residues are frequently burned in the field, pesticides in agricultural soils may be highly immobilized due to the presence of ashes.

AB For two decades now, the use of Remote Sensing/Precision Agriculture to improve farm yields while reducing the use of polluting chemicals and the limited water supply has been a major goal. With world population growing exponentially, arable land being consumed by urbanization, and an unfavorable farm economy, farm efficiency must increase to meet future food requirements and to make farming a sustainable, profitable occupation. "Precision Agriculture" refers to a farming methodology that applies nutrients and moisture only where and when they are needed in the field. The real goal is to increase farm profitability by identifying the additional treatments of chemicals and water that increase revenues more than they increase costs and do no exceed pollution standards (constrained optimization). Even though the economic and environmental benefits appear to be great, Remote Sensing/Precision Agriculture has not grown as rapidly as early advocates envisioned. Technology for a successful Remote Sensing/Precision Agriculture system is now in place, but other needed factors have been missing. Commercial satellite systems can now image the Earth (multi-spectrally) with a resolution as fine as 2.5 in. Precision variable dispensing systems using GPS are now available and affordable. Crop models that predict yield as a function of soil, chemical, and irrigation parameter levels have been developed. Personal computers and internet access are now in place in most farm homes and can provide a mechanism for periodically disseminating advice on what quantities of water and chemicals are needed in specific regions of each field. Several processes have been selected that fuse the disparate sources of information on the current and historic states of the crop and soil, and the remaining resource levels available, with the critical decisions that farmers are required to make. These are done in a way that is easy for the farmer to understand and profitable to implement. A "Constrained Optimization Algorithm" to further improve these processes will be presented. The objective function of the model will be used to maximize the farmer's profit via increasing yields while decreasing environmental damage and decreasing applications of costly treatments. This model will incorporate information from Remote Sensing, from in-situ weather sources, from soil history, and from tacit farmer knowledge of the relative productivity of selected "Management Zones" of the farm, to provide incremental advice throughout the growing season on the optimum usage of water and chemical treatments.

AB Systematic reviews of HIV prevention research provide clear evidence that behavioral interventions can influence the sexual behavior of men who have sex with men (MSM). However, if HIV prevention works, why are rates of high-risk sexual behavior increasing among MSM in major European, Australian, Canadian, and U.S. cities? The evidence generated by systematic reviews alone may not provide a clear answer to this question. This is because (a) it is uncertain whether experimental interventions shown to be effective in one setting, place, or moment in time can be repeated successfully in another; (b) we have limited understanding of the processes that underlie the interventions; (c) interventions shown to work in an experimental study may not necessarily be effective in everyday life. To answer the question, we need to be alert to the changing risk environment in which men have sex with other men. We also need to develop a new program of research addressing the transferability, sustainability, and effectiveness of sexual health promotion among MSM. Randomized controlled trials will remain one of the optimal means of evaluating behavioral interventions in such a program. By further strengthening the evidence base, we may identify opportunities for innovative as well as effective HIV prevention initiatives.

TI Controlling residential water demand in Qatar: An assessment
SO AMBIO
LA English
DT Article
AB Qatar has serious water resource problems, following rapid socioeconomic development and massive population increase. Municipal water provision depends on costly and unsustainable desalination. There is little regulation. Native Qataris do not pay a water tariff and migrants pay a subsidized price-approximately one third of the cost of production-so there is little awareness of the true cost of water and use is profligate. This paper discusses trends in water use and identifies issues underlying sustainable water use in Qatar. A questionnaire of respondents chosen to represent Qatari social groups measured awareness and attitudes to water. The results show that previous efforts to control water demand in Qatar, using awareness campaigns, legal restrictions and tariffs, have been ineffectual. The questionnaire evaluated reactions to possible measures to limit uses by raising awareness, using legal restrictions and raising tariffs. From this, a number of policy changes can be suggested, to bring Qatar's water industry towards sustainability.

TI Excess capacity and asymmetric information in developing country

SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS

ID PLANT-CAPACITY; EFFICIENCY
AB Excess capacity poses a problem in many developing country fisheries. These countries often pursue a development strategy aimed at expanding capacity under open access. Sustainable development, however, requires management. Principal-agent issues from asymmetric information between the regulator and fishers, which potentially form serious obstacles to fisheries management, arise in the likely forms of management. This article discusses principal-agent issues and examines the principal-agent moral hazard issue, which is due to divorce of ownership and vessel operations. The article also illustrates a method for estimating capacity when information is limited. The Peninsular Malaysian purse seine fishery forms a case study.

AB Eastern collared lizards (Crotaphytus collaris collaris) on the Ozark Plateau of southern Missouri are restricted to islands of rocky glade habitat located throughout the oak-hickory forests of the region. Human mediated suppression of fire negatively impacts collared lizard populations by permitting the overgrowth and consequent disappearance of this glade habitat and also leads to a dense forest understorey that impedes movement of lizards between glades. We present data examining the effects of a fire management regime on collared lizard populations we monitored via mark/recapture from 1998 to 2001. We demonstrate increased glade-to-glade dispersal, colonization of previously unoccupied glades, and a significant increase in population size in the burned area. In addition, we show that populations within burned areas exhibit body sizes similar to those reported for populations living on healthy habitat as compared to those living on habitat that has deteriorated because of fire suppression. We conclude that managed forest fires positively impact collared lizard populations in the Ozarks, promoting factors that increase the long-term sustainability of the species.

AB The vicuna is mainly used in two ways: wild captured, shorn and returned to the wild; or wild captured and maintained in captivity as part of a programme of sustainable use in the Andes of South America. Farming of wild vicunas has hitherto involved no assessment of their welfare. In this study we measured a set of basic blood parameters in order to characterise baseline values in captivity, and we then characterised adrenal cortical responsiveness using an ACTH challenge. The ACTH challenge is widely used for assessing neuroendocrine responses to stress and is now increasingly being applied to studies of wild animals' welfare. Five male vicunas were injected with exogenous ACTH and their responses compared with those of a control group injected with placebo. Behavioural and haematological changes were monitored. Injection of ACTH produced a 4.5-fold increase in cortisol concentration within 1 h. Total white blood cell count almost doubled in less than 5 h. The neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio also changed, with a decrease in lymphocytes and an increase in neutrophils, suggesting that the neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio was affected by the ACTH challenge. Packed cell volume increased from 40% to 44%. Observations of individual vicunas during sampling revealed no discernible behavioural differences between treated and control animals; however, animals that had higher initial baseline cortisol concentration made more attempts to escape, and vocalised more during handling, regardless of whether they were treated with ACTH or placebo. The results reveal the different blood parameter levels associated with stress in different species and highlight the hazard of interpreting stress levels in one species on the basis of measures calibrated in another. We provide calibrated reference values for future studies of stress in vicunas.

AB A current programme of wildlife utilisation in the Andean region involves the capture of wild vicunas, their shearing, transport and, in some cases, captive farming. The effects of these interventions on the physiology, and thus welfare, of wild vicunas are unknown. As a first step to quantifying and thus mitigating any adverse welfare consequences of this harvest, we measured the immediate and longer-term physical and physiological effects of capture, shearing and transport. A sample of juvenile male vicunas was captured Six were shorn at the capture site, six after two weeks in captivity, and the remaining seven animals were kept as controls for 39 days. In general, vicunas showed changes in blood glucose, packed cell volume, cortisol, and neutrophil: lymphocyte ratios within 4-6 h following capture. Creatine kinase was also affected by capture and transport, showing a peak plasma level 24 It after capture, which was followed by a peak plasma level of aspartate aminotransferase four days after capture and transport. After 12 days in captivity, all of the vicunas showed physiological parameters close to expected baseline values for the species. We could detect no differences it? physiological parameters between animals that were captured, sheared and transported and those that were only captured and transported. Similarly, we could detect no differences in most responses of vicunas between those sheared after 12 days, in captivity and a control group held under similar conditions but from which blood was sampled without shearing. A further comparison between animals sheared immediately after capture and animals sheared after 12 days in captivity revealed that creatine kinase levels were higher in the former group. During transport prior to release back into the wild, only minor injuries (lip bleeding and limb contusions) and a significant increase in rectal temperature were observed Our results provide a basis for recommendations to improve the welfare of vicunas during the wool hat-vest, and provide baseline and stress-response data to serve as reference points for further studies of vicuna welfare.

DT Article
ID AIRWAY HYPERRESPONSIVENESS; INFLAMMATION; IGE
AB Background: Previous reports show that addition of omalizumab to standard therapy reduces asthma exacerbations and simultaneously decreases use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) and rescue medication in patients with allergic asthma.
   Objective: To determine the effect of omalizumab on long-term disease control in patients with severe allergic asthma.
   Methods: The present study concerns the 24-week, double-blind extension phase to a previous 28-week core study in which patients received subcutaneous omalizumab or matching placebo (at least 0.016 mg/kg/IgE [IU/mL] every 4 weeks) for 16 weeks in addition to their existing ICS therapy (beclomethasone dipropionate [BDP]; steroid-stable phase), followed by a 12-week phase in which controlled attempts were made to gradually reduce ICS therapy (steroid-reduction phase). During the extension phase patients were maintained on randomized treatment (omalizumab or placebo) and the lowest sustainable dose of BDP. The use of other asthma medications was permitted during the extension phase. Investigators were also allowed to switch patients from BDP to other ICS medications if considered necessary.
   Results: A total of 460 patients (omalizumab, n = 245; placebo, n = 215) entered the extension phase. Overall, omalizumab-treated patients experienced significantly fewer exacerbations vs placebo during the extension phase (0.60 and 0.83 exacerbations per patient, respectively; P = 0.023), despite a sustained significant reduction in their use of ICS (mean BDP equivalent dose: omalizumab, 227 mug/d; placebo, 335 mug/d; P < 0.001). Treatment with omalizumab was well tolerated and the incidence of adverse events was similar in both treatment groups.
   Conclusions: These results indicate that omalizumab is effective in the long-term control of severe allergic asthma.

AB The sustainable use of wildlife resources within community-based programmes is considered as a valuable option to enhance development and conservation objectives. The application of such a concept in communal lands requires the strong support of local communities through their active involvement in wildlife management. Precise and regular information on wildlife abundance is also essential for effective conservation. In this paper, we present an innovative participatory monitoring method based on bicycle counts developed within the framework of an integrated conservation and development project in the Zambezi Valley, Zimbabwe. Results from the 1999 count of population density and structure of common species as well as diversity of large to medium size species are presented. We demonstrate the efficiency of this method, which allowed a high census intensity with efficient animal detection, and hence appeared appropriate for use in a non-protected area. The method gave high levels of precision for the density estimates obtained (10-30% cv) and is therefore useful as a repeatable monitoring tool. In addition, this method is inexpensive to run and is easy to implement for local people. We emphasise the technical and financial autonomy offered by the bicycle counts for communities to monitor their wildlife resources, and we discuss the contribution of this method to the wildlife management process.

AB A floristic survey has been carried out in a peri-urban forest, the Sonian Forest in Brussels, to identify indicator plant species in the herbaceous layer, which could be used as an aid within the framework of a more sustainable management of the forest. Three hundred and seventy two (372) taxa have been identified, 33 of which are non-native (i.e. non-indigenous species regarding the study area, whether invasive or not). Criteria of habitat quality that have been chosen are the species richness, the commonness of the habitat, based on constitutive species, and its invasibility (vulnerability for invasion). On the basis of a comparison of the value of these criteria when each considered (potential indicator) species is present or not, 17 species have been recognised as reliable indicators of at least one of these three criteria. In particular, vegetation types containing either Anthriscus sylvestris, Galeopsis tetrahit or Senecio ovatus were found to be more susceptible to invasion than other habitats. The way to how the predictability of invasions might be effectively used as a management tool is discussed. Furthermore, we found a positive significant correlation (Bonferroni corrected probabilities) between the species richness and luminosity factor (derived from Ellenberg's indices), and the proportion of grassland and wetland species. The species richness was significantly negatively correlated with the proportion of woodland species. An increase in commonness was significantly correlated with a decrease in the proportion of geophytes. The usefulness of these results as an ecological basis for forest management is discussed.

AB The present study was conducted in five villages around the Nazinga Game Ranch, Burkina Faso. Fifty informants of the Gourounsi ethnic group were used. Eighty-one useful woody species were identified, out of a total of 110 woody species in the area. Woody plant use was quantified as: edible fruits (28 species), vegetable sauce (22 species), firewood (33 species), construction (29 species) and medicine (64 species and 167 remedies). Further, species accumulation curves were used to estimate that more than 650 remedies for medicine are used in the area. The community's knowledge of plants was analysed in relation to age, gender, village of residence and amount of intercultural visits. The knowledge pattern was remarkably uniform, with only two variations: (1) men generally identified more edible fruit trees than women, and (2) one village reported more firewood species than the other four villages. The informants had a variety of opinions concerning the availability of useful plants, but the majority found the availability to be fine and 47% of the informants searched for useable products in the savanna on a daily basis. No correlation was found between an informant's impression of useful products availability and his / her frequency of visits into the savanna. The results show that the Gourounsi people live in intimate relation with the savanna surrounding their villages. They are aware of the environment and are willing to learn and adopt new conservation practices.

AB Lake Victoria is Africa's single most important source of inland fishery production. After it was initially fished down in the first half of the 20th century, Lake Victoria became home to a series of introduced food fishes, culminating in the eventual demographic dominance of the Nile perch, Lates niloticus. Simultaneously with the changes in fish stocks, Lake Victoria experienced dramatic changes in its ecology. The lake fishery during most of the 20th century was a multispecies fishery resting on a diverse lake ecosystem, in which native food fishes were targeted. The lake ended the century with a much more productive fishery, but one in which three species-two of them introduced-made up the majority of the catch. Although many fish stocks in Lake Victoria had declined before the expansion of the Nile perch population, a dramatic increase in the population size of Nile perch in the 1980s roughly coincided with the drastic decline or disappearance of many indigenous species. Now, two decades after the rise of Nile perch in Lake Victoria, this species has shown signs of being overfished, and some of the native species that were in retreat-or even thought extinct-are now reemerging. Data on the resurgence of the indigenous species suggest that heavy fishing of Nile perch may enhance biodiversity; this has spawned renewed interest in management options that promote both fishery sustainability and biodiversity conservation.

TI Assertive outreach teams in London: Staff experiences and perceptions -

DT Article
ID MENTAL-HEALTH STAFF; JOB-SATISFACTION; COMMUNITY; BURNOUT; STRESS
AB Background The job satisfaction, burn-out and work experiences of assertive outreach team staff are likely to be important to the model's sustainability.
   Aims. To describe self-reported views and workexperiencesofstafF in London's 24 assertive outreach teams and to compare these with staff in community mental health teams (CMHTs) and between different types of assertive outreach team.
   Method. Confidential staff questionnaires in London's assertive outreach teams (n=187, response rate = 89%) and nine randomly selected CMHTs (n = 14, response rate = 75%).
   Results. Staff in assertive outreach teams and CMHTs were moderately satisfied with their jobs, with similar sources of satisfaction and stress. Mean scores were low or average for all subscales the Maslach Burnout Inventory for the assertive outreach team and the CMHT staff, with some differences suggesting less burn-out in the assertive outreach teams. Nine of the 24 assertive outreach teams had team means in the high range for emotional exhaustion and there were significant differences between types of assertive outreach team in some components of burn-out and satisfaction.
   Conclusions. These findings are encouraging, but repeated investigation is needed when assertive outreach teams have been established for longer.

AB The proposal that plasma ammonia accumulation might impair the swimming performance of fish was first made over a decade ago, and has now proven to be the case for a number of salmonid species. The first experimental evidence was indirect, when a negative linear relationship between plasma ammonia concentrations and maximum sustainable swimming speed (U-crit) was found following the exposure of brown trout (Salmo trutta) to sub-lethal concentrations of copper in soft acidic water. Since then, negative linear relationships between plasma ammonia concentration and U-crit have been demonstrated following exposure of brown trout, rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) to elevated water ammonia. For brown trout, the relationships between plasma ammonia and U-crit were remarkably similar following either exposure to elevated water ammonia or to sub-lethal copper. This indicates that the impairment of swimming performance resulting from exposure to sub-lethal concentrations of heavy metals may be attributable in large part to an accumulation of endogenous ammonia. The negative relationship between plasma ammonia concentration and U-crit was similar in size-matched rainbow and brown trout but, under similar regimes of ammonia exposure, rainbow trout were able to maintain a significantly lower plasma ammonia concentration, revealing inter-specific differences in ammonia permeability and/or transport. One primary mechanism by which ammonia accumulation may impair exercise performance is a partial depolarisation of membrane potential in tissues such as the brain and white muscle. This may prejudice the co-ordination of swimming movements and reduce or abolish the development of muscle tension, thus, compromising swimming efficiency and performance at the top end of the range.

AB The sand-dunes of Quiberon was chosen as a pilot site to investigate experimentation in conservatory management. Sand burial is necessary to conserve the semi-fixed dune which is a transitory dynamic stage. In the fixed dune, low disturbances benefit the vegetation diversity while heavy ones create serious injury. An opening of the milieu can restore very fast but a naked substrate is difficult to heal. The deposition of gorse branches is then efficient to facilitate the restoration. The fixed dune biodiversity is linked to human activities. Disturbances, natural or not, may be used as management tools. (C) 2003 Academie des sciences. Published by editions scientifiques et medicales Elsevier SAS. All rights reserved.

AB The publication of the Antihypertensive and Lipid-lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT) results, when used in conjunction with a new meta-analysis, provides hypertension research with a watershed. Data demonstrate clearly that lowering blood pressure is the most important aspect of hypertension management, and that all agents are similarly effective. There is little sustainable evidence for pressure-independent advantages for any class,of drug at this time. Therefore, by combining these findings with additional information on target levels of blood pressure. and safety, plus the use of aspirin and statins, we can formulate health care policies that attack hypertension in a holistic risk-based way. The future will focus on gaining extra benefit for patients by testing the efficacy and superiority of drug combinations using novel agents that favorably influence intermediate markers such as arterial stiffness, and arresting the ever-increasing burden of cognitive impairment and dementia.

AB The paper highlights the need to understand and recognize the importance of achieving sustainable and efficient industrial water use to meet the ever-growing socioeconomic needs of an expanding industrialization. It addresses the issues such as integration of desalination into a national water management plan, growing national and international pressures to reduce the environmental damage associated with liberal water consumption and the need for greater efficiency in industrial water use in order to reduce costs, enhance competitiveness and conserve water resources. The paper presents analyses of the results from strategic responses of a comprehensive survey of the Libyan water utilization efficiency problem in the industrial sector and suggests solutions using eight themes and 16 issues to highlight the main problems, critical issues, feasible solutions, and possible policy approaches to dealing with them. The results from a limited case study in Libya demonstrates that there is a need to improve both task-oriented and self-oriented behavior through intensive training using work-place-based National Vocational Qualifications (NVQ), such as the NVQ in the UK. A need to develop a strategy to integrate desalination into the national water management plan is also indicated. Many of the problems discussed are common to other countries in the Middle Eastern and North African (MENA).

AB The proposed manuscript contains a techno-economic evaluation of a triple hybrid desalination scheme using systemic methodology. According to the systemic approach the system, has been represented as a set of submodels of various hierarchy levels. There are three groups of models underlying the system, they are: (a) models describing power-generating technology; (b) model describing RO-desalination, and (c) models describing MSF desalination. Any group of individual models, in turn, consists of a set of submodels of different hierarchy levels, they are: (1) technological submodel, (2) fuel or energy submodel, (3) ecological submodel and (4) economic submodel. A load-dependent cost of thermal and electrical energy produced by a power generating system and consumed by RO and MSF is considered in the study. The manuscript contains a set of calculated projections for the cost of water produced by RO and MSF within the triple scheme. The manuscript contains the analysis of the behavior at various technological parameters and economic assumptions such as load, specific fuel consumption, cost of primary energy and carbon tax. Upon calculated results the following conclusions have been drawn: (1) A decrease of the load of a power generating system from 100 to 20% will increase the water cost from $0.94/m(3) to $1.27/m(3) and from $0.69/m(3) to $0.87/m(3), desalted by MSF and RO respectively; (2) Growth of cost of primary fuel from $1/GJ to $4/GJ will increase the water cost from $0.94/m(3) to $1.37/m(3), and from $0.69/m(3) to $0.82/m(3) of water desalted by MSF and RO respectively. The array of calculated data and projections is attached.

AB Nuclear desalination could provide a viable and sustainable option for the supply of energy and freshwater. A number of nuclear desalination systems have already been established and proved to be reliable. Indeed, recent experience in several Asian countries (e.g., China, India, Japan, and Pakistan) demonstrates a potential for a promising future for large-scale construction and operation of nuclear desalination complexes in and and semi-arid coastal regions around the world. This paper evaluates possible schemes for multi-stage distillation (MSF) integrated nuclear desalination plants. The MSF desalination system was chosen because of the much larger field experience in design, construction, and operation than for other thermal desalination options (e.g., multi-effect distillation and vapor compression processes). In fact, MSF plants account for over 70% of all seawater desalination plants around the world. The schemes analyzed in this study include MSF combined with either heating nuclear reactors or nuclear power plants. The study also includes a review of existing nuclear desalination plants. The review focuses on MSF nuclear desalination cost in comparison with similar cogeneration fossil fuel plants. A case study for an MSF nuclear desalination complex with 12 MSF plants (each with a capacity of 7.2 migd or 32,000 m(3)/d) is also presented for the two options of a heating nuclear reactor and a nuclear power plant.

AB Nuclear energy seawater desalination is a unique technology for the production of freshwater - especially potable water - on a large scale without contributing to greenhouse gases, SOx or NOx etc., which use existing nuclear power plant (NPP) technology and seawater desalination technology. The scarcity of freshwater and especially potable water is jeopardizing many regions of the world. It is estimated that about three-quarters of the world's population may suffer from high or moderate water shortages, with a focus on North Africa, the Middle East, Latin America and South-east Asia. The clean development mechanism (CDM) creates a unique, market-based means by which signatories to the Kyoto Protocol, who are required to comply with emission limitations, can work with developing partners in achieving global reductions in greenhouse gases, while promoting those partners' sustainable development by providing financial and technology assistance. In essence, CDM creates a means for transferring the credit for reducing emissions from projects in developing countries to the sponsors of those projects in developed states. A comparative economic analysis of nuclear seawater desalination was carried out under the CDM. The results were calculated by a desalination economic evaluation program (DEEP2.0) developed by the International Atom Energy Agency which included a pressurized light water reactor (PWR), a pressurized heavy water reactor (PHWR), a combined cycle gas turbine (CC) and an open cycle gas turbine (GT), in a middle scale of about 600 MWe, and two desalination technologies: reverse osmosis (RO) and multi-effect distillation (MED). The CDM in nuclear seawater desalination cases was realized in quantitative terms, which are carbon taxes of roughly $40-80/t (of carbon), whose sum is equivalent to the annual total thermal production of nuclear power plants on the same scale as coal-fired plants. The calculated results indicated a significant economics benefit for nuclear seawater desalination.

DE strategy; reverse osmosis; water shortage
AB Desalination became a strategic option in the scarce-water countries, in general and in Palestine, in particular. Its cost competes with the costs of other non-conventional water resources such as wastewater reuse and groundwater recharge. The paper focuses on the Gaza Strip as the study area. Water resources in Gaza Strip suffer from deficit in the water balance of about 30%. From an environmental view, desalination has less negative impact compared to other solutions. It can participate in a significant role in the sustainability of the water resources. Various types of desalination plants in use are discussed. Technical and economical aspects of the various plants are considered. Special attention is given to the reverse osmosis (RO) plants. Although the cost of desalination is still relatively expensive for our case in the Gaza Strip, reverse osmosis desalination is strongly recommended and considered as a strategic alternative in order to overcome the water deficit and meet the future needs of desalination for the Strip. In addition and as part of the strategy, the power consumption of RO systems in Gaza Strip shall be optimized with the Global power consumption and capacity of the power plant under construction.

ID OPTIMIZATION MODEL
AB The present approach has a two-fold emphasis. On one hand, water supply options are modeled and the optimal combination is presented through the identification of the least cost water supply scheme. On the other hand the results may be used towards the delineation of sustainable environmental policy options, particularly in the vulnerable system of small islands. Hence an optimization model has been developed that minimizes the Net Present Value (NPV) of water supply projected costs for the period 2002-2030 for Paros Island, Greece. The non-linear generalized reduced gradient method is used, taking the capacity of water supply options as the decision variable. The model incorporates the operation of groundwater wells and boreholes, surface storage reservoirs, conventional and wind-powered desalination and water hauling by ships. Finally, it estimates the monthly water production as well as the water supply costs. The identified solution involves the combined use of all water supply options and may provide the optimal contribution of each one of the supply sources, on a monthly time step. The results indicate that conventional water supply topped by versatile desalination schemes used for the particularly demanding water consumption peaks may be the focal area of responses for the island of Paros, and by extension for other areas around the world facing similar problems.

AB Increased water demand from population and economic growth, environmental needs, change in rainfall, flood contamination of good quality water and over abstraction of groundwater are all factors that will continue to create water shortage problems around the world. This paper considers alternative solutions, which conform to sustainable solution premises whilst being economically beneficial to island communities. Case studies are described that demonstrate solutions including the benefits of proven hydrogeological expertise, water resource management in very poor developing, regions, cash crop production by reusing brackish municipal wastewater and reuse for industry.

AB The aim of this paper is to assess the role of greywater reuse in sustainable water management in and regions. Moreover, it intends to document the experience of greywater reuse in Jordan. Greywater (GW) is the water collected separately from sewage flow that originates from clothes washers, bathtubs, showers and sinks, but does not include wastewater from kitchen sinks, dishwashers, or toilets. Dish, shower, sink, and laundry water comprise 50-80% of residential wastewater. GW is used in groundwater recharge, landscaping, and plant growth. A case study on GW reuse in Jordan is presented to shed some lights on its role in sustainable water management. To operationalize this concept, water is viewed as an economic good and a finite resource that should be valued and managed in a rational manner. The study concluded that current environmental policies should aim to control pollution and to maximize recycling and reuse of GW within households and communities. Decentralized GW/wastewater management offers more opportunities for maximizing recycling opportunities.

AB Information about the demography of declining species is especially relevant to their conservation and future recovery. Knowledge of survival rates and population size can be used to assess long-term viability and population trends, both of which are of interest to conservation biologists. We used capture-recapture techniques to study the demography of Mountain Plovers (Charadrius montanus Townsend) in southern Phillips County, Montana, USA, in 1995-2000. We used the robust design to estimate annual survival conditional capture (p and r) and recapture (c) probabilities, and the annual population, size (N) in the presence of temporary emigration. The results support age-specific differences in annual survival that are a function of juvenile body mass And. are correlated with the area occupied by. prairie dogs. Body mass had a positive effect on juvenile survival, the slope coefficient for the additive effect of body mass on juvenile survival was 0.77 (95% CI = 0.25, 1.28) on a logit scale. A measure of plover habitat (the area occupied by prairie dogs) appeared to have no effect on survival; the slope coefficient for the additive effect of area occupied by prairie dogs on survival was -0.00004 (95% ci = -0.00003, -0.0001) on a logit scale. Estimated annual apparent survival rates were 0.46-0.49 for juveniles and 0.68 for,adult plovers. Using these estimates, the life span of a Mountain Plover was 1.92 +/- 0.17 years (mean 1 SE) from time of capture as a chick. Resighting rates positively influenced capture probabilities; the slope coefficient for the additive resighting effect was -0.49 (95% ci = -0.86, -0.11) on a logit scale. The size of this adult Mountain Plover population was estimated at 95-180 adults annually. Population size closely tracked annual changes in the area occupied by black-tailed prairie dogs, with both plovers and prairie. dogs rapidly recovering from an outbreak of sylvatic plague in the mid-1990s. Given the low annual survival rates and low mean life expectancy of Mountain Plovers, we conclude that sustainable local populations are currently maintained by annual rates of productivity greater than those for other ground-nesting birds.

AB We are concerned with the management of ecological and economic systems with threshold responses and with several time scales. Although optimal control of such systems is Seldom attainable, the form of such optimal controls provides important insights for more practical schemes. Here we optimize the expected discounted net benefits of phosphorus (P) loadings for a potentially eutrophic lake. The benefits accrue to agricultural interests from activities that result in loading, and costs accrue to other interests from the resulting deterioration of water quality. We extend the 1999 results of S. R. Carpenter, D. Ludwig, and W. A. Brock to account for dependence of P recycling upon the concentration of P in sediments. We obtain optimal policies using methods of dynamic programming with two state variables.
   We find a strong interaction between economic and ecological parameters in determining the optimal policy: the economic discount rate determines whether the time horizon is long or short, and this in turn strongly influences the magnitude of the optimal loadings. Simple policies that neglect dynamics of P in the sediments are inadequate unless the time horizon is short and the dynamics are slow. A stochastic model is essential if there are substantial random fluctuations in loadings. Uncertainty in the determination of the critical P density that triggers recycling cannot be neglected. Our results may be interpreted as a quantitative precautionary principle that takes account of both economic and ecological aspects of the management of the lake. Our results may also be used to illustrate economic ideas such as sustainable development, natural capital, option,values, and income.

AB Sustainability is the objective that many disciplines indicate as being essential to the resolution of environmental degradation, although there is no agreement about what this term exactly means. This study defines environmental problems as externalities, most of these occurring between different generations. We analyze the reasons why traditional solutions for externalities do not work in the intergenerational context. Our conclusions are, on the one hand, that traditional methods for evaluating the costs and benefits affecting different generations should be improved. Secondly, an intergenerational redistribution of natural resource property rights is essential to guarantee equality of opportunities for all generations, and therefore to ensure sustainability. Adequate redistribution of property rights will depend on the type of resource, as well as on other factors such as the rate of return on its exploitation and the current generations' propensity to consume. In all cases, however, sustainability is sufficiently guaranteed by conceding property rights as a whole, to the future. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The reductionist trend of equating sustainable development with sustained economic growth needs to be reversed. New accounts and balances help to operationalize the elusive notion of sustainability: they provide a coherent picture of the interaction between environment and economy. 'Greened' national accounts measure economic sustainability in terms of (produced and natural) capital maintenance; balances of material flows assess ecological sustainability as the dematerialization of production and consumption. Both concepts aim to,preserve environmental assets, but differ in scope, strength and evaluation of sustainability. First results for Germany indicate weak sustainability of the economy; strong sustainability is not in sight because of insufficient reduction of material throughput. Attaining sustainability through integrated policies needs the support of share- and stakeholders of sustainable development. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Economic sustainability is best secured by the creation of local or regional self-reliant, community economies. This is the central argument of eco-local economic theory. Drawing on the experience of local currencies, community corporations, regional food economies and other locally oriented efforts, eco-local theory presents a new analysis of the "economy of place". It focuses on locally symbiotic capital, positive externalities of self-reliance and negative externalities of long-distance trade, and its specific concepts and analyses of the economy, efficiency and economies of scale, and consumption and welfare. Given its specific values and assumptions, it is an economic theory of the social economy that is compatible with, but distinct from, ecological economics. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Discounting future utilities is often justified by the ethically motivated objective of protecting earlier generations from the excessive saving that seems to be implied by undiscounted utilitarianism in productive economies. We question this justification of discounting by showing that undiscounted utilitarianism has sufficient malleability within important classes of technologies: any efficient and non-decreasing allocation can be the unique optimum according to an undiscounted utilitarian criterion for some choice of utility function.

AB Emissions reduction in industrial processes, i.e. clean production, is an essential requirement for sustainable development. Fossil fuel combustion is the main emission source for gas pollutants, such as NOX, SO2 and CO2, and coal is now a primary energy source used worldwide with coal combustion being the greatest atmospheric pollution source in China. This paper analyzes flue gas cleaning by ammonia scrubbing (FGCAS) for power plants to remove gaseous pollutants, such as NOX, SO2 and CO2, and presents the conceptual zero emission design for power plants. The by products from the FGCAS process can be used in agriculture or for gas recovery. Experimental results presented for SO2 removal from the simulated flue gas in a continuous flow experiment, which was similar to an actual flue gas system, showed that the effectiveness of the ammonia injection or scrubbing depends on the temperature. The FGCAS process can effectively remove SO2, but the process temperature should be below 60degreesC or above 80degreesC for SO2 reduction by NH3 scrubbing. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

DE energy policy analysis; top-down and bottom-up; general equilibrium

ID COMPLEMENTARITY-PROBLEMS
AB The impact of energy policy measures is not restricted to the energy system and should therefore be analysed within ail economy-wide framework, while keeping the essential details of the energy sector.
   The aim of this paper is to present new developments in the field of the consistent evaluation of indicators for the sustainability assessment of energy policy measures. Starting from the static concept of Bohringer (Energy Econ. 20 (1998) 233), this paper shows how the complementarity format can be used in computable general equilibrium (CGE) modelling for a dynamic formulation of bottom-up and top-down approach merging models. While a hybrid approach increases the credibility of CGE models in energy policy analysis by replacing the energy sector generic functional forms with a bottom-up activity analysis based on specific technologies, the endogenous formulation of investment decisions makes an explicit description of evolving specific capital stocks and technology mixes possible. Both features are essential when assessing effects of policy measures that may be affected by Structural change-which is typically the case in the long-term assessment of energy policy measures.

AB The groundwater table in the piedmont plain was only about 1-2 m in depth in the 1950s and 1960s, but it lowered dramatically afterwards to about 25-27 m in depth (currently 21-23 m above sea level) due to overpumping of groundwater and drought in the region. This change has adversely affected the sustainable development and food supply of this important agricultural area. The groundwater table at Luancheng Experimental Station of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, located in the piedmont, dropped from 39.36 m in 1975 to 21.47 m above sea level in 1999, at an average rate of 0.72 m/year. Water balance components, such as daily rainfall, pan-evaporation, and evapotranspiration (by lysimeter after 1995) have been recorded since the 1970s, and they were used as variants to simulate monthly water table change based on a physically based statistical model. Groundwater samples were collected during the period 1998-2001, and tritium was measured in the laboratory to trace the groundwater flow from the Taihang Mountains to the piedmont. A reasonable exploitation rate of 150 mm/year was obtained from the model by assuming the annual water table is constant. The recharge and groundwater flow from the Taihang Mountains plays an important role in the water balance of the piedmont area, and it was estimated to be about 112.5 mm/year by using the variation of tritium with the depth, which followed a good exponential function. The simple water balance calculation indicated that the water table could recede at a rate of 0.8 m/year, which is close to the actual situation.

ID ALUMINUM
AB By reducing the energy and materials required to provide goods and services, nanotechnology has the potential to provide more appealing products while improving environmental performance and sustainability. Whether and how soon this potential could be realized depends on phrasing the right research and development (R&D) questions and pursuing commercialization intelligently. A sufficiently broad perspective at the outset is required to understand economic and technical feasibility, estimate life cycle environmental implications, and minimize unanticipated negative impacts. The rapid rise in federally funded nanotechnology R&D dictates that consideration of societal benefits will have a large role in setting the R&D agenda. We estimate potential selected economic and environmental impacts associated with the use of nanotechnology in the automotive industry. In particular, we project the material processing and fuel economy benefits associated with using a clay-polypropylene nanocomposite instead of steel or aluminum in light-duty vehicle body panels. Although the manufacturing cost is currently higher, a life cycle analysis shows potential benefits in reducing energy use and environment discharges by using a nanocomposite design.

AB When people use a resource without a co-ordinated plan the result is often a tragedy of the commons in which the resource is depleted. Many environmental resources display the characteristics of a developing tragedy of the commons. Many believe that each person is ethically obligated to reduce use of the commons to the sustainable level. I argue that this is mistaken. In a tragedy of the commons there is no reasonable expectation that individual, voluntary action will succeed. Our obligation is not fruitlessly to reduce individual use, but to support a collective agreement to reduce everyone's use to the sustainable level.

AB This paper presents a historical examination of the influence of the Darwinian metaphor 'the struggle for existence' on a variety of scientific theories which inform our current understanding of the prospects for sustainable development. The first part of the paper traces the use of the metaphor of struggle through two distinct avenues of thought relevant to the search for sustainable development. One of these avenues leads to the biophysical critique of conventional development popularised by 'ecological economists' such as Georgescu-Roegen and Daly. This critique suggests that modem economic systems have gone astray by failing to respect the biological and physical limits to development and that they should be adapted to make them more like ecological systems. The other avenue leads to the modem insights of evolutionary psychology. These latter insights suggest that in certain key respects, the economic system (and actors within it) are already behaving more or less like an ecological system, driven as they are by evolutionary imperatives. Consequently, this second avenue appears to offer far bleaker prospects for achieving sustainable development than the first. However, the final part of the paper re-examines the historical roots of the metaphor itself, and suggests a number of ways in which a critical response to those historical roots might influence our understanding of the prospects for sustainable development.

AB Biodiversity initiatives have traditionally operated within a 'science-first' model of environmental decision-making. The model assumes a hierarchical relationship in which scientific knowledge is elevated above other knowledge systems. Consequently, other types of knowledge held by the public, such as traditional or lay knowledges, are undervalued and under-represented in biodiversity projects.
   Drawing upon two case studies of biodiversity initiatives in Canada, this paper looks at the role that constructivist conceptions of education play in the integration of alternative knowledge systems in environmental decision-making. In so doing, it argues that the conservation, sustainable use and equitable sharing goals outlined by the Convention on Biological Diversity (signed in 1992 under the auspices of the United Nations Environmental Programme) demand new models of governance which embrace the adaptive management qualities of learning organisations.

AB Several interrelated factors affect water quality in the Albemarle-Pamlico Estuarine System (APES) including land use change in the upland and coastal watersheds, legislatively mandated basin-wide nutrient management plans, intense storms, and global and local changes in sea level. Despite its importance as an essential fish habitat, the APES has not been monitored as intensively or extensively for habitat impacts associated with decreased water quality as other estuaries have been, such as with the North Carolina tributary estuaries or Chesapeake Bay. To support the sustainable use of these estuaries, we are developing an automated water quality monitoring system aboard ferries that traverse the APES. This program, FerryMon, provides a unique, long-term, and cost-effective monitoring system to evaluate status and trends in APES water quality Intensive temporal and spatial data obtained from all ferry routes provide an environmental baseline and are used to assess the patterns and variability in surface water hydrography, dissolved constituents, and particulate matter. The data are useful to calibrate estimates of ocean color and sea surface temperature from aircraft and satellite sensors. We are creating a searchable geographic database that is intended for scientists, managers, and the general public. Using ferries as sampling platforms to monitor estuarine water quality is a tractable approach and FerryMon represents a model for use in other large bodies of water traversed by ferries.

AB Numerous studies have concluded that better use of scientific information could improve the quality of coastal and estuarine environmental management. Approaches for effecting such a change include ecosystem-based, integrated, and adaptive management, but such basic re-orientation of estuarine and coastal management has proved difficult to achieve. Even environmental indicators, seemingly straightforward ways of injecting scientific information into decision making, have achieved broad on-the-ground use in relatively few instances-principally the largest estuary management programs. A conceptual framework useful for examining environmental management systems affecting the five PNCERS (Pacific Northwest Coastal Ecosystems Regional Study) estuaries conceives of environmental managers, researchers, and interested and affected parties in the public as interacting through the multi-layered institutional arrangements that currently promote the utilization, management, or protection of coastal and estuarine resources. Considerable variation exists in the approach and effectiveness of the region's environmental management organizations. Interaction between science and management in the region appears to be limited to an extent by high transaction costs; a cultural divide between environmental scientists and environmental managers is perceived by members of both groups who work with the PNCERS estuaries as inhibiting communications between them. Mechanisms that both groups identify as useful for improving the flow of information between science and management are little used, perhaps as a result. The two groups have very different patterns of information dissemination and acquisition, and though both chose agency archives and databases as their top methods for disseminating information, neither group relies much on these vehicles for information they seek. Both residents' and practitioners' perceptions of threats to the PNCERS estuaries show patterns of estuary-to-estuary variation. One theme that emerges is that problems associated with poor land management in adjacent uplands are common to most of these estuaries, potentially providing a sense of commonality through which a more regional approach to estuary management could emerge. A common set of estuarine environmental indicators implemented for all estuaries could help instigate such a regional approach, but resource constraints, especially at the local level, will have to be overcome for that to occur. There is currently substantial lack of common vision among coastal practitioners as to the purpose and desirability of indicators, and relatively little experience or knowledge of their use, particularly at the local level. Use of estuarine science in the management of these estuaries appears to be greatest during periods in which the largest programmatic shifts in environmental management approaches occur, an observation consistent with other studies that have concluded that the use of environmental science in environmental management tends to be episodic.

AB Nutrient fluxes were measured between Fourleague Bay, a shallow Louisiana estuary, and the Gulf of Mexico every 3 h between February 1 and April 30, 1994 to determine how high velocity winds associated with cold fronts and peak Atchafalaya River discharge influenced transport. Net water fluxes were ebb-dominated throughout the study because of wind forcing and high volumes of water entering the northern Bay from the Atchafalaya River. Flushing time of the Bay averaged <8 days; however, more rapid flushing occurred in response to northerly winds with approximately 56% of the volume of the Bay exported to the Gulf in 1 day during the strongest flushing event. Higher nitrate + nitrite (NO(2) + NO(3)), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations were indicative of Atchafalaya River input and fluxes were greater when influenced by high velocity northerly winds associated with frontal passage. Net exports of NO(2) + NO(3), TN, and TP were 43.5, 98.5, and 13.6 g s(-1), respectively, for the 89-day study. An average of 10.6 g s(-1) of ammonium (NH(4)) was exported to the Gulf over the study; however, concentrations were lower when associated with riverine influence and wind-driven exports suggesting the importance of biological processes. Phosphate (PO(4)) fluxes were nearly balanced over the study with fairly stable concentrations indicating a well-buffered system. The results indicate that the high energy subsidy provided by natural pulsing events such as atmospheric cold fronts and seasonal river discharge are efficient mechanisms of nutrient delivery to adjacent wetlands and nearshore coastal ecosystems and are important in maintaining coastal sustainability.

AB Agriculture faces an array of interrelated problems that call for development of new and revision of existing cropping systems towards the multiple needs of the 21st century. Agro-ecological engineering approaches aimed at design and exploration of alternative land use systems at various scales may support the identification of appropriate land use options. Engineering approaches are based on mathematical representations of well-founded agro-ecological principles while taking into account available resources and prevailing land-related objectives. The goal of this paper is to contribute to the development of a formalized approach to engineer cropping systems at the land unit level that can be used as building blocks for systematic explorations of land use options at farm or regional scale. The approach for engineering cropping systems at the land unit level consists of three steps: (i) goal-driven design of cropping systems, (ii) quantification of biophysical production targets and (iii) definition of the optimal mix of inputs required to realize production targets. This paper describes the approach and illustrates it with examples from the Sudano-Sahelian zone of Mali. Explicit attention is paid to the required numerical tools and their application to analyze consequences of uncertainty in the performance of engineered cropping systems. Using numerical tools, uncertainty is made explicit with the aim to better manage or reduce it. Identification of uncertainty at the designer's desk allows taking uncertainty into account before applying engineered land use systems in regional model studies or testing such systems in practice. Problems related to the application of numerical tools are discussed, including the future role of agro-ecological engineering as independent discipline within agricultural science.

TI Looking ahead from the past: The intertemporal sustainability of
   Portuguese finances, 1854-1910
SO EUROPEAN REVIEW OF ECONOMIC HISTORY
LA English
DT Article
AB The history of public finances in Portugal from the middle of the nineteenth century to World War I is distinguished by the pursuit of an ambitious programme of public investment in infrastructure, and by the negative financial consequences this elicited, culminating in the 1892. default. In this article we approach the Portuguese financial history of this period with a relatively new methodology for evaluating financial sustainability, which emphasises the inter-temporal nature of government budgeting. The results obtained allow us to quantify the distance that separated Portuguese finances from a sustainable path throughout the period. Although the generational imbalance of Portuguese finances at the time seems massive in the context of today's benchmarks, its economic and financial impact should have been more limited, given the government's relatively low weight in the economy and the favourable demographic pattern.

AB Background. A number of studies have shown that the communication style of GPs has a significant impact on their ability to recognize and manage psychiatric disorders. Italian training programmes do exist, but none have been evalutated for effectiveness.
   Methods. Nine established GPs participated in a training programme consisting of twelve 3-h education sessions. Each session consisted of group discussion of videotaped patient interviews selected by GPs. Case discussion followed Lesser's 'problem-based approach' criteria. Efficacy of training was assessed by measuring the pre-post change in accuracy in detecting psychiatric illness and changes in the interview skills of the GPs.
   Results. Accuracy in detection of psychiatric illness increased significantly after training. Changes were seen in the interview style after training, such as use of open-ended questions and appropriate counselling in relation to problems presented by the patient. Physicians also improved their management skills by using a more negotiatory style and providing patients with supportive feedback. The way in which physicians gave advice and information to the patients improved significantly despite the fact that GPs were not instructed about how to give information to their patients.
   Conclusions. Group training in problem-based interviewing utilizing video feedback is a robust, culturally transferrable model for improving the skills of established physicians. Our results suggest that training produces indirect effects that are the result of the teaching method rather than of explicit instructions. Further research is required to assess how to optimize the effect of educational interventions to ensure sustainability and maximal impact on measurable outcomes of care.

AB Based on common reclamation practice for lignite-rich and strongly acidic mine spoil soils today lignite-poor sandy mine spoils, which are more favorable for plant growth, are also reclaimed using the same intensive soil improvement measures to establish forest stands. The present study, shows that intensive amelioration measures, e.g. loosening of the Spoil, lit-ning of the substream and application of mineral fertilizers, are not a prerequisite for successful development of pine stands (Pinus sylvestris L.), on these substrata. The success of afforestation on these substrata depends more on the weather conditions after planting than on the soil conditions. In 1996 high temperatures and a long drought period after planting led to high mortality rates among the pine seedlings. Without any fertilization (K) and amelioration with silicate rock powder (W) the mortalin, rate amounted to 40% and 37%, respectively. Thus, amelioration with N-enriched silicate rock powder (RF) increased the mortalin Late to 78% and re-planting was necessary. However, if planting takes place with sufficiently high soil water contents in the rooting zone (1997 and 1998) the mortality rate decreased to 11% on the control (K). Under these climatic conditions soil amelioration (W, RF) led to a mortality rate of up to 63%. Fertilization is not necessary at afforestation. Despite the nutrient poverty of the sandy substratum, nutrient storage in these raw soils is high enough to cover the nutrient demand of the pine seedlings during the first years after planting. Six years after application of silicate rock powder the effect of fertilization is seen in a larger growth as compared to the untreated control and to fertilization with N-enriched silicate rock powder (RFII and RFIII). Both, fertilization with silicate rock powder and N-enriched silicate rock powder led to improved N-, P, K- and Mg-nutrition status of the pine needles compared to the untreated control. Three years after fertilization, N-, and K-concentrations in pine needles are higher compared to NPK-mineral fertilization. With regard to sustainability and from the ecological point of view silicate rock powder can be recommended as an alternative to the traditional reclamation practice of using mineral fertilizers.

AB At the beginning of regular forestry and systematic forest science the focus of sustainable management was on wood production (v. CARLOWITZ 1713, COTTA 1828, HARTIG 1804, HUNDESHAGEN 1826). Subsequently more and more forest functions were considered in management and planning (V. HAGEN 1867, DIETRICH 1957). Our current understanding of multifunctional forest development is reflected in the six Pan-European criteria and corresponding indicators for sustainable forestry (MCPFE 2000). The present paper Outlines how these criteria and indicators can he applied for certification and strategic planning of sustainable development on the level of operational forests and how forest growth and yield science might Support this intention. Forestry in Germany, is blessed with an excellent database gathered during forest inventories and long-term monitoring. For example, we demonstrate how additional use can he made of the database for more efficient extraction Of relevant pan-European criteria and indicators. An important Field of application of this database is monitoring and certification of forest development. The creative power of these criteria and indicators can he unfolded by integrating them in strategic forest planning. For the purpose of strategic planning growth models, simulators and decision support systems are available. If these tools cover the relevant criteria and indicators the they enable multicriteria scenario analysis and optimisation of management options on estate level. Concepts and tools for multicriteria oriented strategic planning are available (v. GADOW 2003, HANEWINKEL 2001, PRETZSCH et al. 1998, SPELLMANN et al. 2001), their transfer into forest management would trigger considerable innovation.

AB The improved catalogue of pan-European criteria and indicators of sustainable forestry allows assessment of conditions and developments on different scales. It represents the diversity of possible targets of a multi functional forestry, which can be structured in a hierarchical system of objectives. Comparisons between actual conditions and objectives provide important information for goal-oriented management. Several options are usually available to reach the specified objectives and can be examined with the help of forest growth models. Especially single tree models are suitable to support strategic decisions in favor of or against special management concepts under consideration of different criteria. Linking of informational data with spatial data in a geographic information system makes it easier to identify compromises between demands of different forest users on a regional level.

AB During recent years, the old scientific discipline "forest management" experienced almost worldwide an unprecedented revival. Numerous original scientific contributions featuring new aspects of sustainable forest management supported by growth, yield and operations research, continue to appear in renowned international journals. Forests are complex open systems with multiple functions and to maintain credibility among the public, forest managers need to draw on the expertise of a variety of scientific disciplines, not only on the humanities, but increasingly also on forest engineering and forest biological sciences. The multi-disciplinary character of forest research can be utilized to achieve a more effective interface between science and politics. The objective of the paper is to present a coherent system of forest management which is suitable for rotation forestry as well as continuous cover forestry. The system includes three elements: a) forest options planning, using specific tools to generate and evaluate silvicultural management options; b) management demonstration and referencing, based on a network of managed and unmanaged field plots and c) forest event analysis, involving preventative evaluation of silvicultural activities based on event-oriented resource assessment.

AB 1. Soil sustainability implies a sufficient diversity and abundance of organisms to perform soil functions and to resist environmental stress. Previous studies have shown the importance of functional biodiversity for soil organisms.
   2. Soil samples have been collected within the framework of a long-term monitoring programme in the Netherlands. Nematological and microbiological techniques were combined to facilitate a more comprehensive understanding of possible below-ground effects of land management.
   3. A possible bias due to stochastic circumstances was investigated. The Mantel test showed that the diversity at species level is largely related to air temperature, but at genus level the effect of temperature disappears. No direct influence of rainfall on the soil biodiversity was found in our model.
   4. To extrapolate our data to a national level, habitat-response relationships for soil organisms have been derived. Generalized linear models (GLMs) and Monte Carlo simulation allowed the estimation of the probability of occurrence at a given abundance for 95 nematode genera.
   5. Our study describes the influence of abiotic conditions and land use intensity on the composition of nematode communities in grasslands on sand. The results obtained reveal a major influence of pH and livestock density on the diversity of the nematode community at both taxonomic levels as well as at different trophic levels (feeding habits). The presence and abundance of soil nematodes decrease with cattle pressure.
   6. Functional diversity decreases with increasing management intensity. It is shown that the Shannon diversities of bacterial feeding nematodes and fungal feeding nematodes are strictly related to cattle pressure, whereas the bacterial biomass occurring under organic farming scores higher than in other farming systems.

AB This paper presents a vision of a desired future of science. In this vision, the future will bring the reintegration of the study of humans and the rest of nature. The barriers between the traditional disciplines will dissolve and a true 'consilience' of all the sciences and humanities will occur. This consilient transdisciplinary science will emerge from a rebalancing of analysis and synthesis, a recognition of the central role of envisioning in science, a pragmatic philosophy built on complex systems theory and modeling, a multiscale approach, and a consistent theory of cultural and biological co-evolution. It will allow us to build a world that is both sustainable and desirable and that recognizes our fundamental partnership with the rest of nature. It is a world that we must first imagine in order to achieve. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB At the dawn of a new millennium, with the past one thousand years ready for reflection and the up-coming one thousand years primed for exciting new adventures, humankind seems to be trapped in the box of myopic, short-term decision making. Voices pleading to expand the horizons of our decision making to ensure sustainability of our species and countless other species on this earth are Currently drowned out by a cacophony of voices trumpeting economic globalization, rapid technology development, and real-time financial markets. While futures decision making is not much in evidence today, the question addressed by this paper is whether futures decision making is even possible. Are there inherent constraints in our ability to make decisions that encompass time frames covering centuries if not millennia? An enormous amount of research has been conducted in the general area of decision making over the past several decades. Much has been learned about the psychology of human decision making and decision making within organizations. Countless methods have been developed to guide decision making. Recent work in areas such as imprecise probability and complex adaptive systems is beginning to provide boundaries as to what can be known about the future. This paper reviews much of this diverse literature and synthesizes important research findings across several disciplines to identify numerous significant barriers to futures decision making. The paper presents several recommendations on how to improve futures decision making in the future. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB One of the most contested dimensions of sustainable development is the issue of substitutability-the extent to which environmental qualities can be substituted, either for human-made assets, or for some equivalent environmental function. The main argument of this paper is that dominant economic discourses of sustainability neglect long-standing geographical concerns with scale, embeddedness and abstraction that are inevitably embroiled in the practical negotiation of substitutability. In particular, it seeks to demonstrate how relations of ecological and political scale frame the 'decision space' within which debates about substitution take place. These arguments are developed by analysing conflicts over the development of an amenity barrage across the Taff-Ely estuary in Cardiff, South Wales, and the provision of new wetlands to compensate for the resulting loss of wildlife habitat. This case shows that the scale at which environmental 'assets' are constructed-whether local, national or global-can reveal or obscure distributive effects incurred in maintaining environmental capital through compensatory measures. It also demonstrates how the re-scaling of governance arrangements (in this case to the European Commission) can empower the delivery of environmental management measures but simultaneously re-structures the objects of sustainability, rendering habitats and wildlife populations as disembedded symbols.

AB There is an increasing global demand for a faster, more expansive development in the energy sector, in order to improve the standard of living of the world's population by the creation of more jobs and better living conditions. The public is, however, well aware of the damage that has been done to the environment, in the form of deforestation, despoiling of lakes and rivers and, in particular, greenhouse effects, and it is unwilling to further sacrifice its natural environment. This decision puts pressure on scientists, engineers and developers to find ways and means of attaining "sustainable energy development". In other words, the challenge now is to achieve the sustainable development of alternative renewable energy resources. Sustainability may be achieved in a number of ways, but the one most likely to result in a rapid increase in energy output without a deleterious impact on the environment is the revamping and integration of what we already have. This paper attempts to address sustainability as it applies to geothermal energy. We describe the concept of a multiple integrated use of geothermal energy, including the tenable benefits that can be obtained from applying this concept, such as a longer reservoir lifespan, a lower specific environmental impact, and greater marketing flexibility and profitability. The paper also emphasises the importance of achieving a maximum effective temperature drop across the application, commensurate with a minimum flow rate, optimal pumping characteristics and minimal fluid extraction from the geothermal reservoir. In geothermal house heating systems this means using large and effective radiators, dual-pipe heating systems, and thermostatic controls on each radiator. Where modifications to existing house heating systems are not feasible, e.g. by conversion from a single-pipe to a dual-pipe system or installation of larger radiators, an alternative solution is to adopt a cascaded flow of the geothermal fluid through a combination of heating systems operating at different temperature levels. For economic reasons it is always better to use the geothermal water directly if its chemical quality permits us to do so, otherwise heat exchangers made of resistant materials will be needed to isolate the geothermal fluid from the heating fluid in order to avoid corrosion or scaling in the pipes and radiators. The heat exchangers should be designed in such a way as to obtain a maximum temperature drop of the geothermal fluid. The paper also describes some heating system configurations, the characteristics of geothermal heating systems and their automatic control systems, as well as recommended geothermal field management and monitoring systems. The paper also includes a few examples of existing projects to demonstrate what has already been achieved and what could be done in the future; some suggestions are also made for new developments and innovations to make geothermal energy more generally attractive and useful worldwide.

AB Geothermal energy is a clean and sustainable energy source, but its development still has some impact on the environment. The positive and negative aspects of this environmental impact have to be considered prior to any decision to develop a geothermal field, as well as possible mitigation measures. The main environmental effects of geothermal development are related to surface disturbances, the physical effects of fluid withdrawal, heat effects and discharge of chemicals. All these factors will affect the biological environment as well. As with all industrial activities, there are also some social and economic effects. In Iceland an enforcement program was launched in the early 1990s to study the environmental impact of developing geothermal resources. Work began on tackling the environmental issues relative to the high-temperature geothermal fields under development in Iceland. Research was conducted on microearthquake activity in geothermal areas and a methodology developed for mapping steam caps. The foundations were laid of networks for monitoring land elevation and gravity changes. Baseline values were defined for the concentrations of mercury and sulfur gases. Groundwater monitoring studies were enforced. Atmospheric dispersion and reaction of geothermally-emitted sulfur gases and mercury were studied. Aerial thermographic survey methods were refined and tested and their capacity to detect and map changes in surface manifestations with time was demonstrated. To further the use of geothermal energy worldwide the International Energy Association set up a Geothermal Implement Agreement (GIA) in 1997; its environmental Annex has been actively implemented, with several projects still under way.

AB Geothermal resources can be considered renewable on the time-scales of technological/ societal systems and do not require the geological times of fossil fuel reserves such as coal, oil, and gas. The recovery of high-enthalpy reservoirs is accomplished at the same site from which the fluid or heat is extracted. Moreover, truly sustainable production can be achieved in doublet and heat pump systems. Generally the environmental impacts of geothermal power generation and direct use are minor, controllable, or negligible. There must be full compliance with environmental regulations, which may vary from country to country. In any case the effects must be monitored and documented (often over long periods), rated and, if necessary, reduced. (C) 2003 CNR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The 250 kW geothermal project at Bad Blumau is the first geothermal project developed in Austria by the private sector following the deregulation of the electricity industry in this country. What makes the project unique besides its private ownership structure is its ability to generate electrical power and district heating for the Rogner Bad Blumau Hotel & Spa by using a low temperature geothermal resource. Installed in the record time of less than a week, the air-cooled ORMAT(R) Energy Converter (OEC) CHP module has been in commercial operation since July 2001. With an annual availability exceeding 99%, between October 2001 and December 2002 the plant delivered 1,560,000 kWh to the local grid. The geothermal CHP module utilizes brine at similar to110degreesC, available from a 3000 m deep production well. Exiting the OEC unit at a temperature of similar to85degreesC, the brine is then fed into the district heating system, providing heat for the Rogner Bad Blumau Hotel & Spa. The geothermal brine is returned from the district heating system and injected into a 3000 m depth reinjection well. The system is a pollution-free, unattended operating power generation module, which has avoided more than 1100 kg Of CO2 emissions over its first operating year.

ID EXTRACTION
AB Geothermal Heat Pumps, or Ground Coupled Heat Pumps (GCHP), are systems combining a heat pump with a ground heat exchanger (closed loop systems), or fed by ground water from a well (open loop systems). They use the earth as a heat source when operating in heating mode, with a fluid (usually water or a water antifreeze mixture) as the medium that transfers the heat from the earth to the evaporator of the heat pump, thus utilising geothermal energy. In cooling mode, they use the earth as a heat sink. With Borehole Heat Exchangers (BHE), geothermal heat pumps can offer both heating and cooling at virtually any location, with great flexibility to meet any demands. More than 20 years of R&D focusing on BHE in Europe has resulted in a well-established concept of sustainability for this technology, as well as sound design and installation criteria. Recent developments are the Thermal Response Test, which allows in-situ-determination of ground thermal properties for design purposes, and thermally enhanced grouting materials to reduce borehole thermal resistance. For cooling purposes, but also for the storage of solar or waste heat, the concept of underground thermal energy storage (UTES) could prove successful. Systems can be either open (aquifer storage) or can use BHE (borehole storage). Whereas cold storage is already established on the market, heat storage, and, in particular, high temperature heat storage (> 50 degreesC) is still in the demonstration phase. Despite the fact that geothermal heat pumps have been in use for over 50 years now (the first were in the USA), market penetration of this technology is still in its infancy, with fossil fuels dominating the space heating market and air-to-air heat pumps that of space cooling. In Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, France and the USA, large numbers of geothermal heat pumps are already operational, and installation guidelines, quality control and contractor certification are now major issues of debate.

AB The geothermal resources of most European countries have been estimated and compiled in the recently published Atlas of Geothermal Resources in Europe, a companion volume to the Atlas of Geothermal Resources in the European Community, Austria and Switzerland. Publication of this Atlas comes at a time when the promotion of a sustainable and non-polluting energy is high on the agenda of local energy suppliers, municipal administrations and all European governments. The participating countries are: Albania, Austria, Belarus, Belgium, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Ukraine and the UK. A volumetric heat content model for porous reservoirs was the basis for calculating the resources, assuming that exploitation of the geothermal resources would take place in a doublet well system. The geothermal reservoirs are defined in a set of 4 maps, by depth, thickness, temperature and resources. The assessment methodology is simple and is based on a small number of parameters so that regions with very limited data coverage can also be evaluated. An example is given in this paper of the eastern North German Basin. The maps presented in the Atlas permit a first order evaluation of the geothermal potential in terms of technical and economic viability. This uniform procedure applied to all countries and regions allows comparisons and serves as a guide for setting priorities and planning geothermal development. This Atlas also helps in the search for appropriate partners for international cooperation in geothermal exploration in Europe. (C) 2003 CNR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB More than loo miles from Bangalore, India, there's a rural area called Kuppam where one in three citizens is illiterate, more than half of the households have no electricity, and there's a high rate of AIDS. Ifs exactly this challenging atmosphere that prompted Hewlett-Packard to choose Kuppam as one of its first "i-communities" initiatives. Through the program, HP creates public-private partnerships to accelerate economic development through the application of technology while simultaneously opening new markets and developing new products and services.
   HP brings to these initiatives the management disciplines of a successful technology business. For example, it unearths customer needs using an iterative cycle that involves prototyping products and services and then closely observing residents' experiences with them. it fields a diversely talented team that brings many skills to the initiative, including deep technical ability, management acumen, and market knowledge. It takes a systems approach, simultaneously examining all the elements that must come together to create a working solution to a given problem. It establishes a "leading platform" on which other players - companies, nonprofits, and government agencies-can build technologies and applications.
   Practices like these help ensure that HP's investment yields real, sustainable results for the community in question. But HP also sees returns to its own business. In Kuppam,the company is discovering the need for (and developing) new products like a solar-powered digital camera, with printer, that fits in a backpack.
   By engaging the community and its leaders and working with them to design valuable new tools and capabilities, HP is gaining the knowledge it needs to be a stronger competitor in other developing regions.

AB Long-term maintenance effects of physical education (PE) curriculum and staff development programs have not been studied. The authors assessed the sustainability of the Child and Adolescent Trial for Cardiovascular Health (CATCH) PE intervention using direct observations of 1,904 PE lessons in former intervention and control schools in four U.S. states 5-years postintervention. Student physical activity levels, lesson contexts, and level of CATCH PE training of teachers were analyzed. Student energy expenditure levels and proportion of PE time in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity in intervention schools were maintained 5 years later, but vigorous activity declined sharply. Meanwhile, postintervention gains in former control schools, influenced by delayed program implementation and secular trends, resulted in a convergence of activity levels in intervention and control schools. Use of CATCH PE curricula was associated with increased levels of teacher training and school support for PE in both former intervention and control schools.

AB Maintenance of the interactive Child and Adolescent Trial for Cardiovascular Health (CATCH) third- to fifth-grade curricula was studied in the 56 original intervention schools and 20 of the original control schools 5 years postintervention in four regions of the United States. Target grade teachers completed a self-administered survey that included questions regarding use of the CATCH materials, training in CATCH or other health education, barriers and perceived support for health education, and amount of health education currently taught. Percentage of teachers who continued to teach CATCH in the classroom was low; however, percentages were significantly higher in former intervention compared with control schools, even though control schools received training and materials following the main field trial. The results of this study can provide useful information for future development of classroom health promotion materials with a higher level of sustainability.

SO HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL

DT Article
DE Bangladesh; urban groundwater; water levels; borehole design
AB This paper focuses on the water-quantity issues facing Dhaka because of the rapid exploitation of the Dupi Tila aquifer. Dhaka is one of the world's largest groundwater-dependent cities, relying on water withdrawn from this underlying semiconfined sand aquifer. A meteoric rise in well construction in both the private and public sectors in recent years has produced an estimated 1,300 boreholes that tap the aquifer in urban and suburban parts of the city. Analysis of construction records for public-supply wells drilled between 1970 and 2000 shows that water levels are falling in several areas of the city despite apparently favorable recharge conditions. The productivity of boreholes as measured by specific capacity has also declined significantly. Even though the aquifer system is vital to the infrastructure of the city it remains a poorly quantified resource, and until this is resolved by investment in evaluation studies, attempts to efficiently manage the resource in a sustainable way will be frustrated.

ID FLUORIDE REMOVAL
AB Within the semiconductor industry, large volumes of hydrogenfluoride (HF) containing wastewaters need to be treated. This paper describes a technique that makes it possible to treat HF wastewater with virtually no waste production. A method based on crystallization of CaF2 on sand particles in a fluidized bed reactor, with trade name Crystalactor, was assessed for the first time with real wastewater originating from a semiconductor prototyping line. Several process parameters were investigated such as influent fluoride concentration, calcium reagent excess, pH, single versus multiple calcium reagent dosing, etc. It can be concluded that the performance of the reactor is greatly dependent on the initial concentrations of calcium and fluoride at the bottom of the reactor (referred to as local saturation). The original hardware design was changed from a single reagent dosing to a multiple reagent dosing to prevent too high local supersaturation values of fluoride and calcium and thus obtain higher CaF2 crystallization efficiencies. Fluoride loads up to 7 kg/m(2.)h were still possible with multiple reagent dosing, compared to a maximum treatable load of 3.5 kg/m(2.)h for single reagent dose. Additionally, an alternative posttreatment process based on replacement of calcite by fluorite in. a granular calcite column is demonstrated.

AB A study was carried out during June 2002 to examine the impact of zero tillage in terms of changes in the cost structure, returns and resource-use efficiency in foothills region of Uttaranchal state of India, one of the major rice (Oryza sativa L.)-wheat(Triticum aestivum L. emend. Fiori & Paol.) pockets of the Indo-Gangetic Plain. The parameters such as yield increase, reduction in cost of production and technical and economic efficiency were used to assess the economic benefits. Determinants of technical efficiency in terms of the adoption of zero-tillage technology and producer characteristics were also examined. Impressive cost savings (28%) was observed under zero tillage in wheat. The technology had positive and significant impact on environment and sustainability of the system through improved soil quality and reduction in use of inputs like chemical fertilizers, irrigation water, and energy. The results showed that education of farmer was the most important factor in achieving resource-use efficiency, while size of holding was the most important influencing factor in adoption of zero-tillage technology. The gains from the adoption of zero-tillage technology could further be improved with enhanced efficiency in resource use and a wider adoption of the technology through appropriate extension programmes.

AB There is a belief that the payoffs from investments in information technology (IT) are difficult to recognize, and therefore a sustained competitive advantage from an IT-enabled strategy is difficult to distinguish from a temporary competitive advantage. We develop a model to test whether market participants are able to recognize a sustained competitive advantage due to an IT-enabled strategy, and test the model empirically. We find that a competitive advantage due to an IT-enabled strategy is discernable by market participants, and as apparent as a competitive advantage obtained through other means.

TI Network applications for group-based learning: Is more better?
SO INTERACTIVE LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS
LA English
DT Article
AB Group-based learning is being introduced into many settings in higher education. Is this a sustainable development with respect to the resources required? Under what conditions can group-based learning be applied successfully in distance education and in increasingly flexible campus-based learning? Can networked support facilitate and enrich courses where group-based learning is applied? These questions formed the basis of the motivation for the research project whose main results are presented here. The goals set for the research were the identification of problems associated with the planning, operationalisation, and monitoring of group tasks in group-based learning in higher education, and the identification of networked support options which, in combination with appropriate instructional decisions, have the potential to remedy these problems. The solutions identified were tested in the context of three case studies.

TI Land liberalisation and sustainable development in Latin America -
   Unravelling the land sales market of Santa Cruz, Bolivia
SO INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT PLANNING REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
AB This article analyses the implications of land liberalisation for sustainable development. More specifically, an effort is made to clarify the functioning of land sales markets in Santa Cruz, Bolivia, and assess the potential of such markets to contribute to poverty alleviation, agricultural development and sustainable land use. It deals with such questions as: Who are the main land dealers, and how do they behave? What are the main patterns of selling or purchase, and what factors determine the dynamics of land transfers? And to what extent does this result in a more equal distribution of the land, and a more efficient (and environmentally less harmful) land use?

TI The search for sustainable transport in a developing city - The case of
   Tianjin
SO INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT PLANNING REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
ID CHINA; SHANGHAI; PATTERNS; BICYCLE
AB With one of the fastest growing economies in the world, China is also experiencing rapid motorisation. While the car industry and the car market are being promoted as spurs to growth, car infrastructure is lagging far behind, with consequent serious problems for traffic management in all large cities. Tianjin represents a significant exception, with a high level of non-motorised traffic, very few dedicated motor vehicle roads and widespread sharing of all other roads by both motorised and non-motorised vehicles. Historical development, urban geography and a variety of city policies explain why Tianjin remains distinct. The operations of this transport system have important effects on the distribution of land uses, the character of streets and patterns of urban life. This article explores how this mixed transportation system works, in particular by examining the potential conflict points between the modes. While relatively high volumes of traffic are accommodated, there is a very low conflict rate. It is argued that there is much to be learned from the Tianjin case for confronting the impending crisis in urban transport in Chinese cities.

ID HUMAN-RESOURCE MANAGEMENT; PERFORMANCE; PRODUCTIVITY; EMPLOYER; SYSTEMS;
   IMPACT; NEEDS
AB Currently, there is general agreement about the importance of training as a tool to help companies in the development of sustainable competitive advantages based on their human resources. However, the investment of companies in training activities is still very low. Among other reasons, that is due to the fact that they do not evaluate the effects of training on performance and therefore they do not know its economic impact for the company. There is also a lack of academic research analysing that issue, mainly at the empirical level. This paper studies empirically the effects of training on performance (effectiveness and profitability) using a sample of 457 European SMEs (including Spanish companies). 1 Our results show some evidence of significant relationships between training and performance.

TI Potential in New Zealand for use of hydrogen as a transportation fuel
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
LA English
DT Article
ID ELECTRIC-POWER REQUIREMENT; LARGE-SCALE PRODUCTION
AB New Zealand imports its vehicle fleet and essentially all transportation fuel. With introduction of fuel-cell vehicles, New Zealand can become self-sufficient in hydrogen fuel. A study undertaken by the Sustainable Energy Initiatives program at UNITEC evaluates the economic and environmental factors of fossil and non-fossil energy sources for production of hydrogen. It examines the transition for hydrogen fuel from on-board production from hydrocarbons to large-scale centralized electrolytic production. The paper extrapolates historic data on population, vehicle transport, and electric energy and examines the basis for introducing hydrogen fuel into the national economy in the 2010-2050 period.

DE international environment health; environment health policy; health and

AB Ultimately, the health and quality of life of all human beings depend upon the environment and ecosystems to which we are directly and indirectly connected. The papers in this special edition address a number of the critical environmental health issues on which U.S. government agencies and their collaborating partners are engaged internationally. The agencies are members of the International Environmental Health Subcommittee, chaired by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The activities described span the range from global policy to country-level field activities. While environmental factors related to infectious disease dominate the global burden of environmentally-related disease, acute and chronic exposures to chemicals are increasingly important public health issues at the local, national, and regional levels; arsenic in drinking water is a good example. Intersectoral action involving governments (at all levels), the private sector, and civil society working together in partnership is absolutely critical to sustainably resolving the problems touched on this overview and meeting the environmental health challenges of the twenty-first century.

AB Nearly half the world's population now lives in urban settlements. Cities offer the lure of better employment, education, health care, and culture; and they contribute disproportionately to national economies. However, rapid and often unplanned urban growth is often associated with poverty, environmental degradation and population demands that outstrip service capacity. These conditions place human health at risk. Reliable urban health statistics are largely unavailable throughout the world. Disaggregated intra-urban health data, i.e., for different areas within a city, are even more rare. Data that are available indicate a range of urban health hazards and associated health risks: substandard housing, crowding, air pollution, insufficient or contaminated drinking water, inadequate sanitation and solid waste disposal services, vector-borne diseases, industrial waste, increased motor vehicle traffic, stress associated with poverty and unemployment, among others. Local and national governments and multilateral organizations are all grappling with the challenges of urbanization. Urban health risks and concerns involve many different sectors, including health, environment, housing, energy, transportation, urban planning, and others. Two main policy implications are highlighted: the need for systematic and useful urban health statistics on a disaggregated, i.e., intra-urban, basis, and the need for more effective partnering across sectors. The humanitarian and economic imperative to create livable and sustainable cities must drive us to seek and successfully overcome challenges and capitalize on opportunities. Good urban planning and governance, exchange of best practice models and the determination and leadership of stakeholders across disciplines, sectors, communities and countries will be critical elements of success.

AB The problem to be analyzed in this article is the following one: How can training be instrumental in developing competence into sustainable competitive advantages? The fundamental belief behind the question is that there is an untapped capability in every business of today, which is knowledge, and it represents a vast potential for gaining sustainable competitive advantage. The article is organized in the following manner: First, we will discuss the role of knowledge and competence in creating sustainable competitive advantages. Secondly, discuss the need for a strategic approach to competence development, by asking the question: "What competencies do we need?". We present a methodology for isolating the competencies that provide sustainable competitive advantages. Third, we discuss the role of training in meeting the strategic competence priorities of companies, by asking: "How should we train to acquire the competence we need". In the conclusion we will present a model for delivering training at the workplace. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Today, businesses have to cope with rapid environmental changes, which are mainly driven by technological innovation. In order to gain a sustainable advantage, they need to effectively manage their intellectual capital, leveraging the data they possess to information that can be acted upon to facilitate knowledge creation. As it was soon established, effective organisational information management is hindered by the lack of structure that pertains information use. The information audit is a management technique that provides the necessary structure by identifying the way in which employees use information in order to perform their tasks. However, even though the technique succeeds in capturing the entities that affect organisational information use, it is accepted that it fails to effectively map the complex many-to-many relationships existing between those entities and to effectively guide the auditors during synthesis between the audit stages. The present paper introduces the generic information business model that overcomes these problems, providing a complete and clear picture of organisational information use. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Objective: To better understand how community advisory boards (CABs) can be used to improve the quality of HIV prevention trials.
   Design: Data collected included descriptive and epidemiologic reports, ethnographic observations, and face-to-face semistructured qualitative interviews with 67 CAB and research team members. Interviews were coded for themes related to community-based consultation.
   Setting: The study was conducted at 6 sites of the HIV Prevention Trials Network-Los Angeles, California; Birmingham, Alabama; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Harare, Zimbabwe; Lima, Peru; and Chiang Mai, Thailand.
   Participants: Thirty-six CAB members and 31 research team members, identified with the assistance of research staff at each site, were recruited for interviews across the 6 sites.
   Results: Both "broad community" and "population-specific" models were identified as strategies for CABs to represent potential participants in HIV prevention trials. CABs viewed their role as a bridge between the research team and trial participants. CABs improved prevention clinical trials by assisting in protocol development, recruitment, and retention. In addition, CABs both identified and helped resolve ethical issues in clinical trials.
   Conclusions: When given time to develop, CABs appear to be a good strategy for building partnerships between researchers and communities for collaborative research projects. This approach has the potential to build sustainable capacity to identify and address ethical issues in research as well as community needs.

AB Despite growing pressures on water suppliers from drought, water shortages, and other challenges, the North American water industry has been Slow to implement reliable and consistent water supply auditing and loss control. AWWA's Technical and Educational Council funded a survey that confirmed that US water loss reporting practices are limited and vary widely. In 2000, an International Water Association task force-with AWWA participation-assembled a water audit methodology as a best management practice (BMP) that is applicable to water suppliers worldwide, providing a framework to tabulate supplier water use and loss. Additionally, effective leakage management methods have been advanced with great success. This article advocates the use of the international water audit method and water and revenue loss control technologies that offer North American water utilities an outstanding water resource recovery opportunity and a great stride toward sustainability.

AB Structural changes in humic acids from a semiarid soil of an experimental farm in Central Spain have been studied by Curie-point pyrolysis. Soil has received periodic inputs of farmyard manure or crop wastes for the last 16 years, and mineral nitrogen fertilisation in 50% of the plots. Analytical pyrolysis suggested substantial differences in terms of the effect of soil management on the accumulation mechanisms of the humic acid fraction. When compared with control plots, humic acids from plots amended with crop wastes displayed well-defined methoxyphenol assemblages, indicating that the diagenetic transformation of lignin could be a dominant mechanism of organic matter stabilisation. The greatest yields of methoxyphenols after organic inputs were obtained in plots receiving nitrogen fertilisation, what agrees with the expected higher performance of the lignin biodegradation in nitrogen-limited media. Increased yields of lignin-derived methoxyphenols were also observed in plots treated with manure, which released in addition a conspicuous series of alkyl compounds suggesting recalcitrant wax-derived lipids incorporated to the humic acids. Highest yields of pyrolytic fatty acids were observed in humic acids from manure-amended plots without nitrogen fertilisation. Alkylbenzene proportions were also pyrolytic descriptors responsive to mineral nitrogen inputs, showing very significant differences (P < 0.01) in both control and amended plots. Results suggested that continued organic inputs can not be considered to increase soil organic matter quality, since microbial reworking of lignins became the dominant mechanism of accumulation of humic acid-type substances, even when nitrogen inputs were applied.

AB 1. Weeds play an important role in arable and horticultural habitats, and models are being developed to improve our understanding of their population dynamics. The position of a weed seed in the soil profile influences the probability of a seed germinating, emerging successfully and its relative time of emergence. Identifying a relationship between the shape or weight of a seed and its ability to emerge from depth may allow the development of generic models. The aim of this study was to quantify seed response to burial depth, to improve the wider application of existing seedling emergence models.
   2. A field experiment used weed seeds sown at different depths and densities in a standard substrate. In addition, two laboratory studies used pre-germinated seeds of the same range of species, buried at a range of depths in optimum conditions using the same substrate. These studies explored the effects of seed size, shape and sowing density on seedling emergence and also enabled reserve-dependent pre-emergence mortality to be quantified.
   3. The largest and heaviest of the seeds tested overall, Veronica hederifolia , emerged from the greatest depth (8 cm). In contrast, Tripleurospermum inodorum and Veronica arvensis , the two smallest species, showed a sharp decline when burial exceeded 1 cm. However, the link between seed shape or weight and the ability to emerge from depth suggests a complex relationship. Given optimum conditions, some species (Stellaria media and Chenopodium album) have the physical reserves to emerge from a wider range of burial depths than normally observed in the field, suggesting an ability to exploit opportunities when they occur.
   4. For some species, emergence was reduced at high seed densities (e.g. Veronica arvensis). These responses may be associated with traits that have evolved to counteract sibling competition.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Generic models identifying the maximum depths for seed germination and emergence have a number of practical applications. For example, they can be used to target cultivation to deplete the weed seed bank or to prescribe the optimum depth of mulches to favour certain species. Our model showed that, in general, larger-seeded species emerged from deeper in the soil, but the relationship between seed size and shape and emergence was complex, possibly species specific. Our germination data may also assist our understanding of the relative importance of different causes of seed losses, particularly from different zones of the soil profile, such as the soil surface. Understanding the component processes of seed behaviour and germination is essential to developing sustainable weed management practices in agriculture and horticulture, and the work reported here contributes to a larger programme modelling weed seed bank population dynamics.

AB In the context of a crisis of confidence in executive leadership in corporate America, this paper examines the role of integrity as a mediator within strategic leadership and its impact on credibility in reputational capital. A tension can occur within strategic leadership between the elements of strategic planning and leadership vision. This tension can destroy the credibility of reputational capital unless strategic leadership is managed effectively. Integrity can be used as the glue providing for credible leadership vision amid a strategic perspective oriented to competitive pressures, thereby enabling strategic leadership to contribute to a sustainable competitive advantage. A strategic leadership audit is presented as a tool by which strategic leadership and reputational capital can be managed.

AB This article traces the origins of HIPC (Heavily Indebted Poor Country) debt sustainability targets. These targets are interpreted as 'switching values', below which countries are expected to avoid debt service problems but, as such, they do not take into account that countries encounter debt problems for a variety of reasons and at different levels of debt. It is likely that the 'true' switching value of the debt-to-export ratio of many HIPCs lie below the present target. Regarding the fiscal window' of the HIPC initiative, the lack of analytical basis for a 250 per cent target for the debt-to-revenue ratio is noted, and the problems raised by the joint 'openness-revenue' condition are discussed. The article concludes that the sustainability targets, as presently applied, are not well supported in analytical terms.

ID SUSTAINABILITY; AGRICULTURE
AB The current industrial pig production model is in crisis, due to its association with environmental pollution, doubtful product quality and lack of animal well-being. In Bretagne (France), a region of intensive pig production, a survey of seven stakeholder groups concerned with pig production was conducted, as part of a research programme dedicated to the assessment of the environmental impact of different modes of pig production. A very large majority of pig. producers (93%) and their suppliers (100%) considers pig farms as an asset for the region, whereas a majority of scientists (58%), activists (78%) and consumers (54%) sees it as a handicap. Differences among stakeholder groups are minor with respect to the perceived importance of environmental and social issues. Stakeholders agree on the relative level of responsibility of pig farms with respect to specific problems. For all groups unpleasant odours and water quality come first with respect to responsibility, for most groups soil quality comes second, followed by product safety and air quality. For a future improved mode of pig production, 76% of pig producers and their suppliers prefer to adapt the current model, for all other groups the majority prefers an alternative model. While pig producers and their suppliers prefer a slurry-based housing system, all other groups prefer a straw-based system. Pig producers see the slurry-based system as technically superior and associate the straw-based system with poor working conditions, whereas consumers associate the slurry-based system in the first place with poor water quality and associate the straw-based system with less pollution. These results will be of use in the research programme on the environmental impact of modes of pig production, as they indicate the environmental impacts to be considered and their relative importance. The results will also help in deciding which options should be assessed. It is concluded that the poor image of the current pig production model and its production practices with consumers does not seem compatible with a sustainable demand for pork products.

A random sample of 205 site locations provided the basis for determining trends in land use. Trends in vegetation clearing were determined using sequential aerial photography for the sample sites, revealing a steady rate averaging nearly 1% of the region per annum over 41 years. This measure of sustained clearing over a large region is higher than recently published clearing rates from South America. Land types have been selectively cleared with over 90% of the Acacia on clay land type having been cleared. A land-holder questionnaire pertaining to the random sites yielded a response rate of 71% and provided information on vegetation clearing, ploughing, tree killing (ring-barking or tree poisoning), and fire frequency, season and intensity. The land-holder responses were compared with independent data sources where possible and revealed no mis-information. However, land-holders may have been marginally less likely to respond if the sample area had been cleared, although this effect was not statistically significant. Ploughing and tree killing are variable depending on land type, but the former has affected about 40% of the Acacia on clay land type, effectively eliminating options for natural regrowth. The proportion of decade-site combinations that were reported as having no fires increased from 22% in the 1950s to an average of 42% for subsequent decades, although the reporting of more than one fire per decade has been relatively constant through the study period. The reporting of at least one fire per decade varies from 46% for the Acacia on sand land type to 77% for the Eucalypt on sand land type for decade-site combinations. Fires are more intense when associated with clearing than in uncleared vegetation, but the proportion of cool and hot fires is relatively constant between land types in uncleared vegetation. Nearly all fires reported were either in spring or summer and this seasonally restricted regime is probably at variance with Aboriginal fire regimes. This study describes the rapid transformation of central Queensland. This has yielded substantially increased agricultural production but may also result in a range of negative impacts and these are discussed. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Swimming respirometry was employed to compare inactive metabolic rate (R-r), maximum metabolic rate (R-max), resultant aerobic scope and maximum sustainable (critical) swimming speed (U-crit), in growth hormone transgenic (GHT) and wild-type (W) tilapia Oreochromis sp. hybrids. Although the R-r of GHT tilapia was significantly (58%) higher than their W conspecifics, there were no significant differences in their net aerobic scope because GHT tilapia exhibited a compensatory increase in R-max that was equal to their net increase in R-r. As a consequence, the two groups had the same U-crit. The GHT and W tilapia also exhibited the same capacity to regulate oxygen uptake during progressive hypoxia, despite the fact that the GHT fish were defending a higher demand for O-2. The results indicate that ectopic expression of GH raises metabolic rate in tilapia, but the fish compensate for this metabolic load and preserve such physiological determinants of fitness as aerobic scope, swimming performance and tolerance of hypoxia.

AB Precipitation is the major water source for agricultural production in the semiarid region of China. Limited and erratic precipitation often results in low crop yields and sometimes in total crop failure. In recent years, rainwater harvesting was promoted to solve water problem for agricultural and domestic uses. Implementation of rainwater harvesting has been successfully solved drinking water problem, and is being adopted to improve crop production and promoted to adjust agricultural structure to increase farm's income and improve living environment. Rainwater harvesting has great potential to achieve sustainable agriculture in semiarid regions.

DE Environmental stress; manage; crop improvement; tropics
AB The only great factor that mankind has not yet managed to control is climate. Global climatic change is a major threat to agricultural production and farmers are facing uncertainty in their practice. Drought, flood, high temperature, salinity and air pollution are among the major factors limiting crop productivity in the tropics. The impact of environmental stress has been successfully evaluated by characterizing morphological, physio-biochemical and yield on various economic crop species within the region. However, the main question not properly addressed as yet is how to manage crops to cope up with environmental stresses prevailing during their growth cycle. We discussed short and long-term approaches currently adopted in research to manage environmental stresses depending on the needs and economic importance of crop species and their cultural practices in this region.

DE Soil quality; indicators; conceptual framework; modeling; WebGIS
AB Soil quality is defined as "The capacity of a specific kind of soil to function within natural or managed ecosystem boundaries, to sustain biological productivity, maintain environmental quality, and promote plant and animal health". It is increasingly proposed as an integrative indicator of environmental quality, food security and economic viability. However, there are a number of constraints to adoption so that indices of soil quality can provide decision tools for policy-makers and help identify the most sustainable management practices for farmers and other land managers. The present research intends to develop a strategy for selecting minimum data set for soil quality indicators in the case area: the Loess Plateau of China, and to develop a conceptual framework for monitoring and modeling the dynamics of soil quality, and finally setup a Web-GIS-based information system to collect the data of soil quality change and predict its in response to potential disturbances.

TI Non-point source pollution of water resources: Problems and perspectives
SO JOURNAL OF FOOD AGRICULTURE & ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE NPS pollution; water quality; integrated management strategy; simulation
   model; sustainable agriculture; GIS
AB Non-point source water pollution also known as diffused source pollution arises from a broad group of human activities for which the pollutants have no obvious point of entry into receiving water courses. Quantification and control of non-point source (NPS) pollution remain relatively difficult tasks as compared to those of "point" sources of pollution. Despite several decades of research on management practices in agriculture to minimize water pollution, agriculture production remains a major diffuse source of water pollutants and water quality degradation throughout the World. The concern for agricultural diffuse pollution sources in integrated water quality management has therefore grown recently throughout the World. Such sources are more critical in developing countries. Surface and groundwater quality degradation due to agricultural practices can be categorized as follows: a) increased erosion and soil loss due to agricultural practices; b) chemical pollution by fertilizer and pesticides and c) pollution from animal operations. Abatement of agricultural diffuse sources of pollution must be conducted in the context of moving towards sustainable agriculture. The paper enumerates the present status of non point source pollution in a global perspective and suggests possible measures to control that.

TI Farmer-managed small-scale irrigation systems for sustainable crop
   production in Uganda, East Africa
SO JOURNAL OF FOOD AGRICULTURE & ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE Small scale irrigation; sustainability of agriculture; crop production
AB The programme was undertaken for a period of two years (March, 1994 to February, 1996) to study the feasibility of installing, designing and laying out the farmers managed small-scale irrigation system for sustainable crop production in Uganda (East Africa) based on participatory approach. The work started having its nucleus activities in Masaka, one of the advanced districts in agriculture. The area used to receive bimodal rainfall giving birth of two crop seasons to a range of annual precipitation of about 1400 mm in a year. Because of sharp decline of annual rainfall (about 500-700 mm/year) from the year 1988 and onwards that leads the planners to emphasize the scientific approach of introducing irrigation water management for crop cultivation in order to get sustainable production. The programme consisted of bench mark survey of 27 randomly selected individual farmers having large, medium and small (>150, 50-150 and <50 hectare, respectively) holding size followed by a diagnostic survey to provide technical instruction and guidelines to the individual in accordance with water resources availability and land situations and model demonstration. A reconnaissance tour programme was also undertaken to rehabilitate the days long practices and earlier efforts along with to bring the resource personnel together in the field of irrigation. The work over the 2-year period recommended that the farmers having abundant water resources could be grouped into three categories; (1) having continuous flow of water connected with perennial sources within the farm area; (2) having lake/river as water source with considerable area under riverbed or river basin; (3) having existing water harvesting structures fully recharged with ground water or flowing surface water and plenty of pounded water with natural springs which could be brought under irrigated agriculture. It was also suggested two other categories of farm lands where either (1) there was possibility of constructing water harvesting structures for recycling the stored rain water for crop cultivation and to take conservational land treatments to preserve more moisture for growing crops under management of rainfed agriculture or (2) to improve the existing dug or tube wells to increase its capacity for livestock and domestic purposes and also to provide life saving irrigation to the standing crops on emergency basis. Small-scale irrigation systems based on farmers' participation for sustainable crop production was successfully designed and laid out befitting the individual farm requirements.

AB Schistosomes and soil-transmitted helminths currently infect a third of the world's human population. An important feature of these parasitic infections is their focal distribution, which has significant implications for control. Only a few studies have been carried out at the microepidemiological scale, comparing infection levels among individuals or households within a single village. In this study, data are presented from a cross-sectional survey, examining all children attending a primary school in rural Cote d'Ivoire over several consecutive days for Schistosoma mansoni, soil-transmitted helminths, and intestinal protozoa. All houses in the main village were mapped, and school children were linked to these households for small-area spatial analyses. Comparison between the 260 school children who live within the main village and the 89 children who reside in nearby settlements revealed significant differences in the overall prevalence and intensity of infections with S. mansoni and hookworm, confirming the focal nature of these 2 parasites. On the other hand, S. mansoni and hookworm infections exhibited random spatial patterns within the main village. The validity of these results is discussed in the context of this epidemiological setting, drawing attention to the issue of scale. Our findings have direct implications for intervention because they call for a uniform, community-wide approach to control schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminthiasis. Implementation can be relatively straightforward, and the proposed control approach might be cost-effective and prove sustainable.

These parameters need to take into account the large temporal and spatial variation in P transfer from individual fields arising from (a) changing but predictable factors such as land use, soil P status, P application rates, forms and ways of fertilization and spreading, (b) predictable but inherent factors such as soil type, soil dispersivity, slope and hydrological routing, and (c) unpredictable weather factors such as rainfall amount and intensity. In most situations, water transport is the driving force of P loss from agricultural land to surface water. Therefore, the hydrological pathways determine to a large extent the relevance of these different factors. Over the last decade several soil P tests have been proposed as a first step to link field conditions to risk of P loss. The major reason is that these soil P tests are also meaningful in discussions with farmers. Recently, more complex P loss risk parameters have been derived based on different approaches. However, the scope and purposes of these P loss risk parameters vary remarkably. Finally, there is a need to evaluate the usefulness of new P tests that can be used as an indicator of P loss risk, e.g. in relation to monitoring purposes. The implementation of the EU Water Framework Directive will increase this need.
   In this paper, the practicable applicability of P parameters for risk assessment is discussed in relation to purpose, scale (from field, farm to catchment), effectiveness, sensibility etc. Furthermore, a conceptual framework for P indicators is presented and evaluated, based on the outcome of the presentations and the discussions in Zurich.

AB Policies for mitigating phosphorus (P) loss from agriculture are being developed in a number of European countries and calculation of P balance at farm-gate or field-scale is likely to be a part of such policies. The aim of the paper was to study P balance at the field-scale in 18 countries that participated in the European Union's (EU) European Co-operation in the Field of Scientific and Technical Research (COST) action on "Quantifying the Agricultural Contribution to Eutrophication (COST 832)". A questionnaire related to P balance at the field-scale was sent to representatives in the 18 countries and all replied. The field as a unit is defined differently in the various European agricultural systems. The identification of the inputs and outputs differ among the countries. For example, P losses may or may not be taken into account in balances. Phosphorus balance at the field-scale is used in all countries in the context of soil analysis and P recommendations for crops and advisory and research purposes, while only a few countries use it for policy purposes (agri-environmental). There is wide variation in P balances between countries in relation to soil fertility and vulnerability of water to eutrophication from nutrients from agricultural sources. In several eastern European countries, Hungary for example, fertilizer P use has dropped to about one tenth of the levels used in the 1980's. Many of these countries now have a negative P balance. In western European countries, by contrast, although fertilizer P use has decreased in recent years, the average input is higher than the average off take, and soil test phosphorus (STP) values remains high and continue to increase in some areas. Twelve different soil extractants for STP are used in Europe, and their interpretation can hinder direct comparisons. Calculating P balance at the field-scale involves approximations in estimating inputs and outputs and spatial variations in fertility in individual fields. Accuracy of data and standardization of methods for calculating balances with inputs and outputs will be a challenge for the future development of a sustainable agriculture in Europe.

AB The present paper summarises observations on the distribution, abundance and population structure of the bivalve Arctica islandica in the North Sea between 1970 and 2000, and demonstrates that Arctica has a widespread distribution in the North Sea north of 53degrees30' N. Along its southern and eastern borders the distribution seems to be limited to depths beyond 30 in. A comparison between distribution patterns of Arctica in 1972-1994 and in 1996-2000 suggests slight changes along its southernmost border in the Oyster Ground.
   In the south-eastern North Sea, the average density of Arctica (>10 mm) was 7 individuals per 100 m(2) and the population was dominated by full-grown specimens exceeding 50 mm shell height. The highest abundance of spat, juveniles and adults was found in the deeper central section of the Oyster Ground that is stratified during summer. There, the mean density was 21 individuals (>10 nun) per 100 m(2). These densities were much lower than in the northern North Sea (Fladen Ground), where abundance was one to two orders of magnitude higher and peaked at 28 600 individuals per 100 m(2). In the Fladen Ground, the population structure was bimodally shaped and dominated by juveniles.
   In the Oyster Ground, the skewed size class distribution suggests that the recruitment to larger size classes is hampered. An insufficiently dense stock of reproducing adults generating less dense spatfalls, possibly in combination with limited survival of spat and juveniles, prevents successful recruitment. Although natural processes may contribute to the skewed population structure, intensive bottom trawling is thought to have a major effect as well. It is therefore questionable whether under present-day conditions the population of Aretica in the SE North Sea can be considered sustainable in the long term. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

The Association supports programs and encourages practices that combat hunger and malnutrition, produce food security, promote self-sufficiency, and are environmentally and economically sustainable. The Association is aware that hunger exists in a world of plenty and that poverty, gender inequity, ethnocentrism, racism, and the Jack of political will are key constraints to solving the problems of global hunger and malnutrition. Recognizing that simplistic approaches are inadequate, the ADA identifies sustainable development as the long-term strategy to ending world hunger and achieving food security. Sustainable development requires political, economic, and social changes that include empowering the disenfranchised, widening access to assets and other resources, narrowing the gap between rich and poor, and adjusting consumption patterns so as to foster good stewardship of nature. Additionally, because the health status of future generations is related to the well-being of their mothers, achieving food security will also require increased access for women to education, adequate health care and sanitation, and economic opportunities. This position paper reviews the complex issues of global food insecurity and discusses long-term solutions for achieving world food security. Achieving the end of world hunger has been and is now within our grasp. There is sufficient food to feed everyone, and solutions can be realized now that will benefit all of humanity. As noted in the paper, most people who examine the costs of ending versus not ending world hunger are bewildered by the question of why humanity did not solve the problem a long time ago. The Association supports programs and encourages practices that combat hunger and malnutrition, produce food security, promote self-sufficiency, respect local cultures, and are environmentally and economically sustainable. The ADA recognizes that decisions and actions that dietetics professionals make as practitioners and consumers can, help reduce the extent of poverty and hunger both here and abroad. This paper provides information, resources, and strategies to assist dietetics professionals in improving the public's understanding of key issues, becoming advocates of the poor, and influencing the political will to end world hunger.

AB Pond structures as cost-effective source-control drainage techniques can be applied in order to reduce the downstream risk of flooding. In the UK, there are no widely accepted performance data on pond structures, yet there is a need for detailed design and operation guidelines, coupled with data on urban biodiversity enhancement, maintenance, reliability, economics and social acceptance. The purpose of this study was to investigate (a) cost-effectiveness and self-sustainability of stormwater pond systems, and (b) compatibility with the primary needs of water removal and storage to wildlife and amenity enhancement A case study was used, based upon a combined attenuation wetland and dry pond construction for roof-water runoff.

AB There is growing awareness that sustainable urban drainage systems can offer a more sustainable option for the management of storm water runoff than conventional drainage systems. This paper presents in-situ performance data from a permeable pavement system which was installed to collect and treat stormwater runoff from a motorway service-station car park. Data on rainfall at the site and outflow from the permeable pavement were collected over a thirteen-month period, and twenty rain events were studied in detail. The system provided a large degree of attenuation in terms of (a) reduction in peak flows, and (b) extended duration of outflows compared with rain events. Infiltration tests provided information on the processes of water entry into the pavement system and impacts of clogging on hydraulic performance.

AB We investigated the mechanism of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) signaling in ovarian theca cells and observed that stimulation with this bioactive lipid markedly enhanced Thr/Tyr phosphorylation of the MAPK ERK1/2. Activation of ERK was transient, showing a peak at 5 min that declined thereafter, and was not associated with a concomitant nuclear translocation of the enzyme, suggesting that a cytosolic tyrosine phosphatase may be responsible for switching off the signal. Epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced activation of the enzyme in the same cell system was more rapid (pea king at 1 min), sustainable for at least 60 min, and could be suppressed by prior treatment with either pertussis toxin or a noncompetitive inhibitor of Ras acceptor protein, manumycin A. This functional inhibition of either Gi or Ras failed, however, to affect the LPA-induced ERK-phosphorylation. Surprisingly, functional inhibition of Rho-GTPase, in C3-exotoxin-lipofected cells, markedly reduced LPA-stimulated phosphorylation of ERK, without affecting the EGF-induced stimulation of MAPK. Theca cells labeled with anti-LPA1/edg2-type antibody showed a distinct cell surface labeling, which is reflected in the expression of (LPA1)-type LPA receptors at both mRNA and protein levels. The findings indicate that LPA transiently stimulates MAPK ERK in LPA1/edg2-expressing theca cells and suggest an alternative mechanism regulating the activation of ERK that differs from the canonical EGF-Ras-MAPK kinase pathway.

TI Building consensus on biological corridors in the Venezuelan Andes
SO MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB The Sierra de Portuguesa is an Andean mountain system with important biodiversity associated with montane vegetation types. Human use existed well before European colonization. Coffee plantations and slash-and-burn agriculture have been predominant in the last 200 years. Three distinct national parks-Yacambu, Terepaima and Gauache-were designated there at different times, according to different criteria. None is large enough to preserve entire montane ecosystems or a viable population of large mammals like the Andean bear. We propose maintenance and restoration of forest interconnections-or corridors-between the parks. Different approaches are considered to implement corridors, on the basis of consensus building among key social and political actors, with top-down and bottom-up approaches that we consider ecologically, socially, and politically sustainable.

   National Park in Sweden
SO MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Fulufjallet, with an area of 385 km(2), was recently designated Sweden's 28th national park. This article describes how the park establishment process turned negative local opinion positive. The basis for success was a shift of focus from restrictions inside the boundaries of the national park to opportunities outside. This "inside out" process implies a new approach to area protection and local community participation in Sweden. This is in line with the contemporary Swedish nature conservation strategy based on the principle of sustainability, which takes account of both ecological and socioeconomic development in a district.

TI Beyond Semantics and the Immediate Postdisaster Period: Community
   Quality of Life as an Overarching Theme for Sustaining Collective Action
SO NATURAL HAZARDS REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
AB The concept of "quality of life" has broad appeal to a variety of professions and disciplines, with increasing centrality to local sustainability. This paper highlights the negative impacts of disasters on quality of life in communities, which are defined as encompassing small neighborhoods to regions. This paper also describes a set of indicators that can be used to assess changes in community quality of life. A matrix of opportunities for enhancing quality of life and promoting tenets of sustainability during the postdisaster recovery period is presented as well as examples of success in communities throughout the United States. The paper concludes that quality of life can serve as the guiding principle for sustainable redevelopment, given its centrality to other ongoing community planning and development initiatives and goals.

SO NATURAL RESOURCES FORUM
LA English
DT Article
DE water as a common property; public water supply; European water
   services; municipalism; water privatization; cost recovery
AB The article contributes to a discussion on two global issues on water: water resources management, and water supply and sanitation. Focusing on Europe, it traces the legal roots of current systems in history: as a resource, water is considered as a common property, rather than a market good; while as a public service it is usually a commodity. Public water supply and sanitation technologies and engineering have developed under three main paradigms: quantitative and civil engineering; qualitative and chemical/sanitary engineering (both on the supply side); and the most recent one, environmental engineering and integrated management (on the demand side).
   The cost of public drinking water is due to rise sharply in view of the two-fold financial challenge of replacing an ageing infrastructure and keeping up with ever-rising environmental and sanitary quality standards. Who will pay? Government subsidies, or water users? The author suggests that apparent successes with privatisation may have relied heavily on hidden government subsidies and/or the healthy state of previously installed water infrastructure: past government subsidies are still felt for as long as the lifetime of the infrastructure.
   The article stresses the importance of public participation and decentralized local management of water and sanitation services. Informing and involving users in water management decisions is seen as an integral part of the 'ethics' side of the crucial three E's (economics, environment, ethics).
   The article strongly argues for municipal provision of water services, and hopes that lessons learnt and solutions found in the European experience may serve water services management efforts in other regions of the world.

AB Tourism is one of the largest and fastest growing industries in the world. It is an increasingly important source of income, employment and wealth in many countries. Its rapid expansion has, however, had detrimental environmental (and sociocultural) impacts in many regions. In this article, I examine the main economic benefits and environmental impacts of tourism, and review the development of the international sustainable tourism agenda. While much of international tourism activity takes place within the developed world, this article will focus on the (economic) development of the industry in developing countries I conclude that new approaches to sustainable tourism development in these countries should not only seek to minimize local environmental impact, but also give greater priority to community participation and poverty alleviation. I argue, in particular, that more emphasis should be given to a pro-poor tourism' approach at both national and international levels.

AB The involvement of local communities as equity holders in major mineral resource developments dates back over a decade in Papua New Guinea. This article reviews the history and result of landowner equity at two of Papua New Guinea's major mines (Porgera and Lihir), with a particular focus on the contribution of these equity holdings to local sustainable development. It is found that while an equity holding can provide significant returns to a local community, it also exposes them to significant financial risk. A second major area of concern is the structures and instruments by which revenues generated from the equity are distributed and utilized within the local community. Further research and policy redirection is required before local equity holding can be viewed as making a significant contribution to local sustainable development.

This involves postponing the final removal of the facility until 100 years into the,future, at which time the residual radioactivity in the structure-and therefore the hazard-is significantly reduced. This places an economic, environmental and social burden on future generations to deal with waste from something from which they have received no direct benefit. Therefore, is Safestore sustainable?

AB We investigated whether the degree of exchange with other populations affects the occurrence of density-dependent regulation. We contrasted data from an Icelandic and a Finnish population of breeding wigeons (Anas penelope), the former population being more closed than the later. We looked for density dependence in time-series data and investigated whether breeding success is density dependent and plays a role in population dynamics and regulation. Time-series analysis did not reveal density-dependent regulation in either population. Nor did we find evidence of density-dependent breeding success in either population. However, population growth rate appeared to be strongly dependent on the breeding success in the previous year in the closed population but not in the open population. Our findings underline how important it is to link time-series analysis to the study of potential stabilizing mechanisms in order to understand population dynamics and regulation. We also suggest that it may be a difficult task to achieve sustainability in waterfowl harvesting, the theoretical basis of which is density-dependent population regulation.

AB Democracy in Georgia has a pathbreaking and exemplary political function for the whole of the Caucasus. Up until now, however, the democratization process in Georgia has been characterized by a discrepancy between the development of formal democratic institutions and unsatisfactory political practice. In addition, democratization is permanently threatened by a multitude of international and domestic problems which overload the problem-solving capacity of the political system. In this respect, democracy in Georgia has not yet reached the stage of self-sustainability.

AB Changes in soil carbon pools under Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata) and bamboo (Phyllostachys pubescens) plantations substituted for a native forest (Quercus acutissima, Cyclobalanopsis glauca, Castanopsis sclerophylla, Platycarya strobilacea, Lithocarpus glaber) were studied on the hills with acid parent rock and soils classified as red soils (Ferrisols) in Huzhou, Zhejiang Province of east China. It was found that total soil organic carbon (TSOC), easily oxidisable carbon (EOC) and water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC) under bamboo plantation were increased, but microbial biomass carbon (MBC) was decreased. On the contrary, Chinese fir induced declines of all fractions of C including TSOC, EOC, WSOC and MBC. The percentages of the active fractions of soil C (EOC and WSOC) were increased in the plantations as compared to the native broad-leaved forest, but proportions of soil organic C as MBC were decreased. It could be concluded that bamboo plantation had a great ability of not only fixing C but also accelerating soil C pool cycle, improving nutrient and microorganism activity; therefore, it is a good ecosystem and could be recommended for wide development. Chinese fir would shrink the soil C pool and deteriorate soil biological fertility, so it did not benefit CO2 fixing and land sustainable utilization.

AB The forest landscape of the United States has changed over time, as has public concern for the trees, water. and wildlife. Early in the history of the United States, forests were viewed as an encumbrance and an inexhaustible resource. used to meet the needs of a growing nation. Around 1900. it became clear that old approaches were not sustainable and forest pathology saw its beginning. Annual lumber production increased front 5.4 billion to 44.5 billion board feet. Forest pathologists were called upon to help manage forests for a variety of products, with a focus on decays of wood and wood products. Projection of timber famine stirred public concern, and a number of laws were enacted to deal with the issue. Pathologists were called upon to deal with many of the issues associated with intensive management, and new pests such as chestnut blight and white pine blister rust demanded attention. Then pathologists were called upon to help manage for multiple benefits, and the issues became more complex. Pests such as mistletoes, root diseases, rusts, nursery pests, and urban pests presented new challenges. Concepts such as landscape level assessments, ecosystem management, and multiple-use led to the management of forests to provide for a complex variety of needs. Management objectives vary across the landscape, and pathologists find themselves working with managers who want to maximize fiber production, those that manage areas set aside for special purposes, and all combinations in between. Issues such as acceptable levels of pests, nonnative invasive species, landowner values, visual and watershed quality, and best management practices must be considered in an ever-changing landscape.

ID TREE DEATH
AB Foundation concepts in forest pathology are based on experiences evolving over time. Three examples will be addressed. (i) The primary concept behind education and research in forest pathology is the widely accepted attitude that disease-causing agents limit full utilization of forest resources. Therefore, we study diseases to find a weak link and then utilize this information to enhance our portion of the shared resource. The sustainable environmental issues of today have changed this concept, in my mind, to one of addressing what is the appropriate "healthy amount of disease" in a sustainable forest ecosystem. (ii) The initial concept that weakened understory trees and poorly managed forests deteriorate and decline over time because of numerous insults from biotic and abiotic agents has evolved into a decline disease stabilizing selection concept whereby healthy dominant trees in the forest (the survivors) are selectively killed by a combination of specifically ordered factors. (iii) The concept that heart-rot decay is initiated by infection through wounds that expose heartwood has evolved into the concept of infection in the sapwood that is compartmentalized over time in the center of the tree.

AB A field experiment to test various management practices of sustainable forestry was conducted in a Swiss spruce forest for two growing seasons. Treatments were a control (C), yearly application of 4000 kg ha(-1) wood ash (A), daily irrigation with a steady state fertilisation as 'optimal nutrition' (F) and irrigation with a water control (W). Samples were taken on a 5 x 5 m grid once a year with a soil corer to determine fine root biomass (less than or equal to 2 mm) and soil pH of the topsoil. A subset of the fine root samples was further analysed for its nutrient composition by CN and ICP-AES analyses. The dynamics of root growth were observed with the aid of ingrowth-cores after 1, 1.5, and 2 years of treatment and the growth pattern was analysed in terms of biomass, tips, forks, length and root diameter of the samples. The A, F and also the W treatment resulted in a significant increase of soil pH in the topsoil. The fine root density increased over the two growing seasons, irrespective of the treatment. The root growth was only slightly different between the treatments with a initially faster growth under the A treatment. The W treatment reduced the number of root tips and forks, and the root length, while the A treatment increased the number of root tips, forks and the root length, but reduced the diameter. The differences between the three harvesting times (March 1999, October 1999, March 2000) of the ingrowth-cores stressed seasonal differences in root growth and the development of quasi 'steady state' root dynamics. The root turnover was not changed by the treatments. The elements in the fine roots were strongly affected by the treatments A and F and sometimes by W. Fine root N increased with the F treatment, while C concentrations decreased under the A, F and W treatments. The Ca and Mg concentrations were strongly enhanced by A but also by the F treatment. The K and P concentrations in the fine roots were improved by all three applications. Due to the pH increase Al, Fe and Mn concentrations in the fine roots were decreased by the A and F treatments. S and Zn concentrations showed inconsistent changes over the growing seasons. The results of this study were comparable with those of other studies in Europe and confirm the abilities of the fine roots as indicators of forest nutrition, to some extent more sensitive than the commonly used foliar analysis.

AB Long-term field experiments conducted under different soil and climate conditions and their databases provide invaluable information and are indispensable means in the study of the productivity and sustainability of the soil management systems. We evaluated the results of the dry matter yields of the main products obtained with four variants of organic and mineral fertilisation in three long-term field experiments established in 1955. The experiments differed in the cultivated crops. The period of evaluation was 12 and 16 years (1985-2000), respectively. The productivity of nine-year crop rotation was lower with the fertilised variants than that with the alternative growing of spring wheat and sugar beets. The dry matter yields on the Nil variants, however, were higher in the crop rotation than in the alternate sugar beet and spring wheat growing, apparently due to the symbiotic nitrogen fixation. The dry matter yields of sugar beet and mainly of spring wheat declined in almost all variants of fertilisation in the alternate sugar beet and spring wheat growing, over the evaluated time period. In spite of the relatively high dry matter production, the declining yields indicated a lower sustainability of the alternate cropping system. Both organic and mineral fertilisation increased the production of the cultivated crops. The differences in the average dry matter yields were statistically significant. Both organic and mineral fertilisation enhanced significantly the N-uptake by the cultivated crops. The effectivity of nitrogen input was the highest with the alternate cropping of sugar beet and spring wheat indicating that it was more demanding for the external N-input and thus less sustainable than nine-year crop rotation.

DE freedom; positive; negative; moral good; T H. Green
AB This article offers a new scheme of the relation between positive and negative freedom that is based on a retrieval of T H. Green's theory of freedom and on further reconstructions of his theory. Some of the distinctions in the literature have proven difficult to sustain, and this has resulted in a weakening of the dichotomy in principle, and of the concepts of positive and negative freedom independently of each other. The main distinction between negative and positive freedom offered here is based on the relation of freedom to the will. We have two kinds of freedom, in both our private and social spheres, because there are two types of goods that we, as human beings, pursue: ordinary and moral. This distinction proves to be sustainable, manages to explain the antagonistic nature of the two concepts, and provides grounds for the support of the two kinds of freedom in their own right.

DE bridges; environment; research & development
AB Historically the management of infrastructure assets has been governed by social, economic and technical constraints. However, in the latter part of the twentieth century, with the advent and growth of the sustainability agenda, it became increasingly apparent that a fourth issue, environment, must also be included in decision-making. Surrey County Council (SCC), as the principal owner of highway assets within its boundaries, is directly responsible for over 1000 road bridges. To meet the authority's own environmental and sustainability objectives, it is clear that there is a need for knowledge on ways in which the organisation can reduce the environmental impact of its activities. The addressing of this need has called for an entirely new approach to assessing structure management activities. With the adoption of life-cycle thinking, a methodology has been developed to enable environmental comparison of alternative structure management strategies. In the context of brick arch highway bridges, the scope of this paper is to present this method and the findings it can produce. The development of the approach is important for SCC objectives, but also provides insight for the wider civil engineering industry, and gives perspectives on how it may tackle the issue of environment.

AB The main environmental impacts caused by fertilizer industry and fertilization were specified and evaluated. The environmental impacts of production and of different types of fertilizers and various fertilization systems were presented. In the past, the global environmental impacts of fertilizer production equaled its use. Thanks to the application of the Best Available Techniques standards and technological modifications of the fertilizer plants, the global impact of industry is only 8-10%. More than 90% of environmental effects is caused but fertilizer losses by decomposition, retrogradation emission of nitrogen compounds nutrients leaching and runoff during fertilization and vegetation. Fertilizer plants caused decrease in total emission of gases and dust as well as in nutrients content in the sewage 5-10 times during the last two decades. The energy used to produce each tonne of fertilizers has been reduced 25-50%. These changes will cause decrease of energy use of world fertilizer industry from recent global world energy consumption from 1.2% to 0.7%. The exploitation of the non-renewable mineral resources, unsolved problem of the waste phosphogypsum and continuation of improving the qualities of its products adopted to new efficient fertilization systems for sustainable agriculture belonging to the future problems of fertilizer industry and modem agriculture.

AB We recently reported that the over-all brightness and bleachability of deinked pulp (DIP) fines were sustainability lower than for the long fibre fraction. It was unknown, however, what caused the poor bleaching response of DIP fines. This work led us to conclude that two factors coming from external contamination were the main cause for the poor bleaching response of DIP fines and low brightness ceiling: high effective residual ink and high level of transition metals, specifically iron.

DE polluted discharges; spoil heaps; oxidative weathering; pyrite; clay cap
ID COMPOST WETLAND; QUAKING HOUSES
AB Polluted discharges from perched groundwater systems in mine spoil heaps are a significant cause of water pollution in many parts of the world. Oxidative weathering and dissolution of sulphide minerals, particularly pyrite, which is widespread within Coal Measures strata, frequently results in surface water discharges rich in iron, sulphate, aluminium and acidity. Reducing the availability of oxygen to mineral surfaces should limit the amount of oxidation taking place and, therefore, reduce the concentrations of contaminants in percolating waters. A pollutant-generating portion of a spoil heap in County Durham, UK, was covered with a clay cap in February 1998, and subsequent monitoring has shown a significant reduction in the concentrations of contaminants in the water discharging from the spoil heap to a nearby constructed wetland treatment system. This allows the wetland to receive better quality water, thereby extending its future life and making it even more sustainable.

DE wind energy; wind energy potential; nature conservation
AB In spite of the well-acknowledged environmental benefits of electricity generation from wind energy, there is increasing concern about impacts from wind turbines on local ecosystems and on the natural scenery. A GIS-based approach is developed to analyse the effect of different nature conservation criteria on the wind energy potential in quantitative terms. Results for two case study regions in Germany, representing a coastal area with-quite good wind conditions and an inland region with limited wind resources, illustrate to which extent the ban of wind turbines in, for example, landscape conservation areas, special bird protection areas, or areas with high visual sensitivity reduces the potential for electricity generation from wind energy. We conclude that even under strict nature conservation constraints there is still a large potential for on-shore wind energy use that can be used to establish a sustainable electricity supply in Germany.

AB Lozada's equation [Resource and Energy Economics 17 (1995) 137] for the change in value of a non-autonomous dynamic program is generalized to stochastic control and applied to the depreciation of a competitive mine facing price, reserve and discount rate uncertainty. Mine depreciation includes the costs of these risks, as well as an adjustment to the 'net price' used to value depletion and revisions. The change in value equation also provides the basis for a stochastic version of Hartwick's Rule [American Economic Review 67 (1977) 972] for sustainable consumption, that the risk adjusted value of net investment equal zero. The analysis has implications for the Weitzman [Quarterly Journal of Economics 90 (1976) 156] welfare measure and the stochasic Hamiltonian. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In Africa, for many people, breeding animals is at the heart of their culture. For the poorest families animals play a vital role in most aspects of daily life, providing food, income and a place in society. Moreover, for poor farmers, livestock are the main source of energy, as they are used for farming and for the transport of their products.
   Unfortunately, trans-border animal diseases remain, to this day, one of the main obstacles to the development of breeding in Africa. They bring about heavy losses, direct and indirect, to national herds and often cause public health problems as well. Regional and international trade in animals and animal products is hampered due to these diseases, which are also one of the main causes of poor performance in the breeding sub-sector and of the growing gap between supply and demand of meat and milk.
   The challenge of maintaining sustainable and competitive growth in animal production requires major improvements in production methods and animal health. Better animal health protection in turn, depends on national policies which confer upon Veterinary Services the responsabilities and organisational structures they once had, but which unfortunately have been withdrawn by structural adjustment policies.

DE common property; community forestry; Mexico; neoliberalism; peasant
   organization
AB This article examines recent agrarian reforms' impact on Mexican community forestry, a common pool resource regime linking peasants' social and economic interests with conservation. It analyzes two agrarian communities that established smaller organizational units and explores peasants' creative responses to neoliberal restructuring, issues posed by new forms of governing collective resources and changing relationships between forestry and community development. Does this restructuring represent reorganization in more effective pursuit of community objectives? Or does it represent division, pursuit of individual agendas inimical to social and ecological sustainability? The counterintuitive experiences of these cases suggest local responses to restructuring may promote viable communities of producers with stakes in sustainable management or bypass such stakeholder communities. In Mexico, common pool resource regimes are best seen not as static categories of private or collective tenure, but as often ambiguous, conflictual property practices embedded in both macro- and micro-level structures.

AB Manipulating soil microbial communities using soil and crop management practices is a basic strategy in developing sustainable agricultural systems. Sustainable farming is based, in part, on the efficient management of soil microorganisms to improve soil quality. However, the identification of biological indicators of soil quality that can be used to predict weed suppression in soils has received little attention. We investigated differences in soil microbial activity among various crop and soil management systems to assess: (i) the microbiological characteristics of these soils; (ii) determine whether any relationships existed that might be used in the development of weed suppression. Soil enzyme activity, water-stable aggregates, and the proportions of weed-suppressive bacteria were compared among seven cropping systems and one native-prairie ecosystem in mid-Missouri, USA. Assays of soil enzymes (fluorescein diacetate hydrolase, dehydrogenase, phosphatase) revealed that organic and integrated cropping systems, and the native-prairie ecosystem had the highest levels of soil activity. Weed rhizospheres from these same ecosystems also had greater proportions of bacterial isolates characterized as "growth suppressive" to green foxtail (Setaria viridis [L.] Beauv.) and field bindweed (Convolvulus arvensis L.): 15 and 10%, respectively. The proportion of water-stable soil aggregates was the greatest in soils with the highest organic matter and was found to be related to higher enzyme and weed-suppressive activity. Selected biological indicators of soil quality were associated with potential weed-suppressive activity in soil when that soil was managed for high organic matter content under reduced tillage systems. This research study provides further evidence that soil quality and sustainable agricultural practices may be linked to integrated weed management systems for the biological suppression of weeds.

AB One of the concerns with strategy as a field is that its goal (durable profits) appears at odds with that of microeconomics (homogeneous firms with zero profits). Thus even if we can find sources of durable profits, maybe we shouldn't-because doing so comes at the expense of social welfare. In this sense, strategy is an 'economic bad.' Probably the most vivid evidence of this tension is the fact that Porter's Competitive Strategy (1982) is Industrial Organization turned on its head-exploiting indications of anti-competitive behavior to create prescriptions for durable profits. This study presents a parallax view in which the field of strategy is an economic good. In this view, heterogeneity stimulates innovation and economic growth. The underlying logic is that heterogeneity fuels diffusion; diffusion erodes leaders' shares; the loss of shares stimulates innovation, which in turn fuels new diffusion. I develop this view through a simple model of firms embedded in an industry, and then evaluate the model via simulation. The key issue for the model is whether there are steady states that sustain heterogeneity and innovation. Results indicate that heterogeneity persists in roughly half the industry conditions I examined. Furthermore innovation and growth are sustained under those conditions. What is comforting about the set of conditions is that they accommodate (and indeed require) all the things we hold dear: industrial policy, and strategic as well as routine behavior by firms. The new insights are as follows: (1) heterogeneity fuels growth (thus 'strategy' is an economic good, rather than anathema to allocative efficiency); (2) persistent heterogeneity is feasible even in the presence of spillovers (without isolating mechanisms); (3) but this heterogeneity (while persistent) requires managers to actively preserve the inherent value of their resource advantages-firms can't rest on their laurels; (4) policy prescriptions differ from those of prior innovation models.

TI Industrial ecology: Shedding more light on its perspective of
   understanding nature as model
SO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Industrial ecology represents an emerging interdisciplinary field of studying industrial systems in combination with their fundamental linkage with nature. An eye-catching characteristic at the basis of industrial ecology's scientific profile is its refreshingly unorthodox perspective of understanding nature as model, compared with other disciplines of understanding nature, e.g. in terms of 'sack of resources' or 'biophysical limit' as opposed to industrial systems. The idea of industrial ecology's appealing perspective is to balance the development of industrial systems with the constraints of natural ecosystems, analogous to an 'industrial symbiosis'. On the basis of initial efforts to conceptualize industrial ecology's underlying assumptions concerning nature, a philosophically focused approach of its characteristic perspective of understanding nature as model is presented. The contribution may provide industrial ecologists as well as other economists, engineers, scientists and policy-makers involved in the field of sustainability with an opportunity for accessible philosophical reflection, perhaps bringing to the surface their tacit frames regarding nature. Consequently, the goal is to gain greater conceptual clarity and to contribute to laying a solid foundation for industrial ecology's stimulating role when initiating change towards sustainability at large.

TI Let the desert bloom: An overview of an attempt to promote sustainable
   development and environmental protection in the Jordanian Badia region
SO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB The Bedu have lived for centuries in harmony with the environment in the Middle Eastern desert known as the Badia region. However, during the 20th century their environment was fragmented and divided to form parts of Jordan, Syria, Iraq and Saudi Arabia. This process restricted their movements and increased the pressure on the environment. In addition, economic growth and urbanization have also had an impact on their way of life. As a consequence, the Jordan Badia Research and Development Programme (BRDP) was established, during 1992, to improve the Bedu's quality of life and to ensure sustainable development and environmental protection in the Badia. This paper reviews the BRDP strategy as well as the deliverables thus far in terms of benefits to local communities, facilities, pioneered projects, main research outcomes and current research priorities.

ID SUPERFUND
AB Recent UK Government strategies and planning policies have embraced the principle of sustainable development, presenting this as a framework for future planning and land-use decisions. This paper will review those policies that emphasize the need to re-use previously developed land. Resulting from these policies is a need for local authorities, in particular, to adopt a sequential testing approach in terms of land-use decisions. We evaluated the sequential testing approaches advocated, examining how they equate with the assessment of indicators of sustainable development. Current sequential testing approaches tend to evaluate over-arching considerations within the planning framework and do not necessarily assess site-specific characteristics.
   This paper argues that if optimum adherence to the principle of sustainable development in land-use decisions is desired, the pre-determination of end-use should be ended or at least minimized since it does not facilitate sustainable development. It is suggested that in order to achieve sustainable development in land-use decisions, a sequential approach to determine end-use, based on those characteristics exhibited by the site is necessary. Therefore, there is also a need for a mechanism that can assess whether the development decision has reached an optimum choice concerning sustainable development.
   The paper concludes by proposing that a framework for expressing site characteristics as elements of sustainable development is needed to enable best possible sustainable land-use decisions. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

AB The capacity of small manufacturing firms to maintain reliable and continuously improving manufacturing processes appears to be a key condition for ensuring long-term sustainability. Governments have been very active in helping them tackle this challenge, in particular by supporting the adoption of world-class manufacturing practices. Despite the many benefits of this support, its application is not always based on exhaustive knowledge of the target firms. Programs aimed at the wholesale promotion of technology. without reference to the competitiveness orientations of the firms concerned, can produce unsatisfactory results. The study described here examines this issue based on a survey of 229 small and medium-sized manufacturing enterprises (SMEs) having received assistance under such a program. Four separate positioning profiles emerge from the study, namely potential practices, emergent practices. priority practices and realized practices. The study also provides a way to associate manufacturing improvement programs and practices with the competitive positioning sought by SMEs. The results of the research should be extremely useful to business assistance programs and to corporate decision-makers. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB It is important to move the attention about online retailing from a technological standpoint to a marketing perspective. The authors develop here a conceptual model based on brand theory, risk theory and information theory to understand the causal relationships among brand knowledge, perceived risk, online search action and the intention to adopt an online retailer The proposed model was tested in an online survey, and structural equation modelling-a powerful analytical tool-was applied to analyse the data. Results show that brand knowledge has a direct and positive effect on intention to adopt an online retailer and this effect can be mediated by perceived risk to a large extent. In addition, perceived risk also positively relates to online search action, which is important in realizing that searching for information increases the risks faced by an online retailer through an expansion of the consumers' opportunity to find more favourable choices. This model is sustainable to additional analysis after control variables, i.e. demographic profile variables, Internet use frequency and risk preference, have been taken into consideration.

AB My initial armchair speculation about what had transpired in urban geography in the 1990s was rudely undermined by a look at the published literature. In the first part of this paper I describe the ways in which the weight of tradition is evident in the urban geography literature of the 1990s; tradition dominates in the topics and themes that are the focus of research, the types of cities studied, the epistemological and methodological approaches used, the gaps that are evident, and the disinclination to make clear the links between research and possible action. In the second part of the paper I describe three strands of path divergence that have emerged in the 1990s from these traditions, namely research on globalization, research on gender, and a greater diversity of methodological approaches and data sources used. In the final section I suggest how we might use tradition as a springboard to move urban geography beyond the 1990s. The topics that demand a larger share of our attention include those focused on the urban environment, sustainability, identity, and megacities in non-OECD countries. I propose that we work to ensure that our research on these and other topics is useful to certain audiences and constituencies by highlighting geographic scale and cross-scale processes and by crossing the permeable boundary that delineates academe.

AB This paper explores some of the more extreme tendencies in the management of public space to consider whether current policy directions, in this case in central Scotland, are driven by a desire to empower or control users of such spaces. The title of the paper is taken from the theoretical lenses provided by Neil Smith and Sharon Zukin in their differential views on trends in the management and control of public spaces. The paper focuses on two local case studies to examine the possibility that a 'revanchist' element is emerging in policies towards public spaces in Britain. The paper concludes that programmes designed to deal with urban and public space are a reaction to both real and perceived problems. However, there has been a privileging of a policy discourse which celebrates the displacement of social problems rather than their resolution. It is argued that such a discourse cannot ultimately provide sustainable policies for the regulation of public spaces and threatens the inclusion of some users of public spaces who may not be considered to be legitimate patrons. While this does more to foster fearful than inclusive public spaces, a thorny question remains over whether some degree of exclusion is a necessary price for policies which seek to secure public space and maintain a wider quality of life.

AB A 5-year program of study was conducted at the Sweetwater Recharge Facilities (SRF) to assess the performance of surface spreading operations for organics attenuation during field-scale soil-aquifer treatment (SAT) of municipal wastewater. Studies were conducted utilizing both mature (similar to 10 yr old) and new infiltration basins. Removals of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were robust, averaging > 90 percent during percolation through the local 37-m vadose zone. The hydrophilic (most polar) fraction of DOC was preferentially removed during SAT; removals were attributed primarily to biodegradation. Reductions in trihalomethane formation potential (THMFP) averaged 91 percent across the vadose zone profile. The reactivity (specific THMFP) of post-SAT organic residuals with chlorine decreased slightly from pre-SAT levels (60 vs. 72 mug THM per mg DOC, respectively). Variations in the duration of wetting/drying periods did not significantly impact organic removal efficiencies. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

DE Brazil; mangroves; occupational structure; poverty; social

AB Various types of subsistence and commercial extraction of mangrove products are identified on the North Brazilian coast. Of 2500 households in 21 rural communities (about 13.000 people) near the Caete estuary, 83% derive subsistence income, and 68% cash income through use of mangrove resources. The mangrove crab (Ucides cordatus) is collected and sold by 42% of households, and constitutes a main income source for 38%. Including processing and trading occupations, over half of the investigated population depend on the mangrove crab for financial income. Mangrove fishery occupies the lower rural income groups in the fisheries sector. About 30% of households engage in commercial fishing in or near the mangrove. Illegal commercial and subsistence use of mangrove wood and bark maintains a considerable number of rural households. In the context of widespread rural poverty in coastal North Brazil, it is important for mangrove management to take into account subsistence production, which has a central socio- economic function for the rural poor who live close to the mangroves. Socio- economic priorities in mangrove villages were, in order of importance, educational quality, occupational options, medical care, the low level of mangrove product prices, access to electricity and local leadership quality.

AB Background: Interventions to improve delivery of preventive medical services have been shown to be effective in North America and the UK. However, there are few studies of the extent to which the impact of such interventions has been sustained, or of the impact of such interventions in disadvantaged populations or remote settings. This paper describes the trends in delivery of preventive medical services following a multifaceted intervention in remote community health centres in the Northern Territory of Australia.
   Methods: The intervention comprised the development and dissemination of best practice guidelines supported by an electronic client register, recall and reminder systems and associated staff training, and audit and feedback. Clinical records in seven community health centres were audited at regular intervals against best practice guidelines over a period of three years, with feedback of audit findings to health centre staff and management.
   Results: Levels of service delivery varied between services and between communities. There was an initial improvement in service levels for most services following the intervention, but improvements were in general not fully sustained over the three year period.
   Conclusions: Improvements in service delivery are consistent with the international experience, although baseline and follow-up levels are in many cases higher than reported for comparable studies in North America and the UK. Sustainability of improvements may be achieved by institutionalisation of relevant work practices and enhanced health centre capacity.

AB Public policy decisions underlie society's response to current animal health issues ranging from emerging diseases and public health threats to food safety concerns and sustainable animal agriculture strategies. Despite strong calls for "science-based" decisions, animal health policy most commonly emerges at the interface of science and politics. Too often scientists' disdain for politics limits their involvement in formulating policy. By contrast, epidemiologists are ideally qualified to bring scientific skills to complex policy issues through analytical, macro-epidemiological approaches that consider the economic, legal, and cultural context of policy issues as well as the biological and medical aspects. Risk analysis provides a systematic approach to evaluating animal health issues and comparing policy options. Capturing these opportunities for applied epidemiology requires an understanding of the policy-making process as well as the basic principles of epidemiology. Furthermore, epidemiology training programs must incorporate communications skill building and experiential learning opportunities in a team environment. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Hydraulic and hydro-salinity behavior of skimming wells under different

   intermittent pumping; hydrosalinity
AB Skimming wells are meant to extract top fresh water layer in the fresh-saline aquifer. Their development in the Indus basin occurred through private sector in a technological vacuum. As a result, these wells have some technical, environmental and social constraints, which hinder the sustainability of these wells. As an initial step to improve the well technology, the hydraulic and hydro-salinity responses of the fresh-saline aquifer under different pumping regimes need to be monitored. The present paper reports the hydraulic and hydro-salinity behavior of the Indus basin aquifer in Pakistan under field conditions at farmers' wells. Two sites, having 6- and 16-strainer wells were monitored during July 2000-December 2001. The 6-strainer well was operated for 4 h with single-, 4- and 6-strainer arrangements and the spatial behaviors of specific drawdown were observed under these arrangements. The 16-strainer well was monitored continuously for the above period. The well discharge, pumped water quality and pumping duration was recorded of every pumping event under farmer's practice to extract groundwater. The rainfall and temporal water table fluctuation was also recorded at this site. The impact of 24 years of well operation on groundwater quality was observed by comparing the hydro-salinity profiles of 1974 and 1998 under 3-strainer well. The results showed that the specific drawdown was higher for single-strainer and it decreased with the increase in number of strainers in skimming wells and hence reduced the chances of saline-upconing. Each strainer in multi-strainer well contributes equally in well discharge provided the horizontal distances among the strainers are equal. The pumped water quality in fresh-saline aquifer was a very sensitive function of fresh water recharge and pumping duration. It was observed that with the increase in daily operation from 2 to 12 h per day, the pumped quality deteriorated three-folds and there was also 30% reduction in well discharge due to high suction lift. It was observed that continuous operation of a 3-strainer well having discharge of 141ps over the 24 years had raised the fresh-saline interface (iso-concentration line of 1.5 dS/m) to 9 m. Keeping in review the observations, it is recommended that the daily operation of 4-6 h keep the water quality within marginal limit (<1.5 dS/m) and the pumping operation is also cost-effective with only 15-20% reduction in well discharge for the study area.

AB Tsetse flies (Diptera: Glossinidae) are important agricultural and medical vectors transmitting the African trypanosomes, the agents of sleeping sickness disease in humans and various diseases in animals (nagana). While the prevalence of disease has increased to epidemic proportions, lack of a mammalian vaccine and affordable and effective drugs have hindered disease control. Trypanosomiasis management relies heavily on the control of its single insect vector, the tsetse fly. Despite the effectiveness of some of these tools, their impact on disease control has not been sustainable due to their local nature and extensive dependence on community participation. Recent advances in molecular technologies and their application to insects have revolutionized the field of vector biology, and there is hope that such new approaches may form the basis for future tsetse interventions. The success of the genetic approaches aiming to disrupt the transmission cycle of the parasite in their invertebrate host depends on full understanding of the interaction between tsetse and trypanosomes. This article reviews the biology of trypanosome development in the fly and the multiple bacterial symbionts that inhabit the same gut environment. The availability of a genetic transformation system for the midgut symbiont allows for gene products to be expressed in vivo in the tsetse gut where they can produce a hostile environment for pathogen transmission. The characterization of gene product(s) with anti-pathogenic properties and their expression in vivo is discussed. A strategy is outlined where the replacement of susceptible insect phenotypes with their engineered refractory counterparts can result in decreased disease transmission. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

AB This paper considers approaches to modeling the dynamics of infectious disease and the application of such models to nematode parasite infections in ruminants. Particularly, these models are developed to account for host genetics and may be used to assess the effects of using genetics to control nematode infections. Three main issues are critically examined: the infection transmission cycle from pasture to host to pasture, the expected genetic relationships between resistance and performance, and the risks of parasite evolution in response to genetic changes in the host. To obtain answers that are realistic and of practical use, the modeling approaches require a solid grounding in biology. This biology is formalized and described using mathematical techniques, with the models parameterized using experimental or field data. Transmission dynamics have been quantified by modeling and are backed by strong experimental data. Selection for resistance will be successful in reducing egg output, pasture larval contamination and hence subsequent larval challenge. Modeling frameworks have been developed to predict genetic relationships between resistance to infectious disease and performance in general, and genetic correlations predicted for nematode resistance are close to mean published values. These predicted correlations strengthen as the larval challenge increases and the dietary (protein) adequacy decreases, however modeling challenges remain. Lastly, although convincing experimental data is not yet available, arguments based on modeling suggest that the risks of parasite evolution in response to genetic changes in the host should be less than the risks arising from other control strategies, such as anthelmintics. Thus, modeling techniques predict that selective breeding for resistance should be an effective and sustainable complementary control measure. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The assessment on key ecological factors affecting runoff and soil erosion and the usefulness of plot-level monitoring of soil erosion was conducted by collecting runoff and soil loss records from 14 runoff plots. The runoff plots were set up in two catchments in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia, where conventional logging and Reduced Impact Logging (RIL) took place. Runoff plots were set up in forest areas with different levels of logging disturbances, i.e. harvesting areas (four plots), skid trails (six plots), and undisturbed/control areas (four plots). The magnitude of runoff and soil loss from skid trail plots were found to be the highest, followed by control plots and harvest plots. Canopy cover, sapling density, litter depth and woody debris appeared to be important ecological factors that determine the magnitude of soil loss. Tree canopy determines the size and erosive power of the raindrops. Sapling, litter layer, and woody debris protected soil surface, thus preventing soil detachment, and provided surface roughness that minimised soil particle movement down the slope. The roles of these ecological factors were less significant compared to rainfall in determining the magnitude of runoff.
   Canopy cover, sapling density, litter depth and woody debris can be measured quantitatively or qualitatively without complicated equipment and methods. Furthermore, they are sensitive to logging disturbance which make them suitable verifiers of soil erosion. Forest managers need to limit disturbance to these factors in order to minimise soil erosion in their logging operation areas. Monitoring of soil loss using runoff plots was cost-effective and provided valuable information about soil erosion risks caused by logging operations. Runoff plots clearly demonstrated site disturbances where the plots are located. Monitoring allowed more direct linkages to be made between management practices and their impacts on runoff and soil erosion, thereby enabling forest managers to identify problems and take appropriate preventive measures to improve their management practices.

AB Streams and drains in blanket-peatland forest in western Ireland were sampled weekly over 5 years, 1996-2000, using continuous, depth-proportional. passive sampling. Analysis was for pH, alkalinity by Gran titration, anions by IC, metals by ICP, aluminium speciation by loaded-resin exchange, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) by absorbance at 320 nm.
   Effects of felling are identified graphically from two forest drains whose catchments (both about 1 ha) were clearfelled, and partial clearfelling of one larger catchment (somewhat over 1 km(2)), in summer 1999. Calcium concentrations and alkalinity were increased in the drain- and streamwater from the felled areas. The pH was increased in drains, while in the larger stream, pH range decreased while the mean increased. Phosphorus increased markedly with clearfell, in the absence of recent fertilising, and also increased with fertilising; these results are reported in an accompanying paper. Ammonium-nitrogen concentrations were increased in the two drains with felling, and temporarily decreased in the larger stream. Nitrate increased in some cases. Potassium and manganese concentrations also increased. Concentrations of DOC and organic monomeric aluminium increased gradually, subject to a continuing strong annual cycle. There were no clearfelling effects on concentrations of solphate, suspended solids or inorganic monomeric aluminium. In the two drains (fully clearfelled), concentrations of sodium, chloride and magnesium, and conductivity, were all reduced after felling. Fertilising effects other than for phosphorus were indistinct.
   Effects of the combined clearfell-reforestation treatment were testable statistically, using randomised intervention analysis, between two larger streams (1 km(2)) as a treatment-control comparison. There were statistically significant positive responses in streamwater concentrations of nitrate, potassium, calcium, DOC and aluminium fractions. The implications for management practice depend on whether the loss of nutrients is sustainable for future crop productivity, and whether critical limits and loads of receiving ecosystems are exceeded.

TI A model of glutting: human capital and labour markets in the long-run
SO APPLIED ECONOMICS LETTERS
LA English
DT Article
AB For over a century and a half, there have been cyclical phases of saturation and shortage in the numbers of students enrolled at German and Prussian universities. Starting from this observations, this article constructs a neoclassical glutting theory. A twofold hypothesis is put forward. First, the behaviour of students in their choice of curriculum depends on the expected rewards. Indeed, the allocation of students to the various faculties depends on the comparative yields of the latter in terms of expected earnings and job availability in the corresponding professional sectors. Thus, the rewards expected by a student are represented by the earnings on the labour market at a given moment and that he or she considers to be sustainable in time. Second, an attraction phenomenon may appear for certain curricula when a shortage occurs in different professional sectors. Once the shortage has been made up, the demand effect continues as a result of delay in the perception of the situation by young people. This may gradually lead to comparative over-production of qualified university leavers. This unbalanced situation diverts new cohorts of students to other sectors of education and may cause a new shortage, finally resulting in a cyclical movement modulated according to job availability.

AB Understanding and predicting how bird populations and land cover respond to natural and anthropogenic changes is a major challenge for environmental planning. Multi-agent modelling enables horizontal relationships (spatial configurations) and vertical relationships (socio-economic organisation) to be integrated. GEMACE is a multi-agent model for simulating farming-hunting-duck interactions in the Camargue (Southern France). For an archetypal region, we simulated land-use conversion and ecological change in space and time resulting from the interaction between environment and human. drivers. A wintering duck population is simulated and distributed heterogeneously in its habitats. The duck population is affected by various environmental factors such as land-use changes, wetland management, hunting harvest, and disturbance. Land-use decisions are made at farmland level by farmers and hunting managers. Important biophysical drivers are water and salt-through land relief, land-use history, infrastructure, spatial. neighbourhood, and current land use. Important human drivers are the economic conditions of the world agricultural market and land-use strategy. Through three scenario runs, we discuss the implications that can be drawn from this modelling application with regard to the viability of a spatial conservation management alternative and multi-field research on sustainable development.

AB How do long-term global trends affect a transition to sustainability? We emphasize the "multitrend" nature of 10 classes of trends, which makes them complex, contradictory, and often poorly understood. Each class includes trends that make a sustainability transition more feasible as well as trends that make it more difficult. Taken in their entirety, they serve as a checklist for the consideration of global trends that impact place-based sustainability studies.

ID POPULATION
AB Sustainable development exhibits broad political appeal but has proven difficult to define in precise terms. Recent scholarship has focused on the nature of a sustainability transition, described by the National Research Council as meeting the needs of a stabilizing future world population while reducing hunger and poverty and maintaining the planet's life-support systems. We identify a small set of goals, quantitative targets, and associated indicators that further characterize a sustainability transition by drawing on the consensus embodied in internationally negotiated agreements and plans of action. To illustrate opportunities for accelerating progress, we then examine current scholarship on the processes that influence attainment of four such goals: reducing hunger, promoting literacy, stabilizing greenhouse-gas concentrations, and maintaining fresh-water availability. We find that such analysis can often reveal "levers of change," forces that both control the rate of positive change and are subject to policy intervention.

AB Global environmental change and sustainability science increasingly recognize the need to address the consequences of changes taking place in the structure and function of the biosphere. These changes raise questions such as: Who and what are vulnerable to the multiple environmental changes underway, and where? Research demonstrates that vulnerability is registered not by exposure to hazards (perturbations and stresses) alone but also resides in the sensitivity and resilience of the system experiencing such hazards. This recognition requires revisions and enlargements in the basic design of vulnerability assessments, including the capacity to treat coupled human-environment systems and those linkages within and without the systems that affect their vulnerability. A vulnerability framework for the assessment of coupled human-environment systems is presented.

AB The vulnerability framework of the Research and Assessment Systems for Sustainability Program explicitly recognizes the coupled human-environment system and accounts for interactions in the coupling affecting the system's responses to hazards and its vulnerability. This paper illustrates the usefulness of the vulnerability framework through three case studies: the tropical southern Yucatan, the and Yaqui Valley of northwest Mexico, and the pan-Arctic. Together, these examples illustrate the role of external forces in reshaping the systems in question and their vulnerability to environmental hazards, as well as the different capacities of stakeholders, based on their access to social and biophysical capital, to respond to the changes and hazards. The framework proves useful in directing attention to the interacting parts of the coupled system and helps identify gaps in information and understanding relevant to reducing vulnerability in the systems as a whole.

AB The challenge of meeting human development needs while protecting the earth's life support systems confronts scientists, technologists, policy makers, and communities from local to global levels. Many believe that science and technology (S&T) must play a more central role in sustainable development, yet little systematic scholarship exists on how to create institutions that effectively harness S&T for sustainability. This study suggests that efforts to mobilize S&T for sustainability are more likely to be effective when they manage boundaries between knowledge and action in ways that simultaneously enhance the salience, credibility, and legitimacy of the information they produce. Effective systems apply a variety of institutional mechanisms that facilitate communication, translation and mediation across boundaries.

AB A multicommutation-based method has been developed for the on-line direct atomic fluorescence spectrometric (AFS) determination of Hg in waters without any previous sample treatment. The performance of the proposed procedure has been compared with that of a conventional AFS system based on continuous mode measurements. In short, the use of multicommutation, together with a reduction of the size of the liquid-gas phase separator, provides an increase of the laboratory productivity by improving the sample throughput by a factor of 3.6 and strongly reduces the sample consumed by a factor of 6 and reagent consumed by a factor of 8.4. The waste generation is reduced by a factor of 2.4 and the Ar consumed by a factor of 6, thus the developed method is an environmentally and economically sustainable alternative to the methodology based on continuous measurements, without any reduction of the analytical sensitivity and with an enhancement of the repeatability of measurements. Only the limit of detection was poorer for the methodology developed (1.3 ng l(-1)) than that found by the classical continuous mode (0.3 ng l(-1)). The aforementioned methodologies were applied to the determination of Hg in water samples having obtained comparable values by both procedures and with those found by an external laboratory.

AB Nodipecten (Lyropecten) subnodosus (Sowerby 1835), the largest pectinid in tropical waters, has been continuously exploited. In support of sustainable development for this species, we started basic growth studies to establish aquacultural practices. N. subnodosus was cultured using triangular plastic cages in La Paz Bay (1995-1996) to describe growth and survival; we determined relationships between quantity of available food and growth and behaviour of body component indices. This culture system allows an isometric shell growth of scallops over 13 months; 56.8 +/- 2.1 mm height, 54.5 +/- 2.1 mm length and 23.0 +/- 1.1 mm width. Allometric growth was found between weight and height. length and width (survival was 44.3%). Body component indices and growth increased progressively until the summer of 1996 when all indices decreased negatively, influenced by high water temperatures. Gonad tissue developed during the first year. Gametogenic activity was evident, presenting the first spawn in summer. Particulate organic and inorganic matter and chlorophyll concentrations were relatively constant during the study, and there was no evidence relating these values to growth and body component indices. Culture of N. subnodosus is feasible in La Paz Bay. However, high water temperatures in summer reduced growth and survival rates.

AB Reduced-impact logging (RIL) and conventional techniques (CNV) were compared in a mixed dipterocarp hill forest in East Kalimantan in three blocks of about 100 ha each. Damage was evaluated using pre- and post-harvesting assessments in 24 one-hectare sample plots. RIL techniques nearly halved the number of trees destroyed (36 vs 60 trees/ha). RIL's main benefit was in the reduction of skidding damage (9.5% of the original tree population in RIL vs 25% in CNV). Before logging, mean canopy openness in CNV (three plots only) and RIL (9 plots) was similar (3.6 and 3.1%) and not significantly different (x(2) = 2.73, P = 0.254). After logging, the mean canopy openness was 19.2% in CNV (n = 9 plots) and 13.3% in RIL (n = 8 plots), and the distributions of the canopy class in RIL and CNV significantly different x(2) = 43.56, P < 0.001). CNV plots showed a higher proportion of measurements in the most open class greater than or equal to30% than in RIL. At a larger scale, the area of skidtrail per unit timber volume extracted was halved in the RIL compartment (15 m(2) vs 27 m(2) m(-3) for CNV). However, under high felling intensity (>8 trees/ha), both stand damage and canopy disturbance in RIL approached those recorded in CNV under low or moderate felling regime. Over this felling intensity threshold the effectiveness of RIL in reducing tree damage is limited. In mixed dipterocarp forest where harvestable timber density generally exceeds 10 trees/ha, a minimum diameter felling limit is clearly insufficient to keep extraction rates below 8 trees/ha. Based on these new results and previous studies in Borneo, we suggest three silvicultural rules: (1) to keep a minimum distance between stumps of ca. 40 m, (2) to ensure only single tree gaps using directional felling, (3) to harvest only stems with 60-100 cm dbh. Foresters, policy makers and certifiers should consider these as criteria for sustainable forest management. We emphasise the need to expand harvesting studies to look at impacts and trade-offs across larger forest landscapes, to expand RIL beyond silvicultural concepts and to include the maintenance of other forest goods and services.

AB In this paper, we examine a trend in forestry which may be dubbed 'back to nature' and ask if it offers a sustainable future for forestry. We analyze what is actually meant by 'back to nature', which type of nature we want to 'get back' to, and how ensuing silvicultural philosophies can be defined. 'Back to nature' can be understood in a temporal sense referring to a certain composition or structure of a forest at a given time. But it can also refer to the processes taking place in an actual forest. Thirdly-in a broader sense-'back to nature' may represent the wish to revert to a more 'simple' way of silviculture and forestry in general, doing away with habitual thinking and the creation of dogmatic approaches. Currently, there is no consensus on an interpretation of 'back to nature'. Moreover, quantitative data from long-term empirical field trials are still limited. Sound science is needed to underpin the claims of the advocates of various interpretations of back to nature silviculture. It might be difficult to pinpoint what a sustainable future for forestry entails, but it is clear that a sustainable future for forestry to a greater extent than previously will require balancing commodity and environmental and nature values both against one another and against any concerns felt to be relevant by the various stakeholders.

AB Rationale and Objectives. The authors sought to create a simple, versatile, and effective store-and-forward telemedicine system to facilitate consultation between medical students pursuing elective study at remote locations in the developing world and specialists at the central institution.
   Materials and Methods. A trial telemedicine system was established between Gizo Hospital (Gizo, Solomon Islands) and Emory University Hospital (Atlanta, Ga). At Gizo Hospital, the system consisted of a commercially available digital camera and a locally available personal computer with a modem providing low-bandwidth (dial-up) Internet access. A visiting British medical student at Gizo Hospital used this equipment to relay digital photographs of patients, as well as the results of relevant tests, such as electrocardiograms, radiographs, and ultrasound images, to Emory University Hospital via the Internet for review by a specialist.
   Results. The medical student, who had received minimal training (approximately 1 hour) in the use of this telemedicine system, used it successfully to perform eight referrals during the elective course period. Following the student's return home, his local preceptors at Gizo Hospital and a physician at Helena Goldie Hospital on New Georgia Island used the same system for more than 60 additional referrals.
   Conclusion. The telemedicine system is a low-cost, robust, and sustainable means of providing expert support to medical students and other health care providers in remote locations.

AB Community-focused nurses routinely confront issues of environmental hazards in the context of the community. Limits to disciplinary knowledge about health, environment, and community constrain practice for many who are interested in ways to promote community health across a spectrum of diverse needs and contexts, including the context of the environment. The purpose of the reported critical ethnography was to explore the relationships among health, environment, and culture from the cultural context of one community. Findings highlight the emancipatory, yet ambiguous, process through which this community transformed individual symptoms of illness into an experience and examination of community environment and community health. The significance of this work lies in inductively building knowledge and theory about these relationships and community empowerment for community-focused nursing.

AB Interest in organic farming is growing rapidly in Europe. The resulting expansion of the organic farming area has been expected to enhance the biodiversity of agricultural habitats. Organic cropping practices can be hypothesized to support a higher number of weed species than conventional cropping and also to favor herbicide-susceptible and less-nitrophilous species. The diversity and species composition of weed communities were compared in spring cereal fields cultivated by organic, conventional cereal and conventional dairy cropping methods in southern Finland between 1997 and 1999. Samples were taken before (May-June) and after (July-August) the treatment of conventional fields with herbicides. The number of species was used as a measure of species diversity. The total and mean numbers of species between cropping practices were compared by applying rarefaction and ANCOVA, respectively. In organically cultivated, fields the adjusted mean number of species per field exceeded that in conventionally cultivated fields by about two species in both May-June and July-August. The total number of species was higher in organically cultivated fields only in July-August. The species composition of organically cultivated fields was closer to that of conventional dairy than to that of conventional cereal fields. Species susceptible to herbicides (e.g. Chenopodium album) were abundant in organically cultivated fields in both sampling periods whereas the relative abundance of some of them declined in conventional fields from May-June to July-August. In conventional fields, the relative abundances of Viola arvensis, Stellaria media and Elymus repens increased from May-June to July-August. Only weak support was found for the hypothesis that organic cropping favors less-nitrophilous weed species. It is concluded that organic cropping promotes weed species diversity at an early phase of cropping history but that a change in species composition would require a longer period of organic cropping.

AB Both anticipated climate change and dryland salinity pose a strategic threat to the sustainability of about 6 Mha of agricultural land in Western Australia (WA). These phenomena require an integrated analysis to estimate their potential impacts and initiate strategic thinking about adaptation. Water loss below the root zone, i.e. deep drainage, is the primary cause of sub-soil salt mobilisation leading to surface soil salinity in areas cleared of natural vegetation in Australia; hence deep drainage is an important externality of agricultural production. The purpose of this paper is to show how changes in CO2 concentration, temperature and precipitation may affect agricultural production and deep drainage.
   Results are presented of a simulation experiment with the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM)-Nwheat model in which we explored sensitivity of (1) wheat production and quality, and (2) deep drainage, for three sites in WA differing in average precipitation, two soils, various nitrogenous fertiliser rates and present wheat cultivars. Since results of Global Circulation Models (GCM) are still largely inconsistent for this region, we have opted for a factorial approach in adapting 90 years of historical weather data. This set-up enabled separation of effects Of CO2, temperature, precipitation and their interactions, and unravelling of the complex interactions between water and nitrogen availability, phenological development and climate change factors, in the extremely variable Mediterranean climate in WA.
   Elevated CO2 concentration increased yields, particularly if nitrogen fertilisation was sufficient and conditions were relatively dry. Higher temperatures had non-linear effects, with initial (up to 3 degreesC) benefits on clay soils, but not on sandy soils, and then substantial yield declines. Both elevated CO2 concentrations and temperatures (+3 degreesC) decreased grain protein, but in financial terms this was more than offset by the increase in yield in most cases. If, in addition, precipitation was decreased, financial returns dropped below present levels, particularly in the low precipitation regions. Deep drainage tended to be slightly higher under elevated CO2 concentrations but when higher temperatures were also simulated this was reversed. Deep drainage was greatly reduced in the low precipitation scenarios. Evidently climate change is not only likely to affect productivity, but also deep drainage and hence dryland salinity. The impact can vary in direction such that both 'win-win' and 'lose-win' outcomes may occur, particularly depending on the relative change in precipitation. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Sustainable cropping systems are essential for agronomic, economic, and environmental reasons. Data from a winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)/summer fallow rotation experiment, in eastern Oregon, was used to evaluate long-term effects of tillage, N, soil depth, and precipitation on yield. The soil is a Walla Walla silt loam (coarsesilty, mixed, mesic Typic Haploxeroll). The experiment consisted of three tillage treatments (moldboard plow, offset disk, and subsurface sweep) and six N treatments. Four main time periods (1944-1951, 1952-1961, 1962-1987, 1988-1997), were identified, within which experimental treatments were consistently maintained. Depth to bedrock ranged from 1.2 to 3.0 m. Yield was significantly greater (>300 kg ha(-1)) for the moldboard plow than for the subsurface sweep in all time periods. Yield was generally greater (>100 kg ha(-1)) for the moldboard plow than for the offset disk, but only significantly in Time Periods 3 and 4. For Periods 1 and 2, the addition of N fertilizer tended to produce higher yields, regardless of quantity or distribution of rainfall. For Period 3, yield did not increase with the addition of more than 45 kg N ha(-1), which we attribute to below-normal precipitation. For Period 4, when precipitation was above average, yield increased with the addition of up to 90 kg N ha(-1). Results demonstrated that despite beneficial effects on soil properties, conservation tillage has tended to be less productive for this cropping system than moldboard plowing, probably due to lack of downy brome weed control in the conservation tillage systems.

AB This article raises issues about work intensity, pace, and sustainability during physical activity, focusing attention on the nature of work in labor-intensive societies, the management of exertion in habitual tasks, and the health and broad socioeconomic correlates of alternative ways to regulate work patterns. At the heart of this review are concerns to document human adaptability (in terms of the physical and behavioral management of heavy work) and to renew debate regarding the conceptualization and measurement of work intensity (variously evaluated in absolute or relative terms, as indexed by oxygen consumption, energy expenditure, percentage maximal work capacity, heart rate elevation, time and motion indicators, or physiological cost). Three questions are examined: Is heavy work primarily a matter of time or energy intensity? How is heavy work habitually sustained? What is the bigger picture relating work performance to work context and to nutritional or health status? It is argued that many arduous activities, such as carrying loads, demand endurance over time rather than intensive effort per unit time, and that work pace management lies in regulating both the rate of work and the time in rest during physical activity. Furthermore, strategies that maximize long-term endurance (adopted by "tortoises") and those that maximize short-term productivity (adopted by "hares") are appropriate to different work contexts (e.g., a subsistence or wage-labor economy) and suit individuals with different health status and ability. Thus, work intensity is an important aspect of the links between physical activity, health, productivity, and society, as noted in literature reviewing objectives for sustainable development and public health messages for disease risk management. These areas of scholarship are underresearched, partly because consensus has been slow in agreeing on which are the best measures of work pace and work intensity for use in field situations, and which are the most meaningful thresholds for evaluating absolute or relative effort across a range of populations.

AB This paper shows how bottom-up activity analyses within a dynamic computable general equilibrium framework can be undertaken for the longer-term analysis of energy and climate policies using the model SCREEN [25]. In particular we demonstrate for the case of Switzerland how the impact of policy measures to reduce the carbon intensity of the energy sector can be assessed with such a model for various socio-economic and environmental dimensions (e. g., CO2 emissions, GDP, employment, foreign exchange rate). The results can provide valuable insights for the appropriate design of energy or climate policies that allow for the targeted fostering of a more sustainable energy development.

AB The Polish energy industry is facing challenges regarding energetic safety, competitiveness, improvement of domestic companies and environmental protection. Ecological guidelines concern the elimination of detrimental solutions, and effective energy management, which will form the basis for sustainable development. The Polish power industry is required to systematically increase the share of energy taken from renewable sources in the total energy sold to customers. Besides the economic issues, particular importance is assigned to environmental factors associated with the choice of energy source. That, is where life-cycle assessment (LCA) is important. The main purpose of LCA is to identify the environmental impacts of goods and services during the whole life cycle of the product or service. Therefore LCA can be applied to assess the impact on the environment of electricity generation and will allow producers to make better decisions pertaining to environmental protection. The renewable energy sources analysed in this paper include the energy from photovoltaics, wind turbines and hydroelectric power. The goal and scope of the analysis,comprise the assessment of environmental impacts of production of 1 GJ of energy from the sources mentioned above. The study will cover the construction,, operation and waste disposal at each power plant. Analysis will cover the impact categories, where the environmental influence is the most significant, i.e. resource depletion, global warmth potential, acidification and eutrophication. The LCA results will be shown on the basis of European and Australian research. This analysis will be extended with a comparison between environmental impacts of energy from renewable and conventional sources. This report will conclude with an analysis of possibilities of application of the existing research results and LCA rules in the Polish energy industry with a focus on Poland's future accession to the European Union. Definitions of LCA fundamental concepts, its methodology and application are described in the ISO 14040-14049 series of standards. These standards have already been introduced in some countries, but in Poland they are still at the stage of translation into Polish. Nevertheless some companies in Poland try to assess how their products influence-the environment and what are the possibilities of technology improvement in the existing production process reduce their environmental impact.

AB Nematode community analysis may provide a useful tool to quantify soil health. Nematode communities were monitored for 5 years during a 12-year period in the sustainable agriculture fanning systems (SAFS) project at UC Davis, where conventional (CONV), low-input (LOW) and organic (ORG) management treatments were compared. After the completion of three 4-year crop rotation cycles, a uniform crop of oats was grown in 2001. The composition of the nematode genera was different from year to year, but there were significant management effects on genus composition in each year, with the CONV treatment being significantly different from the LOW and ORG treatments. Important contributors to the differences in genus composition among treatments were plant parasitic nematodes. Nematode community indices (enrichment (EI), basal (131) and channel (CI) indices) of the CONV treatment differed from those of the ORG and LOW treatments in 1993, 1994, 1995 and 2000, but not in 2001. The difference in structure index (SI) among management treatments was significant in 1995 and 2000. El and SI were generally lower, and 131 and Cl higher in CONV than in LOW and ORG treatments. There were significant crop effects on the community indices throughout the years. Even in 200 1, there was a residual effect of the crop grown in 2000 on most nematode community indices. Differences in El, BI and C-I among crops were consistent, while those in SI were not. Meloidogyne javanica (Treub) Chitwood, juveniles added to various soil samples were reduced by 68% in soil where nematode trapping fungi had been added and which had low BI (12) and low CI (20) values. Soil from SAFS plots with a high BI (47) and high CI (70) after I year of oats and ploughing, suppressed root knot juveniles much less. There were significant negative correlations between BI and root knot nematode (RKN) suppression (-0.72) and between CI and RKN suppression (-0.74). Thus, BI and Cl appeared to be most valuable as indicators for long-term effects of management on nematode suppression. However, BI and SI may be more suitable as general indicators for the health status of a soil, since Cl can be high in highly disturbed agro-ecosystems as well as in undisturbed natural ecosystems. A high BI would indicate poor ecosystem health, while a high SI would indicate a well-regulated, healthy ecosystem. For agricultural soils the presence of large populations of plant parasitic nematodes forms an additional indication of poor ecosystem health, as natural regulation is limited in this case.

AB Volcanic ash-derived soils in Chile show very unique behavior and properties as soil system due to their unusual composition characterized by high allophane and stabilized humus content. These soils constitute excellent models to study both natural and man-induced VA mycorrhizal effect over plant nutrition and soil ecology sustainability. This paper studies the effect of Glomus etunicatum inoculation of wheat in a natural volcanic soil fertilized with soluble P or with partially acidulated-rock phosphate (pa-RP) at two rates (17 and 86 kg P ha(-1)); yield, plant phosphorus acquisition, and mycorrhizal colonized root length, are measured. The influence of these treatments on mycorrhizal mycelium and spore production as well as on soil phosphatase (P-ase) activity was also determined. The inoculation of G. etunicatum, locally isolated, increased significantly the extent of P plant acquisition, spore number, length of extraradical mycelium, and P-ase activity when compared with indigenous arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi fertilized with pa-RP, at the level of 86 kg ha(-1). In concordance with these results, the remaining available P in the experimental soil without inoculation was depressed. A negative impact of soluble P application in G. etunicatum inoculated soil was noted in the P-ase activity, and also in the effectiveness of the applied inoculum in relation to P plant uptake. In soil AM inoculated and fertilized with pa-RP (86 kg ha(-1)), the enhancement of P-ase activity was related to high mycelium development and spore formation. P plant acquisition in G. etunicatunt inoculated plants ranged from 4.96 to 11.57 mg per pot when 86 kg ha(-1) of pa-RP is applied compared with the same amount of soluble P Surprisingly, adding pa-RP does not improve the amount of colonized root length. Fungal root AM colonization and AM propagules (mycelium and spores) were not depressed at higher soluble P supply, but the activity of G. etunicatum measured as P plant uptake was strongly affected. The inoculation with G. etunicatum enhances spore production, particularly at the lower soluble P and at the highest pa-RP levels. A close relationship (r = 0.938) between AM spores and P-ase activity was found. Only in pa-RP treatments the G. etunicatum inoculation reduced the external P wheat requirements. The improvement of P-ase activity by G. etunicatum inoculation, as a biological factor involved in P-cycling in soil, may be an important mechanism related to plant P acquisition. It is concluded that pa-RP is the best source of P, not only by increasing P uptake by interacting with G. etunicatum, but also by enhancing AM propagules (mycelium and spores) remaining in soil.

AB 1. While conservationists, resource managers, scientists and coastal planners have recognized the broad applicability of marine protected areas (MPAs), they are often implemented without a firm understanding of the conservation science - both ecological and socio-economic - underlying marine protection. The rush to implement MPAs has set the stage for paradoxical differences of opinions in the marine conservation community.
   2. The enthusiastic prescription of simplistic solutions to marine conservation problems risks polarization of interests and ultimately threatens bona fide progress in marine conservation. The blanket assignment and advocacy of empirically unsubstantiated rules of thumb in marine protection creates potentially dangerous targets for conservation science.
   3. Clarity of definition, systematic testing of assumptions, and adaptive application of diverse MPA management approaches are needed so that the appropriate mix of various management tools can be utilized, depending upon specific goals and conditions. Scientists have a professional and ethical duty to map out those paths that are most likely to lead to improved resource management and understanding of the natural world, including the human element, whether or not they are convenient, politically correct or publicly magnetic.
   4. The use of MPAs as a vehicle for promoting long-term conservation and sustainable use of marine biodiversity is in need of focus, and both philosophical and applied tune ups. A new paradigm arising out of integrated, multi-disciplinary science, management and education/outreach efforts must be adopted to help promote flexible, diverse and effective MPA management strategies. Given scientific uncertainties, MPAs should be designed so one can learn from their application and adjust their management strategies as needed, in the true spirit of adaptive management.
   5. It is critical for the conservation community to examine why honest differences of opinion regarding MPAs have emerged, and recognize that inflexible attitudes and positions are potentially dangerous. We therefore discuss several questions - heretofore taken as implicit assumptions: (a) what are MPAs, (b) what purpose do MPAs serve, (c) are no-take MPAs the only legitimate MPAs, (d) should a single closed area target be set for all MPAs, and (e) how should policymakers and conservation communities deal with scientific uncertainty?

AB The fisheries of Lake Victoria in East Africa must be managed effectively to ensure sustainable food supplies. This has been impossible in the past due to inadequate knowledge of commercially important fish stocks. Here we present the first acoustic abundance estimates of fish in Lake Victoria. Five lakewide acoustic surveys were conducted between 1999 and 2001, using the Simrad EY500 echo-integrator with a 120 kHz split-beam transducer. There are many species of fish in Lake Victoria, however, only limited identification of targets can be achieved by present methods. Broad categories were distinguished by visual examination of echo-traces. The echo-integrals were partitioned between four target groups: (1) the Nile perch (Lates niloticus), a top predator, (2) small pelagics comprising mainly the dagaa Rastrineobola argentea together with mixed species of haplochromines, (3) the crustacean Caridina nilotica and (4) other species. Spatial and temporal differences in the Standing Crop were observed between north and south, and between shallow and deep water. Most fish were found inshore but the spatial distribution varied between seasons. Mid-lake fish densities were higher in August compared to February. In August, the water column is well mixed while in February it is stratified with a low-oxygen layer inhospitable to fish near the bottom. There are consequent changes in the characteristics of observed echo-traces. Over the survey series, Nile perch biomass showed a consistent decline, while the stocks of small pelagic species increased. We emphasize the need for simple rules to identify species, and hydrographic monitoring to assist echo-trace classification. In the absence of any other source of comprehensive biomass estimates, the value of acoustic surveying in Lake Victoria is demonstrated.

AB Seagrass beds play an important role in coastal ecosystems as primary producers and providers of habitat and environmental structure. Therefore, mapping seagrass beds is indispensable in the management and conservation of sound littoral ecosystems, and in the development of sustainable fisheries in coastal waters. Multi-beam sonar is often used to map bottom topography. We developed a mapping method to quantify the volume of seagrass using a multi-beam sonar. Seagrass beds were scanned with the multi-beam sonar and quadrat sampled to verify the distribution of seagrasses. We used software to discriminate seagrass signals from echoes to obtain a topographic profile of the bottom without seagrass this was then subtracted from the topography including the seagrass. We then mapped seagrass distribution, calculated seagrass volume, and estimated biomass using volume and quadrat samples. We applied these methods to map a seagrass bed of Zostera caulescens in Otsuchi Bay, on the Sanriku Coast of Japan, during the growing season of 2001. A transducer was attached to a boat (one gross ton) equipped with a differential-GPS, a motion sensor, and a gyrocompass. The vessel completed a grid survey scanning whole seagrass bed with an area of 115 m x 156 m at bottom depths between 2 and 8 in within about 40 min when traveling at a speed of 1.5 m s(-1) (3 knots). The multi-beam sonar was able to visualize three-dimensional seagrass distribution without interpolation and easily to estimate area and volume occupied by the seagrass using hydrography software. The results indicated that Z. caulescens was distributed at bottom depths of 6-7 m with a surface area of 3 628 m(2) and a volume of 1 368 m(3). The mean biomass of above- and below-ground parts of seagrass were estimated to be 28.6 gDW m(-2) (range 26.6-30.9) and 15.9 gDW m(-2) (range 14.1-17.7). Our study demonstrated that multi-beam sonar is effective for mapping and quantifying the spatial distribution of seagrass beds, and for visualizing the landscape of the seagrass canopy.

AB The feeding behaviour of small tuna on the mesopelagic fish Vinciguerria nimbaria Was Studied in an equatorial area of the Atlantic Ocean (10-20degrees W. 0-5degrees N). Acoustic data (from a scientific Cruise) and tuna stomach content data (from the tuna purse-seine fishery) were combined. V nimbaria formed loose schools that occurred in clusters during daytime, and large aggregations during, the night. The characteristics of the schools and clusters were analysed. The average length, size and packing density of the day-school were estimated at 48.5 in, 24 400 individuals, and 5.8 fish m(-3). respectively. The average,,c length Of Clusters was close to 10 km. The packing, density of night-school was estimated at 1.6 fish m(-3). The preying of tuna on V nimbaria was modelled as a stochastic process based on two Poisson processes. Daily rations Of tuna were estimated at 3.5% and 7% of the body weight. Taking into account the swimming performance of the prey and the predator, we showed that tuna were able to feed oil day-schools in a very short time. whereas feeding during the night by filtering was not competitive. Furthermore, a cluster is able to feed a single tuna school during 2 months, proving the sustainability of the biomass of small tuna in the area by V nimbaria.

DT Article
AB The German Federal Supreme Court (BGH) on June 11, 2003 ruled on cases in which operators of wind power plants had demanded that an electricity utility buy their wind power generated electricity.
   In line with earlier decisions, the BGH ruled that the legal requirement to buy this electricity was constitutional under the Renewable Energies Act (EEG) and the Electricity Feeding Act.
   This ruling further cements the principle of private patties subsidizing third patties under the EEG.
   The legal minimum prices for wind power generated electricity under the EEG are considerably above the market price of conventional electricity and, thus, have caused a boom in the construction of more wind power plants. The volume of payments for feeding into the public grid electricity from wind power plants reached the amount of euro 1.530 billion in 2002, which is an average extra cost of, at present, euro cent 0.46 per kWh. Given a 20-year period of subsidizing individual plants, double-digit billions are expected to arise as financial burdens over the next few decades.
   The German federal government introduced a proposal of an EEG hardship clause. This is unlikely to relieve industries of EEG burdens on a broad basis.
   Besides present economic burdens, also the sustainability of this kind of energy policy is doubtful, both from economic and social points of view.

AB Molting females of Monteiro's Hornbills (Tockus monteiri) seal themselves in nest cavities to breed until chicks are about half grown. To gain insight into the chronology of energy requirements of the Monteiro's Hornbill family unit in relation to this peculiar breeding strategy, we measured a number of ecological, physiological, and environmental variables during the Monteiro's Hornbill's breeding season. Those measurements included rates of energy expenditure of female Monteiro's Hornbills while in the nest cavity, characterizing their thermal environment, timing of egg laying, molt, hatching and fledging of chicks, as well as measuring clutch size and chick growth. Temperatures within the nest box varied between 12 and 39 degreesC and did not affect the female energy expenditure. Female body mass and energy expenditure averaged 319 g and 5 W, respectively, at the start of concealment and decreased by on average 1.1 g day(-1) and 0.05 W day(-1) during at least the first 30 days of the 52-58 day concealment period. Clutch size varied between 1 and 8 and averaged 4.1 eggs, with eggs averaging only 66% of the mass predicted for a bird of this size. Over the range of chick ages at which the female might leave the nest, the predicted energy requirements for maintenance and tissue growth for a Monteiro's Hornbill chick increase sharply from 1.2 W at age 8 to 3.0 W at age 25. Reduction of the female energy requirement with time, the relatively low growth rate and therewith low energy requirements of Monteiro's Hornbill chicks, and an appropriate timing of the female's exodus from the nest cavity all aid in containing peak energy demands to levels that are sustainable for the food provisioning male.

   Australia: a Missing Research Agenda?
SO AUSTRALIAN GEOGRAPHICAL STUDIES

DT Article
DE sustainable consumption; lifestyles; human geography; urban
AB 'Consumption' is a central concept in the global environmental sustainability agenda. However, one important argument from Agenda 21 - that all social actors must now practise 'sustainable consumption' - has been publicly and politically marginalised in high-income countries such as Australia. Geographers potentially have a role in bringing consumption back onto the agenda by constructing a critical geography of consumption. Such research can help understand how the contextual use of natural resources is perceived and practised, and how consumption helps to shape contemporary social relations. This body of knowledge is vital for building sustainable development into everyday lives. Yet a focus on urban consumption perceptions and practices appears somewhat lacking in Australian geography. Ways forward can be drawn from international geography, such as in the United Kingdom where a substantial body of work has drawn a complex picture of contemporary consumption and environmental understanding. It has also challenged prevailing 'ecological modernisation' policy approaches, which ignore consumption's cultural facets. In sum, considering consumption in Australia can offer insights into cultural practices expressed through consumption; can challenge and add to European geographical literatures, and can also contribute to sustainability debates by offering alternatives to currently ineffective policy discourses.

AB Field trials to control the small fox tapeworm Echinococcus multilocularis failed to reduce the prevalence of the parasite persistently. With the experience from this empirical work, a simulation model for the population dynamics of the small fox tapeworm was developed. This model is used to examine the effect of different control strategies. Sufficient control duration is able to eradicate the parasite in simulation experiments. Baiting intervals of 4 or 6 weeks were found to be more efficient than shorter or longer intervals. The strategy used in field trials showed no sustainable effect in any of the simulation experiments. The applicability of simulation models for the planning of control measures for wildlife diseases is discussed.

AB In 1992 parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) agreed to develop and implement policies to regulate and facilitate access to genetic resources (AGR). We examine regulations and agreements in Brazil, Colombia, and the Philippines in detail and discuss how these countries are implementing the AGR mandate. In particular, we evaluate progress toward achieving the CBD objectives of conserving biological diversity, using its components in a sustainable manner, and equitably sharing the benefits arising from the use of genetic resources. We highlight the difficulties in developing and implementing these policies, arising from the conflicting goals of regulating and facilitating AGR, as well as the special character of genetic resources, existing ex situ collections, issues of ownership and tenure, and the dearth of legal, institutional, and scientific capacity in many countries. We recommend (1) independent, multidisciplinary evaluation of the success of the access policy in achieving CBD objectives, (2) resolution of the conflict between traditional land tenure and legal property rights of genetic resources so as to match conservation obligations with benefit-sharing rights, (3) recognition that benefits obtained from AGR may be entirely non-monetary, and (4) that countries provide a 'two-track' AGR application process separately for commercial and non-commercial users.

AB A recent trend in biodiversity conservation has been to undertake conservation planning exercises at regional scale, which attempt to protect a representative sample of all habitat types in an entire ecological region. The Cape Action Plan for the Environment (CAPE), which focussed on the Cape Floristic Region (CFR), is one of the more advanced of current initiatives. This 2-year project, funded by the Global Environment Facility, was designed to develop a strategy and action plan for the CFR. What was special about CAPE was the combination of stakeholder involvement with an explicit, quantitative planning procedure. This paper gives an account of the process by which this was achieved, and describes the project activities, the public involvement process and a brief overview of project findings. CAPE was a multidisciplinary conservation planning process at relatively large scale, with a key focus on building partnerships between executing agencies, non-governmental organizations, research institutes and the private sector from the outset. This was done to create commitment to implementation and ensure long-term "social" sustainability to match the efforts towards ecological sustainability. The paper concludes by offering some guidelines on the management of ecoregional conservation planning. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB The rich biodiversity of the Cape Floristic Region makes a substantial contribution to the regional (particularly the Western Cape) and national economy. Harvesting of marine resources, such as linefish, rock lobster, abalone and bait species, is worth over R 1300 million year 1, or R1.12 million km(-l) year(-1). Harvests of fynbos products such as wildflowers and thatching reed, and forest products, timber and ferns, are worth R27 and R26 ha(-1) year(-1) on average, respectively, and a total of R78 million year(-1). Natural resource-based tourism is one of the greatest income generators in the region, which is renowned for its beauty and floral diversity as well as other nature pursuits such as whale watching and angling. The natural resources of the CFR also contribute indirectly to the region's economic output: fynbos bees contribute to commercial fruit production, and fynbos mountain catchments provide the region's main water supply. Less tangible values include the option, or future use, value of the region's rich biodiversity, and existence value, for which estimates have been made on the basis of contingent valuation studies. The total economic value of the CFR is estimated to be at least R10,000 million per year (US$l = R7 in 2000), equivalent to over 10% of the regional Gross Geographic Product. However, invasion of aliens, transformation of natural vegetation and overexploitation of resources threaten the sustainability of this value. Invasive alien plants, which are the greatest proximate threat to floral diversity, already intercept significant water supplies. However, clearing is costly, and while government has an incentive to clear publicly owned mountain catchment areas, private land-owners do not. Similarly, private benefits of conserving fynbos areas do not provide sufficient incentive to protect against transformation to more lucrative farming activities, including monoculture of indigenous species. Current values of marine resources are unlikely to be upheld due to the overexploited status of most stocks, a problem which is compounded by poorly defined property rights, open access and inadequate law enforcement. It will be necessary to provide incentives to private landowners and resource users if optimal levels of protection are to be achieved to maximise benefits to society.

AB This paper describes the history of conservation in the Cape Floristic Region, and the development of a conservation action plan for the region, arising from the Cape Action Plan for the Environment (CAPE). The plan turns the long-term strategy, which identified priorities for conservation action, into a practical 5-year action plan. The tension between protection and the use of natural resources is addressed within the context of institutional frameworks. CAPE has succeeded in bringing together previously fragmented institutions, and has ensured that they work together more effectively. It has also strategically realigned existing resources earmarked for conservation. The factors that contributed to this success include a long history of research-based management; the existence of a body of understanding and knowledge that made it possible to rapidly assess conservation priorities; a small but viable number of scientists to carry out the planning phase of the project and institutions willing to take it forward.

AB High-quality research in the field of marine biotechnology is one of the key-factors for successful innovation in exploiting the vast diversity of marine life. However, fascinating scientific research with promising results and claims on promising potential applications (e.g. for pharmaceuticals, nutritional supplements, (feed-)products for aquaculture and bioremediation solutions) is not the only factor to realise the commercial applications of marine biotechnology. What else is needed to exploit the promising potential of marine biotechnology and to create new industrial possibilities? In the study project 'Ocean Farming-Sustainable exploitation of marine organisms', we explore the possibilities of marine organisms to fulfill needs, such as safe and healthy food, industrial (raw) materials and renewable energy in a sustainable way. One of the three design groups is envisioning the future of strong land-based 'marine' market chains. Marine biotechnology is one of the foci of attention in this design group. This article provides a model of future-oriented thinking in which a variety of experts actively participate. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We confirmed that an NAD(P)+-dependent secondary alcohol dehydrogenase (NAD-(P)-E) can be easily and effectively isolated from pea, soybean, and wheat proteins immobilized with calcium alginate gel (IPP, ISP, and IWP, respectively). The estimated molecular mass of NAD(P)-E is 138.7 kDa, and the concentrations of NAD(P)-E in solution are 36.2 (IPP), 53.9 (ISP), and 93.7 (IWP) mug/mL. The NAD(P)-E oxidizes only (R)-isomers highly enantioselectively; thus, greater than 99% ee(s) of (S)-isomers can be obtained from corresponding rac-aryl methyl carbinols (1, 2a-6a, and 2b-7b). The amount of food protein needed for 1 g of substrate (B/S ratio) is approximately 20. Thus, in comparison to current biocatalysts, certain food proteins can serve as asymmetric reagent bases, providing easily obtained, low-cost natural catalysts with stereoselectivity, regioselectivity, and substrate specificity that work under mild conditions for asymmetric synthesis of organic compounds. Moreover, this "fourth" function of food may help build a sustainable society by synthesizing optically active secondary alcohols in an environmentally friendly manner.

AB The notion of identity is commonly utilised by individuals as a shorthand, both to describe themselves and other individuals or groups of people. While I show that descriptive uses of identity are valuable for explanatory purposes, they are of limited use in elucidating the tranformational relation between social and structural change and individual personhood through which young people come to understand themselves and the world around them. Focusing upon a single case study, I show that identity is not simply a product or outcome of change, but is itself an input into the processes that produce change. The 2-year period between the ages of 15 and 17 was a critical period for Lesley, during which she challenged and questioned previously accepted ways of knowing and doing. Lesley did not ignore her experiences or her understanding of them. She utilised her new self-understandings and the meanings that she associated with them to construct and produce a sustainable and coherent self-narrative for her future use.

AB Environmental improvement in the building sector will be crucial for the societies ecological sustainability development. Life-cycle assessment (LCA) is one of the well-known tools used ad hoc for ecological sustainable development. In the implementation of a generic LCA methodology applicable on constructions, the most complex abstraction level for the functional output will focus on the building operation usefulness, which regards services rather than construction properties. Furthermore, constructions or parts of it can be regarded as a streamlined application of an LCA methodology operating on the more complex service building level. A number of significant characteristics valid for a generic LCA methodology for buildings have been put forward and then checked in accordance with "today's practice", represented by five different LCA concepts utilised for buildings. On this basis, current practice but also development needs have been identified on the following themes; service coverage, life-cycle definition, time dependence (coverage), life-cycle inventory and life-cycle impact assessment.

SO BULLETIN OF MARINE SCIENCE

ID ZONATION; SLOPES
AB This paper presents the use of two complementary remote sensing techniques in the Banco Chinchorro: satellite image and echosound. A cartographic relation was established between the shallower reef depths recorded by Landsat-MSS and those of greater depth recorded with echosound. A bathymetric map of the shallow lagoon areas and reeferest was generated from the Landsat-MSS image using exponential correspondence between reef depths and corrected digital values in the image. The reef lagoon exhibits a bathymetric gradient from I in in the north to 25 in in the south. The echosound data show a pinnacle with depths greater than 300 m. Largely due to intense coral growth, the most pronounced slopes are found near the leeward reeferest, and the more gradual on the windward margin. The use of these two complementary remote sensing techniques proved an efficient tool for characterizing reef morphology when depth strongly affects the efficacy of one or the other technique. The analytical delimitation of this complex reef is increasingly important because of its recent designation as a biosphere reserve area by the Mexican government. The present study is a pioneering effort that could be used as a pilot in future administrative, conservation, and sustainable management studies.

AB Changes in the queen conch population structure from 1990-1997 were analyzed. Density and length-frequency data were collected in four fishing sites within Banco Chinchorro, using four random sample units of 100 m(2). All conchs contained in the sample unit were measured for shell length and returned to the bottom. Von Bertalanffy's growth parameters, natural mortality, and total mortality were calculated. There was a significant decrease in conch density over the years. The highest density (2.651 conchs m(-2)) occurred in 1992 at Cayo Norte and lowest occurred in 1994 (0.108 conchs m(-2)) and 1997 (0.006 conchs m(-2)) at Isla Che. There were significant differences in mean shell length (SL) between years. In 1994 mean SL was 229.30 +/- 2.07 mm; in 1997 mean SL was only 128.30 +/- 3.23 mm and 99.31% of conchs were lesser than 200 mm SL. No significant differences in the L-infinity were detected from 1990-1997, but K had higher values in 1997 (K = 0.45) indicating presence of a juvenile population, with a higher natural mortality (M = 1.06). Conch stock at Banco Chinchorro is overexploited and if the levels of harvesting continue the fishery is predicted to collapse in a short period. A total ban of five years is proposed and more conservative management measures are recommended in order to maintain a sustainable conch fishery.

AB Climate variability, coupled with increasing demand is raising concerns about the sustainability of water resources in the western United States. Tree-ring reconstructions of stream flow that extend the observational record by several centuries provide critical information on the short-term variability and multi-decadal trends in water resources. In this study, precipitation sensitive Douglas-fir ( Pseudotsuga menzeisii) tree ring records are used to reconstruct annual flow of the Yellowstone River back to A. D. 1706. Linkages between precipitation in the Greater Yellowstone Region and climate variability in the Pacific basin were incorporated into our model by including indices Pacific Ocean interannual and decadal-scale climatic variability, namely the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and the Southern Oscillation. The reconstruction indicates that 20th century streamflow is not representative of flow during the previous two centuries. With the exception of the 1930s, streamflow during the 20th century exceeded average flows during the previous 200 years. The drought of the 1930s resulted in the lowest flows during the last three centuries, however, this probably does not represent a worst-case scenario for the Yellowstone as other climate reconstructions indicate more extreme droughts prior to the 18th century.

AB Rabies is a neglected disease in many developing countries. It is preventable, and the tools to prevent it are known. There is urgent need for more funding, for study of innovative dog population-control measures, and for sustainable canine immunization. Safe and effective tissue-culture rabies vaccines and human and equine rabies immunoglobulins (HRIG and ERIG) are not readily available in many regions where rabies is endemic. This and the continuing presence and spread of rabies have increased the risk for travelers, who cannot rely on being able to receive optimal postexposure treatment in many parts of the world. Alternatives to HRIG or ERIG are not available. Travelers who leave the safe environments of tourist hotels and buses in regions of Asia, Russia, Africa, and Latin America where canine rabies is endemic may be at risk of life-threatening exposure to rabies.

AB To develop a research agenda for use of antiretroviral therapy ( ART) in countries with highly limited resources for health, research questions focused on 3 areas: when therapy should be initiated, what therapies should be used, and the most appropriate methods for patient monitoring. Participants from 23 countries and 6 continents were clinical and academic researchers, health care practitioners, policy authorities, pharmaceutical experts, and health care advocates. The conference attendees reviewed background materials and participated in 13 state-of-the-art presentations on ART provision in resource-limited countries, treatment access, ethics, community issues, and sustainability. Conferees separated into smaller groups to identify priorities for specific research agendas. Existing multinational human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) clinical trials networks, such as the HIVNAT ( The Netherlands, Australia, and Thailand) Network, were studied as infrastructure models for research into affordable, sustainable treatment and monitoring strategies suitable for resource-limited settings. The delivery of ART in resource-limited countries is a vital priority for health care providers and the millions of people living with HIV disease. To achieve sustainable approaches to HIV/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome care, research relevant to resource-limited settings must involve local researchers and community representatives to promote development of local capacity.

AB The world's domestic animal breeds represent an important resource for economic development and livelihood security. Extensive genetic diversity in these breeds allows the existence of livestock in all but the most extreme environments globally, providing a range of products and functions. Unfortunately, a large number of breeds have been lost and many more are at risk of loss. An important research and development goal is the systematic evaluation of breeds in production systems where they arc typically found, quantitative assessment of the genetic diversity they possess, the definition of relationships amongst breeds and the implementation of programmes for their effective management, including development of policies and strategies for conservation and sustainable utilisation. The key issues of threats to livestock genetic resources, justification for conservation, conservation strategies, priority-setting for conservation are summarised. The potential contribution of economic valuation in ensuring equitable sharing of benefits derived from domestic animal genetic resources (AnGR) is also discussed. Decisions will be required about which breeds are of highest priority, and which conservation or management options represent optimal use of resources for diversity conservation. There is urgent need for the development and application of economic and policy analysis tools to aid rational decision-making in the management of the global domestic AnGR. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

AB Many of the world's poor depend directly upon genetic, species and ecosystem biodiversity for their livelihoods. In many regions animal genetic resources (AnGR) are a vital component of this biodiversity. An estimated 1.96 billion people rely on livestock to supply part, or their entire daily needs. Complex, diverse and risk-prone peasant livelihood systems need AnGR that are capable of performing the functions required of them in these systems-AnGR that are flexible, resistant and diverse. In order to assess the importance of AnGR, as distinct from livestock per se, for sustaining and improving the livelihoods of the poor, the factors that differentiate between species and breeds in terms of the functions that animals fulfil in livelihoods and household economies need to be better understood. Central to this is the need to understand the functions of livestock as household assets, the full set of purposes the poor have in investing resources in livestock keeping, and the genetic traits that are important for the fulfilment of these purposes. If AnGR conservation is to make a contribution to improving the livelihoods of poor livestock keepers, the relative importance of AnGR from the livestock keepers' perspective should be appraised. Then ways of maintaining and enhancing AnGR best suited to improving the livelihoods of the poor and ensuring equitable access to these resources can be addressed. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB The proximate causes and processes involved in loss of breeds are outlined. The path-dependent effect and Swanson's dominance-effect are discussed in relation to lock-in of breed selection. These effects help to explain genetic erosion. It is shown that the extension of markets and economic globalisation have contributed significantly to the loss of breeds. The decoupling of animal husbandry from surrounding natural environmental conditions is further eroding the stock of genetic resources. Recent trends in animal husbandry raise serious sustainability issues, apart from animal welfare concerns. The extension of markets and economic globalisation have contributed significantly to the rapid loss of domestic breeds, especially livestock. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Microbial characteristics of soil are being evaluated increasingly as sensitive indicators of soil health because of the clear relationship between microbial diversity, soil and plant quality and ecosystem sustainability. This study aimed to determine microbial carbon biomass and microbial abundance after fire to estimate the degree of damage, including the rate of recovery of micro-organisms, in each area. The study also aimed to establish relationships between microbial biomass and microbial abundance and the physico-chemical properties of the soil. The study was conducted in three different study areas in Hiroshima prefecture, one unburned area and two burnt areas (one immediately after and one 2 years after fire). anova showed a significant difference in microbial carbon biomass and microbial abundance among the study areas. Microbial carbon biomass and microbial abundance were highest in the unburned area, followed by the area burnt 2 years ago and lastly by the area studied immediately after fire. Carbon biomass was highly correlated with microbial abundance (r(2) = 0.950). Carbon biomass and microbial abundance were shown to be significantly correlated to the soil's physico-chemical properties, such as pH, moisture content, water-holding capacity and carbon : nitrogen (C : N) ratio. However, the C : N ratio was closely correlated to both carbon biomass and microbial abundance with r(2) = 0.705 (P < 0.01) and r(2) = 0.560 (P < 0.01), respectively.

AB The paper describes the central ideas of a new approach to creating Web- sites of art museums; it is proposed to take into account the peculiarities of the child's cognitive- emotional sphere for constructing children- oriented Web- sites of art museums. The idea is that usual Web- sites are created to inform the users, to display the treasures, to show the gems of the collections in order to attract the attention of the audience. The way information is provided is based on the expected background of the possible users and on possible motivation.
   In case of children, everything is different: information acquisition is to be based on strong interest. It means that the child should be struck by the vision, then be emotionally touched and have enough time for establishing links between the images already existing in his/ her conceptual picture of the world and new, just found images. In respond, the child will positively or negatively react to the acquired piece of information and inscribe his/ her interpretation of the new found vision into his/ her conceptual system, including his/ her estimation of the vision. The significance of such Web- sites for creating cognitive foundations of sustainable development and the role of natural language interfaces are discussed.

DE energy efficiency; barriers; partnering
ID ENERGY-EFFICIENCY; PRIVATE FINANCE; ECONOMICS; MARKET
AB This paper explores the barriers to energy efficiency in the construction of non-domestic buildings in the UK. The source of the barriers is argued to lie in the organisation of the construction industry. including the linear design process. the reliance on cost-based competitive tendering and the incentives placed upon different actors. The consequences include oversizing of equipment. reduced quality, neglect of whole life costs and lack of integrated design. Each of these problems can usefully be interpreted using concepts from the new, institutional economics. While the barriers are well known to construction industry specialists, they are relatively neglected in the academic literature on energy policy. Furthermore. conventional policy measures such as building regulations leave these barriers largely untouched. The UK construction industry is currently undergoing a series of reforms which aim to change the relationship between different actors and to achieve improvements in product quality and productivity. While these reforms have the potential to address many of the barriers. the reform agenda snakes practically no reference to sustainability. This paper argues that climate policy objectives, must be integrated into the reform agenda if the UK is to begin the transition to a low carbon built environment. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

TI How labour organization may affect technology adoption: an analytical
   framework analysing the case of integrated pest management
SO ENVIRONMENT AND DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS
LA English
DT Article
AB Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is an important component of sustainable agriculture. Farmers who switch from a more capital-intensive pesticide-based pest management strategy to IPM have to substitute capital with labour. The adoption of IPM will therefore depend, among other things, on the opportunity costs of labour. A simple model analyses the trade-off between IPM and current farmers' best practice in developing countries. Modifications of the model include different forms of labour organization in pest management, such as owner operated and short- and long-term labour contracts. The implications are that agricultural policies, environmental policies, and labour market policies can go hand in hand. Unfortunately, this will be more likely at a higher level of original pesticide use and hence a higher level of environmental costs.

SO ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING B-PLANNING & DESIGN

ID VISUALIZATION; LANDSCAPE
AB A prototype decision support tool is described which provides options for the management of existing green spaces and for the establishment of new green space in suburban neighbourhoods. Suggested neighbourhood greening techniques include the naturalization of existing parks and increased foliage along streets and rights of way. The naturalization approach involves less frequent cutting in grassy fields, the introduction of native species, and the cessation of pesticide and herbicide applications. Increased plantings along streets and boulevards would improve the aesthetics of neighbourhoods, and may provide some relief from climatic extremes and urban heat island effects. The creation of new green space in already-built suburban neighbourhoods provides a longer term challenge to neighbourhood planners. Potential strategies include the introduction of small pocket parks and community gardens in vacant lots and school yards. Modelled outcomes from such neighbourhood greening strategies could be used in public meetings both to incorporate attitudes of the impacted community and to demonstrate benefits to a wider community. In particular, strategies should take into account issues of safety and perceived safety that commonly arise with the greater use of naturalization in green space management. The developed prototype decision support tool has been coded as an ArcView GIS extension and provides the opportunity to model and evaluate future scenarios better aligned to principles of sustainable community development. Three applications of this tool are discussed to illustrate some of the benefits of undertaking a range of neighbourhood greening strategies.

AB Corporate financial statements do not include environmental values. This deficiency has contributed to the criticism that company managers do not include environmental impacts in the internal decision-making process. The accounting profession has not developed effective environmental reporting guidelines. This situation contributes to a second problem: the apparent inability of corporate reports to provide useful information to external parties. It has been suggested that by using nonmarket valuation methodologies, financial statements can be used to measure progress toward sustainable development. Nonmarket valuations are not generally accepted by the accounting profession. They are too subjective to support effective decisions, and too costly to obtain. Furthermore, demand for this sort of information appears small. Some of these issues may be resolved over time. The most serious challenge, however, concerns how enhanced financial reports would be used. Financial statements are supposed to help investors assess the amount, timing, and uncertainty of future cash flows. A substantial portion of environmental value is based on nonuse benefits, much of which will never be realized in company cash flows, In other words, the role of financial statements would have to change. Furthermore, since there is no general agreement as to the meaning of "sustainable development," efforts to operationalize the term have been fraught with difficulty. Moreover, monetization of environmental values could jeopardize their preservation, leaving some to question the overall objective of this form of reporting. For these reasons, while it is to be hoped that better reporting of environmental impacts will be forthcoming, the greatest advances will likely be outside the financial statements themselves.

AB This paper reviews relevant literature on the sustainability indicators theoretically proposed and practically applied by scholars over the past 15 years. Although progress is being made in the development and critical analysis of sustainability indicators, in many cases existing or proposed indicators are not the most sensitive or useful measures in developing countries. Indicator selection needs to meet the following criteria: relative availability of data representing the indicators, sensitivity to stresses on the system, existence of threshold values and guidelines, predictivity, integratability and known response to disturbances, anthropogenic stresses, and changes over time. Based on these criteria, this paper proposes a set of operational indicators for measuring agricultural sustainability in developing countries. These indicators include ecological indicators involving amounts of fertilizers and pesticides used, irrigation water used, soil nutrient content, depth to the groundwater table, water use efficiency, quality of groundwater for irrigation, and nitrate content of both groundwater and crops. Economic indicators include crop productivity, net farm income, benefit-cost ratio of production, and per capita food grain production. Social indicators encompass food self-sufficiency, equality in food and income distribution among farmers, access to resources and support services, and farmers' knowledge and awareness of resource conservation. This article suggests that the selection of indicators representing each aspect of sustainability should be prioritized according to spatial and temporal characteristics under consideration.

AB This study aimed at clarifying the impact of deforestation and afforestation on the quality of life in a village in Sichuan Province, China. We devised a conceptual model of bioresource production and use based on quantified energy flow. The basic structure of the model has three sectors: production, use, and externals. We developed comprehensive methodology to quantify the model. Bioresource use per person in 1997 was 3.7 GJ for food, 10.2 GJ for fodder, 0.2-0.4 GJ for building material, 12.8 GJ for fuel, and 1.8 GJ for fertilizer, totaling 28.6-28.8 GJ. We used four environmental indicators to evaluate bioresource production and use: a biological productivity indicator, a use-efficiency indicator, a supply-demand balance indicator, and a self-sufficiency indicator. Use of these indicators showed that supply-demand balance of fuel was dramatically improved from 30% to 85% by afforestation, but 99% of bioresource use still depends on domestic products. Thus, it is necessary to improve biological productivity and promote the efficient use of bioresources to achieve sustainable living in the area. Massive deforestation in the 1950s caused a direct shortage of building material and fuel wood. The shortage of wood led to a stagnation in the rebuilding of houses, and fuel wood was substituted with crop residues. Because crop residues had been used for fertilizer and fodder, their use as fuel caused a shortage of fertilizer and fodder. This was an indirect impact of deforestation on people's quality of life.

AB The Brundtland Commission report, Our Common Future, defined sustainable development as development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. Although the idea of sustainable development has been widely accepted, it has proved difficult to identify and implement policies and practices that promote sustainable economic growth. Some economists, environmental scientists and policy analysts believe that they can transform the consensus about sustainability into manageable practices. They propose to accomplish this feat with a set of new ideas about the relationships between the economy and the environment offered under the banner of 'natural capital'. An ideal account of natural capital would be one or more standard measures or models that would allow the direct comparison of environmental goods, like forests, fresh water and clean air, with economic goods, like money, capital and productivity. By bringing economic science and environmental science to an objective common ground, a natural capital model has the potential to provide a concrete means of comparing the economic and ecological costs and benefits of particular policies and programmes. This paper offers a survey and analysis of several new contributions to the formation of the natural capital concept from economists, ecologists, policy analysts, biometricians, foresters and a philosopher. The paper concludes that existing microeconomic theory may be 'ungreenable', if it is not reformulated. While macroeconomic approaches to natural capital have been more successful, they share the limitation that ecosystems and species are valued solely in monetary terms. These problems are taken to suggest that the development of a successful natural capital model may require economic theory to be recast to include non-monetary social preferences and values.

AB Valuation ultimately refers to the contribution of an item to meeting a specific goal or objective. Conventional economic valuation is based on the goal of allocative efficiency. But other social goals may be equally, if not more, important. For example, the goals of social fairness and ecological sustainability have been identified as being at least of the same level of importance as allocative efficiency. This paper looks at the role of social goals in determining the basis for valuation of natural capital and ecosystem services, and sketches the characteristics of a system of valuation that would give equal weight to all three of the major social goals mentioned above. It also places these goals within a more comprehensive conceptual model of the economy and its relationship to the ecological life support system in which it is embedded.

AB This paper argues on both theoretical and empirical grounds that, beyond a certain point, there is an unavoidable conflict between economic development (generally taken to mean 'material economic growth') and environmental protection. Think for a moment of natural forests, grasslands, marine estuaries, salt marshes, and coral reefs; and of arable soils, aquifers, mineral deposits, petroleum, and coal. These are all forms of 'natural capital' that represent highly-ordered self-producing ecosystems or rich accumulations of energy/matter with high use potential (low entropy). Now contemplate despoiled landscapes, eroding farmlands, depleted fisheries, anthropogenic greenhouse gases, acid rain, poisonous mine tailings and toxic synthetic compounds. These all represent disordered systems or degraded forms of energy and matter with little use potential (high entropy). The main thing connecting these two states is human economic activity. Ecological economics interprets the environment-economy relationship in terms of the second law of thermodynamics. The second law sees economic activity as a dissipative process. From this perspective, the production of economic goods and services invariably requires the consumption of available energy and matter. To grow and develop, the economy necessarily 'feeds' on sources of high-quality energy/matter first produced by nature. This tends to disorder and homogenize the ecosphere, The ascendance of humankind has consistently been accompanied by an accelerating rate of ecological degradation, particularly biodiversity loss, the simplification of natural systems and pollution. In short, contemporary political rhetoric to the contrary, the prevailing growth-oriented global development paradigm is fundamentally incompatible with long-term ecological and social sustainability. Unsustainability is not a technical nor economic problem as usually conceived, but rather a state of systemic incompatibility between a economy that is a fully-contained, growing, dependent sub-system of a non-growing ecosphere. Potential solutions fly in the face of contemporary development trends and cultural values.

AB The sustainability of development is closely linked to changes in total per capita wealth. This paper presents estimates of the wealth of nations for nearly 100 countries, broken down into produced assets, natural resources and human resources. While the latter is the dominant form of wealth in virtually all countries, in low income natural resource exporters the share of natural resources in total wealth is equal to the share of produced assets. For low income countries in general, cropland forms the vast majority of natural wealth. The analysis suggests the process of development can be viewed as one of portfolio management: sustainable development entails saving the rents from exhaustible resources, managing renewable resources sustainably, and investing savings in both produced assets and human resources.

AB Traditionally, decision-makers have relied on economic impact estimates derived from conventional economy-wide models. Conventional models lack the environmental linkages necessary for examining environmental stewardship and economic sustainability, and in particular the ability to assess the impact of policies on natural capital. This study investigates environmentally extended economic impact estimation on a regional scale using a case study region in the province of Alberta known as the Foothills Model Forest (FMF). Conventional economic impact models are environmentally extended in pursuit of enhancing policy analysis and local decision-making. It is found that the flexibility of the computable general equilibrium (CGE) modeling approach offers potential for environmental extension, with a solid grounding in economic theory. The CGE approach may be the tool of the future for more complete integrated environment and economic impact assessment.

The authors of this paper argue that debt-for-nature investment in microenterprise and ecological economic models are not distinct from neoclassical economic and development models that created the environmental, social and cultural crises in the first place. This case study shows that the world market accommodates only one model of development: unsustainable export-oriented production based on flexible labour markets, low wages, indebtedness and low cost production. Working standards in those micro-enterprises are eroded due to many factors, including indebtedness. What happened at a national level in non-industrial countries with the international debt crisis is now mirrored in individual indebtedness through microenterprise. Is current development policy creating a new form of indentured servitude? Medicinal plants, prior to commodification, were a source of women's power and upon commodification in international development projects, are the source of their exploitation.

A natural valuation of an ecosystem's services will arise in a market for developmental rights in the ecosystem using a unit of tradable 'right': E-Scrip. The amount of e-scrip needed for a development may be set by Environmental Assessment. The capacity of the ecosystem to regenerate with developmental pressure may be represented by an independent trader or Factor Proxy for the Environment who provides e-scrip to the market.

AB An experiment was conducted in order to investigate hay yield and nitrogen harvest in single and binary grass (tall wheat grass (Agropyron elongatum), creasted wheat grass (Agropyron cristaturn), and smooth brome grass (Bromus inermis) mixtures with sainfoin (Onobrychis sativa) and alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.)) for 3 years between 1986 and 1989 under dry land conditions in Erzurum, Turkey. The hay yield, nitrogen harvest, protein concentration and land equivalent ratio (LER) in the mixtures were investigated under fertilized and unfertilized conditions. The mixtures were sown with legumes in crossing lines. Seeding rates were 8.0 g m(-2) in sainfoin, 4.0 g m(-2) in alfalfa, and 3.0 g m(-2) in grasses. 2.2 g m(-2) P in autumn, and 5.0 g m(-2) N were applied in spring to one of each subplots. The contribution of the mixtures of alfalfa and sainfoin with grasses to the hay yield differed between years. Legume mixtures with one or two grass species gave higher dry matter yield than the single crop. Use of fertilizers increased the hay yield, which was statistically significant (P < 0.01) in all combinations. Under fertilized and unfertilized conditions the crop yield was higher in the presence of Onobrychis with one or two grass species than mixture of grasses with alfalfa. The superiority of the mixtures was also reflected in their large N harvests compared to pure stands of sainfoin or alfalfa and pure grasses. Furthermore the protein concentration of the hay from the mixtures was higher than that of B. inermis, A. elongatum, or Agropyron cristatum but lower than M. sativa. The hay from sole O. sativa plots had the highest crude protein concentration (172 mg g(-1)). The LER values of grass mixtures were higher in both single and binary grass mixtures in presence of Medicago (1.10, 1.22) and OnobrYchis (1.08, 1.11, respectively) than those of their pure stands. In conclusion, for a sustainable production of high quality hay and greater N harvest with fertilizer, two grass species mixtures of sainfoin are recommended for long-purpose stands under similar conditions. Lower yields were harvested in the unfertilized plots and therefore fertilizer application is required probably because of insufficient P. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

ID SOIL SEEDBANK; MANAGEMENT; POPULATIONS; DYNAMICS; SYSTEMS; BANKS
AB Extensification has recently become an important option in Western European agriculture, driven both by economic considerations (product surpluses) and growing public concern on the possible adverse effects of intensive farming on the environment and human health. The adoption of rational fodder crop rotations, with the rediscovery of the beneficial effect of the meadow, is viewed as a possible means to reduce the impact of farming systems in the lowlands of northern Italy, characterised by highly intensive cropping and animal husbandry. Crop rotations are also expected to exert a positive effect in controlling the weed flora, thereby reducing the need for chemicals and increasing the sustainability of fanning. The current study examined, by the 'seedling emergence' technique, the quanti-qualitative composition of the potential weed flora (seed bank in the 0-20 and 20-40 cm soil layers) at the end of the second cycle (12 years since establishment) of a long-term crop rotation trial in northern Italy. The experiment compared five fodder crop systems, different in the degree of crop intensification and for the presence or absence of the meadow: a 1-year continuous cereal double cropping (R 1); a 3-year rotation (R3); a 6-year rotation (R6); a permanent meadow (PM); and a continuous grain maize cropping (CM). Each rotation was subjected to two input treatments, defined as optimal and sub-optimal (input reduction of approximate to25-30%) for the region, respectively, in terms of nutrient levels, herbicide doses, and soil tillage methods. The crop rotations exerted a marked influence on the potential weed flora, both qualitatively (mean number of weed species) and quantitatively (number of emerged weed seedlings m (-2)). Long rotations and maize monoculture had opposite trends with respect to the weed species diversity, the latter showing the narrower composition of the weed flora. The rotations including grain maize (viz., CM and R3) showed the highest seed stock, whereas the PM had the lowest weed infestation. Grain maize was particularly infested by warm-season, weed grasses, such as Digitaria sanguinalis and Panicum spp., against which neither the spring herbicide nor the post-emergence cultivation seemed effective. The meadow also showed an outstanding 'cleansing' effect when inserted into the R6 rotation after 3 years of annual double cropping, reducing to about one-third the initial seed stock. The input levels did not influence significantly the weed seed bank, suggesting the possibility of adopting less intensive agronomic practices without markedly worse weed control.

AB The idea of "Delay and Disruption" within projects is well-known and is often the subject of litigation claims. However, the term is ill-defined. and it is difficult to justify such claims within a legal process. This paper demonstrates a well-developed approach. which is a logical. transparent. auditable and sustainable means of presenting such a claim. It describes the format for a claim document that presents first the disruptive triggers. then using it formal qualitative model builds the case from the interacting effects of these triggers. Transformation of this model into a computer simulation and the ability to explore different scenarios provides the quantitative part of the claim document. Thus three elements are presented in the document: demonstration of causality. of responsibility and of it quantum for the claim. This process also provides additional benefits. including a high level of participant "buy-in". and the basis of a model that can be used to support the claim, (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

TI A survey of Phalaris minor in the Indian rice-wheat system
SO EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
AB A combination of agro-ecological and socioeconomic factors gave rise to the current weed epidemic of Phalaris minor, threatening the sustainability of wheat (Titicum aestivum) production and rural livelihoods across a large area of the Indo-Gangetic plains in northern India. This paper presents the results of a system audit describing the current status of the P minor epidemic in Haryana State, India, in a broad agronomic and socioeconomic context. The audit showed that the P minor epidemic is a major production constraint for many farmers, and seriously affects farm profitability. It suggests that the epidemic is closely entangled with geographic factors, as well as farm management systems and farmers' socioeconomic positions. Since the farmer community is not a homogeneous group with respect to P minor management, nor in ability to change farm management practices, farmers are not equally receptive to technical innovations aimed at improving sustainability of wheat production.

TI Developing improved dryland cropping systems for maize in semi-arid
   Tanzania. Part 11. Use of a model to extrapolate and add value to
   experimental results
SO EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
AB Dryland agriculture is critically important to food security and rural livelihoods in Tanzania, but crop production is seriously constrained throughout the semi-arid lowlands by the rainfall regime. A major challenge is to develop improved cropping systems to alleviate the moisture constraint. Experimental evidence indicates that adoption of rainwater harvesting systems can bring benefits, but the restricted spatial and temporal extent of the experimental work leads to difficulties in extrapolation. This paper shows how the PARCHED-THIRST model can add value to the experimental results and provide important insights into their transferability. The model is seen as an aid to researchers, planners and extensionists in interpreting experimental results and designing locally appropriate interventions. Simulation based on 30 years of daily meteorological data provides an opportunity for temporal extrapolation. The long-term simulation allows an objective assessment of the risks and benefits associated with alternative rainwater harvesting systems. Simulation for different soils and modified rainfall regimes permits objective analysis of spatial transferability of experimental results to any other site for which rainwater harvesting interventions might be considered. It is shown that macrocatchment rainwater harvesting reduces drought risk within the target area, but may bring a serious risk of erosion due to excessively high flow rates. The overall assessment of the twin-track approach (experimentation + simulation) is that rainwater harvesting has potential for increasing productivity and sustainability of maize cropping systems in semi-arid Tanzania provided that the innovations are properly matched to the site-specific environmental conditions.

AB Sustaining a successful program over times is critical in today's rapidly changing health care environment. This study sought to identify the characteristics of organizations that implemented innovative health programs for older adults and sustained those programs over time. The Gerontological Health Section of the American Public Health Association created an award in 1998, endowed by the Archstone Foundation, to recognize innovative programs providing health and related social support services to older adults. The 20 award winners were interviewed in Fall 2002, using a structured questionnaire based on the conceptual model for sustainability articulated by Shediac-Rizkallah and Bone. The findings provided insights into the importance of leadership, financing, organizational structure, governance, marketing, and evaluation/research.

TI Improving efficiency in a residency training clinic: Results from
   addressing a root cause of inefficiency
SO FAMILY MEDICINE
LA English

ID PRIMARY-CARE; EDUCATION; MEDICINE
AB Background: Since the early 1980s, primary care teaching clinics have repeatedly been reported to be inefficient. This paper describes the results of a 5-year effort to improve the efficiency of our residency teaching clinic. Methods: This 5-year longitudinal tracking study of a clinic monitored monthly patient volume, number of providers scheduled per half day, and patient satisfaction with waiting times while interventions occurred to improve clinic efficiency. Results: Prior to rigorously tracking the number of providers in clinic, monthly clinic patient volume increased temporarily (1998-1999) but fell back to baseline the following year Variation in the number of providers in clinic explained nearly half the variability in the number of patients seen. After beginning a process of tracking and proactively optimizing the number of providers in clinic per half day, patient volumes increased significantly and stabilized at the higher levels. Patient satisfaction with waiting time improved slightly. Conclusions: Tracking and optimizing a single operational variable can improve clinic performance significantly. Reducing the variation in the number of providers scheduled to see patients toward an optimum number based on the number of available exam rooms resulted in sustainable increases in the number of patients seen without any negative impact on the patient satisfaction with waiting times.

AB Increased economic and financial integration and substantial macroeconomic fluctuations require that corporate managers and investment analysts pay more attention than in the past to the link between the "noise" that these fluctuations represent and the company's performance-past and future. For many reasons, company managers must weed out the effects of the noise to obtain a clear picture of the company's intrinsic competitiveness and long-term sustainable profits. The question is: To what extent can outside shareholders and investment analysts adopt this approach to corporate performance? Current reporting practice does not provide these outsiders with an adequate idea of the character and magnitude of the impact of macroeconomic variables on the company. The recommendations of International Accounting Standard 1, Presentation of Financial Statements (as revised in 1997), however, offer an improvement in this important area. This article presents four levels of implementation of IAS 1 and what these levels mean in terms of relevant information transmitted to outsiders. Illustrations are provided of current practices in two global industries and of a release that would meet the informational demands of shareholders and analysts.

TI Lesser used species of Bolivia and their relevance to sustainable forest
   management
SO FOREST PRODUCTS JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB Bolivia has extensive forest resources and potential to become one of the world's largest producers of tropical wood. However, this potential is currently constrained due to the depletion of Bolivia's top commercial timber species (mahogany, Spanish cedar, and South American oak). To insure that Bolivia's forestry sector contributes to the growth of the national economy and stimulates investments in sustainable forest management, timber harvests need to include currently underutilized species. Augmenting demand for lesser used species (LUS) is necessary to sustain the value of forest resources. Limiting the potential for LUS is a scarcity and inaccessibility of information regarding their wood properties. This paper discusses the relevance of LUS research and wood property information to countries focusing forest sector development on secondary and value-added forest products. We also list potentially valuable, yet under-exploited timber species in Bolivia and species that need further wood property research.

AB This paper is a summary of an assessment of the forest community's progress toward meeting its commitment to the Canadian Biodiversity Strategy of maintaining the extent, diversity and health of a large portion of the world's temperate and boreal forests. The past decade's success with current sustainable forest management programs has been important in achieving Canada's custodial responsibilities. So, too, is our enviable position of a high degree of public ownership of forests, the wilderness nature of most northern forests and limited development that has largely retained forests in their natural state. As Canada develops a new National Forest Strategy, there is again the opportunity to examine emerging issues and develop new programs to meet the challenges over the next five years. Canada has made considerable progress in achieving a strong commitment to biodiversity conservation by establishing a variety of new mechanisms to monitor and deliver programs. The Canadian Biodiversity Strategy is a long-term commitment that requires sustained resources and co-operation from a variety of governmental, industry and community interests.

AB Over the last decade, the Canadian forest industry has evolved towards a new industrial model that acknowledges the interconnectivity of environment, economy and society. The emerging model rests on two pillars, "Embracing Sustainability" and "New Partnerships with People and Communities" that support a pro-active, scientifically driven approach to sustainable management and a flexible, collaborative attitude to stakeholder relations. It is based on increasingly sophisticated strategies that recognize the global and local influences on resource management, community requirements and consumer behaviour. Gradual, voluntary adoption of this model is improving environmental stewardship, strengthening industry's commitment to the social needs of partner communities, protecting economic investment and future profitability, and improving stakeholder relations in resource management. The factors influencing this evolving industrial model are both global and uniquely Canadian. By voluntarily investing in co-operative research and policy development, by advocating and adopting international standards and certification, and by adopting a corporate social responsibility framework, the Canadian forest products industry is pushing itself and other stakeholders to build a future based on environmental, social and economic sustainability.

CL OTTAWA, CANADA
DE Canada; private woodlots; stewardship; sustainable forest management;
   woodlot owner organizations; government programs and services
AB Woodlots have been a prominent part of the Canadian rural landscape since the European settlement of Canada. In addition to their social and economic importance, woodlots contribute significantly to the environment. Their importance varies widely among provinces but nearly 10% of Canadian non-reserved productive forests are woodlots. Woodlots belong to over 450 000 families whose reasons for owning them are diverse. The annual average revenue from a woodlot is low but, as a whole, they play a valuable economic role in the forest industry's wood supply. Total woodlot owner annual revenues are estimated at $1.5 billion (Canadian). Managing a private woodlot in a sustainable way is a challenge with economic and environmental dimensions, which is easier met with support from society. Three types of tools have been developed to support the stewardship commitment of woodlot owners: woodlot owner organisations, laws and regulations (including tax legislation) and incentive and support programs. It is difficult to foresee what the future holds for woodlot owners but important issues are identified: expansion of regulations, limits to market access and prices that do not reflect the costs of sustainable practices, growing fragmentation of woodlots and an increase in single-use ownership, decline of the contribution of woodlots to the economy and a less active contribution to environmental services. Potential outcomes are explored. With a complete, widely available set of financial and educational tools, owners will increase the production of a range of goods and services. Provincial government policies that offset market distortions, that provide financial support for silviculture and the costs of environmental services and natural disasters, and income and property tax policies that encourage sustainable practices will be essential tools in supporting the efforts of woodlot owners to realize the full potential of the forest resource they collectively own.

AB Many factors influence forestry in Canada; one gaining prominence is the practice of Aboriginal forestry. "What is Aboriginal forestry?" and "What are the driving forces behind Aboriginal forestry advancement?" are questions that are addressed in this paper. Aboriginal forestry can be seen as sustainable forest land use practices that incorporate the cultural protocols of the past with interactions between the forest ecosystem and today's Aboriginal people for generations unborn. Aboriginal forestry combines the strengths of current forest management models with traditional cultural Aboriginal forest practice. Aboriginal forestry practice is more than just following a prescription outlining when, where, and how to harvest, but prescribes how a respectful relationship with the natural world can be developed. There have been several factors driving Aboriginal forestry: forest certification, landmark court cases on Aboriginal rights and title, meaningful consultation and accommodation of potential infringements upon Aboriginal rights, modern treaty-making processes, and modern comprehensive and specific claims and treaty land entitlements. These lead to greater recognition and involvement of Aboriginal people in forestry.

AB Sustainable correction of severe human genetic disorders of self-renewing tissues, such as the blistering skin disease junctional epidermolysis bullosa (JEB), is facilitated by stable genomic integration of therapeutic genes into somatic tissue stem cells. While integrating viral vectors can achieve this, they suffer from logistical and biosafety concerns. To circumvent these limitations, we used the Sleeping Beauty transposable element to integrate the LAMB3 cDNA into genomes of epidermal holoclones from six unrelated JEB patients. These cells regenerate human JEB skin that is normalized at the level of laminin 5 protein expression, hemidesmosome formation and blistering. Transposon-mediated gene delivery therefore affords an opportunity for stable gene delivery in JEB and other human diseases.

AB Conditional activation and inactivation of genes using the Cre/IoxP recombination system is a powerful tool for the analysis of gene function and for tracking cell fate. Here we report a novel silent EGFP reporter mouse line generated by enhancer trap technology using embryonic stem (ES) cells. Following transfection with the silent EGFP reporter construct, positive ES cell clones were treated with Cre recombinase. These "activated clones" were then further selected on the basis of ubiquitous EGFP expression during in vitro differentiation. The parental "silent" clones were then used for generating mice. Upon Cre-mediated activation in ovo tissues tested from these mice express EGFP. Long-term, strong and sustainable expression of EGFP is observed in most myeloid and lymphoid cells. As shown by in vivo transplantation assays, the majority of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and spleen colony-forming units (CFU-S) reside within the EGFP positive fraction. Most in vitro colony-forming units (CFU-Cs) isolated from bone marrow also express EGFP. Thus, these reporter mice are useful for the analysis of Cre-mediated recombination in HSCs and hematopoietic progenitor cells. This, in combination with the high accessibility of the IoxP sites, makes these mice a valuable tool for testing cell/tissue-specific Cre-expressing mice. genesis 36:168-176, 2003.

TI Innovation, insurability and sustainable development: Sharing risk
   management between insurers and the state
SO GENEVA PAPERS ON RISK AND INSURANCE-ISSUES AND PRACTICE
LA English
DT Article
AB Both the public and the private sectors have responsibilities for managing the risks associated with new technologies. This article is about the interplay between three key concepts: the insurability of risk; innovation; and the broader framework of sustainable development. It is based on the recent EU INTEREST project(1) which addressed the role the insurance sector and insurance-based mechanisms might play in relation to innovation which promotes, or challenges, sustainable development. The project cast light on three issues: opportunities for promoting sustainable development through innovation by adjusting or sharing the responsibilities of private sector actors, regulators and policymakers; promoting sustainable development innovation by using risk management mechanisms from insurance in other domains or by the insurance sector using a wider set of tools to manage novel risks; and policy options for the complementary use of insurance-related and other risk management mechanisms.
   The article begins by considering, at a general level, the interplay between insurability, innovation and sustainability, before moving on to consider five specific contemporary case studies: the development of GM crops; the risks associated with xenotransplantation; nuclear power; the tapping of freshwater submarine springs in the Mediterranean area; and the management of flood risks. The paper then draws out broader conclusions about the use of risk management mechanisms to promote sustainable development innovation. It concludes, by considering implications for policymakers and insurers.

ID POLICY
AB This paper employs ecological footprint analysis as a potential non-monetary metric of human consumption and ecological productivity in a simulation-modeling framework, applied to North America. The ecological footprint provides an indirect basis for considering the long-term ecological risk and sustainability of human settlements, regions or, in this case, a continent. We examine several scenarios for human consumption, ecological productivity and material efficiency, to explore which variables have influence on the ecological budget of North America over the coming century. Only one scenario, which assumes considerable reductions in human consumption, is likely to yield an ecological surplus. Unlike monetary measures of societal well-being, ecological footprint analysis shows that increased economic activity and consumption creates deficits in terms of the balance of ecological productivity and consumption in a region, and may reduce long-term ecological sustainability. Several advantages and disadvantages of this metric are discussed. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Interbasin underflow between closed Altiplano Basins in Chile
SO GROUND WATER
LA English
DT Article
AB Interbasin ground water movement of 200 to 240 L/sec occurs as underflow beneath a mountainous surface water divide separating the topographically higher Salar de Michincha from the topographically lower Salar de Coposa internally drained basins in the Altiplano of northern Chile. Salt-encrusted flats (salars) and saline lakes occur on the lowest parts of the basin floors and comprise the principal evaporative discharge areas for the basins. Because a surface water divide separates the basins, surface water drainage boundaries do not coincide with ground water drainage boundaries. In the region, interbasin ground water movement is usually not recognized, but occurs for selected basins, and at places is an important component of ground water budgets. With increasing development of water for mining industry and potential exportation of ground water from the Altiplano for use at coastal cities, demonstration and quantification of interbasin movement is important for assessment of sustainable ground water development in a region of extreme aridity. Recognition and quantification of interbasin ground water underflow will assist in management of ground water resources in the and Chilean Altiplano environment.

DT Article
DE embryonic stem cells; embryo; right to health; research freedom;
   preimplantation diagnostics
AB Although Germany does not have a law for reproductive medicine, a law governing embryonic stem cells has existed since 2002. Having such a law is legally and politically wise. It stipulates that the import of embryonic stem cells into Germany is allowable only in certain cases. However, the law is unclear in many areas. It stands in latent contradiction to the duty of the health care system to enhance medical and therapeutic research and the freedom of scientists to conduct their research. One concrete problem with the. law is the regulation by date which prevents the import of younger, better quality stem cells. A further problem is that the law results in a moral double standard because Germany uses stem cells for its own research but only when produced in other countries. In the future development of other legal regulations - for example, governing the practice of preimplantation diagnostics such a double standard should be avoided.

TI Sustainability assessment of aluminum heat sink design
SO HEAT TRANSFER ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
AB The present effort addresses the application of sustainability criteria to the design of "heat sinks" used to cool advanced microelectronic components. The sustainability assessment is based on several criteria, including the use of natural resources, the environment, social welfare, and economic impact. The development of forced convection heat sinks, which are compatible with sustainable development, involves a subtle balance between the achieved thermal performance and the investment of material and energy in the fabrication and operation of the heat sink. It is shown that sustainability criteria can be used to select the environmentally optimal configuration among the most promising heat sink designs, including the lowest pumping power, the least mass of material, and the lowest total (fabrication and operation) energy for a specified application. Of the options considered for cooling a 100 W microprocessor with an aluminum heat sink operating at an excess temperature of 25 K, the heat sink design with the lowest total energy consumption was found to display the highest Sustainability Index.

Measurements of a pressure rise in the system simultaneously with the chromatographic analysis of the gas mixture sampled from the reactor showed that the product buildup kinetics were determined by the discharge character: when the discharge was maintained in the form of multiple sparks throughout the,gauze-filled volume, the highest degradation rate was observed and all the products detected, including benzene, accumulated linearly with respect to the amount of methane decomposed. In the case of the formation of a local discharge zone in which the gauze was heated to a yellow heat, the benzene buildup followed a nonlinear law, its formation rate increased a few times with an increase in the degree of methane conversion. Although the total methane decomposition rate was lower in this case, conversion into benzene turned out to be a few times greater than in the previous experiment. For example, no more than 10-20% of methane decomposed within a discharge time of 10 min, whereas its conversion to benzene reached 10-15%.

TI Building competitiveness and cohesion: The role of new housebuilding in

DE new housing; cities; competitiveness; cohesion
ID GROWTH
AB This paper begins by mapping out the ways in which new private housebuilding may impinge on two of the key themes of contemporary urban policy, economic competitiveness and social cohesion. It then examines aspects of this relationship in more depth, drawing on evidence from Central Scotland. First, it considers the pattern of new housing provision in two adjacent city regions. Second, it examines buyers' choice of new housing per se and between higher density, urban locations versus lower density suburban locations for new housing. Third, it looks at the role of new building in promoting social cohesion/integration. A mixture of sources of evidence are drawn on, particularly surveys of residents of selected new housing schemes and existing neighbourhoods in Central Scotland, but also linked analyses of planning and market data. The conclusions draw attention to the significant role of new housebuilding in supporting city competitiveness and regeneration, at the same time as its rather uneven contribution to sustainability and balanced communities becomes apparent. This leads to some positive pointers for policy while recognising the inherent conflicts between different dimensions of social cohesion.

DE environmental issues; sustainability; housing studies; housing policy
AB This paper takes stock of the housing and environment debate and argues that much of the optimism of the early 1990s has declined. Our own work is reviewed as an example of the limits of previous approaches to analysing contemporary housing and environmental issues. There appears to be a paradox in that housing organisations are now much more environmentally aware; many are developing green housing projects, and yet the development of theory has lagged behind. It is argued that the analysis of environmental issues in housing studies needs to be strongly linked to wider debates and cross-cutting themes such as social and economic sustainability, social integration and fair competition in the context of globalisation.

AB Current UK housing policy favours high-density, mixed-use development on previously developed urban land. This ties in with a general policy to promote an 'urban renaissance', largely because of its claimed advantages for sustainability. However, there has been little testing to date of sustainability impacts in practice. This is particularly true for the social equity aspect of sustainability, despite its acknowledged centrality to the concept. This paper outlines the development of a theory of social equity in relation to urban form and presents empirical research based on this to test the case of the so-called 'compact city', that is, high-density, mixed-use urban form. The research involved a comparative investigation of a range of alleged social equity impacts in 25 medium-sized English cities of differing levels and types of compactness. The findings suggest that, in certain respects and with certain qualifications, the compact city has the potential to promote social equity. Likely benefits include reduced car dependency and lower levels of social segregation, while the main problem is likely to be a lack of affordable, decent-sized homes. Positive effects are emerging in response to re-urbanisation and development on derelict land, and the cities which most support equity appear to be those that have a large proportion of high-density housing and a large quantity of locally provided services and facilities.

AB This paper critically examines the widely held belief that social costs of growth, such as congestion, pollution and sprawl, can be stemmed by compact, mixed-use, design solutions. It is argued instead that when considering the future of cities, we have to actively engage in debates concerning the future of work and changes in the structure and composition of households. Discussion draws on household level research conducted in three West Coast US cities (Portland, Seattle and San Francisco) representing a hierarchy of size, status and growth management. Detailed analysis of 60 two-wage household 'biographies' highlights the way decision making (and ultimately compromise) shapes human-environment interaction. Evidence is presented which shows high levels of dissonance between stated preference for compact, mixed-use neighbourhoods and non-localised lived relations between different daily activities and communities. The results of this inter-city comparative study are discussed with reference to US (and UK) environmental policies currently favouring planning-led behavioural change.

TI 2. Livelihood dynamics: Rural Mozambique, South Africa and Zimbabwe
SO IDS BULLETIN-INSTITUTE OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
AB Drawing on research carried out by the Sustainable Livelihoods in Southern Africa (SLSA) programme, this article gives a brief overview of some of the diverse ways people make a living in harsh physical and economic environments in Zambezia province, Mozambique, Chiredzi district Zimbabwe and South Africa's Wild Coast. It describes the contexts of increasing vulnerability, including the impact of economic reform programmes, the spread of HIV/AIDS and the incidence of extreme climatic events. It explores the livelihood Strategies of rural people and the emergence of new institutional and governance arrangements that facilitate or constrain these strategies. It demonstrates that gaining access to natural resources continues to play, alongside a portfolio of other activities, a crucial part in rural people's livelihood strategies.

TI 4. Politics and water policy: A southern Africa example
SO IDS BULLETIN-INSTITUTE OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
ID ZIMBABWE; DROUGHT
AB Drawing on fieldwork from the Sustainable Livelihoods in Southern Africa programme largely "undertaken in Zimbabwe, with some additional material from South Africa and Mozambique - this article examines the politics surrounding water resources and policy change in southern Africa. It outlines the policy contexts of water reforms in the three countries. The article then investigates: the process of institution-building accompanying water policy reform and resulting complex and politicised institutional layering; the contested meanings attached to water by different stakeholders and their implications for new institutions and decision-making processes; and the significance of the "grey area" between domestic and commercial water usage to an understanding of the role of water in household livelihoods. It draws some conclusions as to possible policy development and implementation options that could address these critical issues.

TI 6. The rural poor, the private sector and markets: Changing interactions
   in southern Africa
SO IDS BULLETIN-INSTITUTE OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
AB Drawing on case study material from the Sustainable Livelihoods in Southern Africa programme, this article examines the turn to strategies for development in southern Africa, which seek to boost the access of the rural poor to new markets and investment opportunities. It investigates the prospects for "pro-poor" engagement with the private sector, and lists a number of policy measures needed in order to make such initiatives work for the benefit of rural livelihoods. Markets are highly politicised, the playing field is uneven and, without regulation and protection, poor communities are vulnerable to potential exploitation. Without concerted attention to improving the capacity of poor people to enter and engage with markets and to the distribution of benefits - through active state support and redistributive measures - the ideals of "pro-poor growth" and "private sector partnership" for development will remain more rhetorical gloss than reality.

TI 8. Rights talk and rights practice: Challenges for southern Africa
SO IDS BULLETIN-INSTITUTE OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
ID LEGAL PLURALISM
AB Rights are increasingly enshrined in legislative frameworks in southern Africa and rights-based approaches are increasingly seen as a core component of development. But how can rights be made real for poor people in rural areas? Research in Mozambique, South Africa and Zimbabwe sheds light on the practice of rights claiming on the ground, in the context of "legal pluralism" and complex, politicised institutional settings. Rather than an emphasis on rights in abstract legal or constitutional terms, the research has explored instead the practices of rights claiming and the complex politics of actors and institutions that affect this. In the southern African context, rights are formulated and claimed in a very unlevel playing field and are highly contested. In practice, rights are realised through complex negotiations about access to resources at a local level. Broader rights frameworks enshrined in the constitution, in legislation and in policy can - despite their progressive nature - be irrelevant, unless the local institutional context is conducive to encouraging effective rights claiming by poor people. A rights-based approach for sustainable livelihoods must therefore concentrate on institutional mechanisms for gaining access to resources, rather than only on establishing universalised legalistic rights frameworks.

TI 9. Endpiece: The politics of livelihood opportunity
SO IDS BULLETIN-INSTITUTE OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
AB This brief article draws together some of the conclusions of the Sustainable Livelihoods in Southern Africa programme. This research has sought to move beyond simple technical/managerial "good governance" solutions to sketch the contours of a realistic, but politically sophisticated, sustainable livelihoods approach. The key policy challenges include: instituting real redistributive reforms, particularly of land; redressing imbalances in market entry and engagement; making decentralisation really work to poor people's advantage; and realising rights increasingly enshrined in progressive legislative frameworks. These face formidable obstacles - and a sustainable livelihoods approach must be rooted in an understanding of the historical legacies and contemporary political/administrative and economic contexts in southern Africa. Such an endeavour would, for example, support mobilisation, lobbying, civic organisation and new alliances around a pluralist and activist politics for livelihood improvement and create links to party-based democratic politics; build on and transform forms of patrimonialism and establish strategic linkages between elites and the poor; and abandon the artificial and misleading separation of public/private, state/non-state in both analysis and prescription.

TI Modified patchwork algorithm: A novel audio watermarking scheme
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SPEECH AND AUDIO PROCESSING
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper presents the Modified Patchwork Algorithm (MPA), a statistical technique for audio watermarking algorithm in the transform (not only Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), but also DFT and DWT) domain. The MPA is an enhanced version of the conventional patchwork algorithm. The MPA is sufficiently robust to withstand some attacks defined by Secure Digital Music Initiative (SDMI). Experimental results show that the proposed watermarking algorithm is sustainable against compression algorithms such as MP3 and AAC, as well as common signal processing manipulation attacks.

AB The data of a long-term experiment on nutrient management in cropping systems conducted under the Project Directorate for Cropping Systems Research, Modipuram, for Navasari (Gujarat) (1987-98) and Rajendranagar (Andhra Pradesh) (1988-98) centres were analysed to evaluate the effect of fertilizers in combination with organic manures on the productivity of cereal-based crop sequences and also to examine whether the yields exhibited trend over the years. The experiment included 12 treatments of fertilizers in combination with organic manure in randomized complete-block design. The analysis revealed that the maximum yield (3.486 tonnes/ha of rice and 2.154 tonnes/ha of wheat) of rice (Oryza sativa L.)-wheat (Triticum aestivum L.emend. Fiori & Paul.) sequence at the Navasari centre was realized when 100% of the recommended NPK dose (100, 50, 0 kg/ha of N, P2O5, K2O for rice and 120, 60, 0 kg/ha of N, P2O5 K2O for wheat) was applied to both the crops through fertilizers. However, 50% recommended NPK dose through fertilizers when supplemented with 50% N equivalent through green-manure in rice, followed,by 106% recommended NPK dose through fertilizers in wheat proved a better practice from the long-term sustainability of crop yields. Further, 50% recommended NPK dose (60, 30, 30 kg/ha of N, P2O5 K2O) through fertilizers with 50% N equivalent through green-manure in rainy season rice, followed by 100%recommended NPK dose (120,60, 60 kg/ha of N, P2O5, K2O) through, fertilizers in winter rice was the most appropriate fertilization practice for obtaining the highest yield (4.926 tonnes/ha of rainy-season rice and 4.192 tonnes/ha of winter rice) of the rice-rice crop sequence at the. Rajendranagar centre.

ID ETHANOL; CORN
AB An ethanol soluble protein (zein) can be extracted from maize meal. Development of a cost effective protein recovery process requires that the extracted maize particles be separated from the extract. We have previously shown that the particles can be settled into a water layer, through a stagnant interface, with low dilution of the protein-containing extract liquid. In this article, we describe testing done to develop settling tank base inclinations that enable the settled particles to be pumped from the tank as rapidly as they settle to the water layer. Ethanol extracts were pumped to one side of an ethanol solution layer floating on a water layer. The ethanol solution was kept at a constant height by pumping from a port opposite and higher than the inlet port and by maintenance of a constant water layer height. The solid particles in the extract settled into the water. Water was continuously pumped to and from the tank. Laminar water flow alone did not remove the particles at the lowest sustainable extract feed rate. Particles could be pumped out of the tank at rates equal to practical rates of extract feed when they settled on a base inclined 35degrees to the horizontal. The rate of extract liquid entrainment by the settling particles was determined from measurements of the mass of the solids settled into the water layer and the density of the dilute ethanol solution pumped from the bottom of the tank. The mass ratio of the extract liquid lost:solid particle settled was similar to the corresponding ratio for decanter centrifugation. Settling promises to be a cost-effective method of separating extracted particles from alcoholic extracts with low extract liquid dilution. Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Over the past decade, education reform and teacher training projects have spent a great deal of effort to create and support sustainable, scalable online communities of education professionals. For the most part, those communities have been created in isolation from the existing local professional communities within which the teachers practice. We argue that focusing on online technology solely as a mechanism to deliver training and/or create online networks places the cart before the horse by ignoring the Internet's even greater potential to help support and strengthen local communities of practice within which teachers work. In this article we seek guideposts to help education technologists understand the nature of local K-12 education communities of practice-specifically their reciprocal relationship with teacher professional development and instructional improvement interventions-as a prerequisite to designing online sociotechnical infrastructure that supports the professional growth of education professionals.

ID RECONSTRUCTION
AB In the light of fresh international initiatives to achieve Universal Basic Education and gender equality in education by 2015, this paper examines factors affecting its realisation in the context of Somaliland. In a 'country' where over 80% of the school age population are receiving little meaningful education, the paper reflects on more flexible approaches to education to enable sustainable education for children and disadvantaged adults. The paper draws on fieldwork data from a DfID-funded study (DFID ED2000/107) and the authors' own experiences.
   The discussion highlights the peculiar circumstances of Somaliland. It charts the provision of Education in Somaliland from the colonial era through post-independence times to the civil conflict which led to the destruction of education in the country. It goes on to look at the progress being made at the present time following 'stop-gap' measures for emergency education towards revitalising enhanced education. It completes the picture by describing challenges to the achievement of the UBE target.
   The authors review aspects of alternative and flexible educational approaches and urge the integration of these nonformal systems with the formal, governmentally controlled school systems being restored in Somaliland. They do so while sounding a note of caution that for all the energy and enthusiasm associated with these approaches, they have yet to be evaluated for their effectiveness in providing quality basic education.

AB Growing concerns about global climate change, biodiversity maintenance, natural resources conservation, and long-term ecosystem sustainability have been responsible for the transformation of traditional single resource management approaches into integrated ecosystem management models. Eco-regions are large ecosystems of regional extent that contain smaller ecosystems of similar response potential and resource production capabilities. They can be used as a geographical framework for organizing and reporting resource information, setting bioecological recovery criteria, extrapolating site-level management, and monitoring global change. The objective of this research is to develop a quantitative, multivariate regionalization model that is capable of delineating eco-regions at multiple levels from remotely sensed information and other environmental and natural resources spatial data. The Spatial Pattern Analysis Model developed in this study uses a region-growing algorithm to generate spatially contiguous regions from primitive polygonal land units. The algorithm merges the most similar pair of neighbouring units at each iteration, based on satisfying certain similarity criteria until all units are grouped into one. This model was utilized to develop an eco-region map of Nebraska with three hierarchical levels. In the mapping process, the STATSGO data set was used to build the primitive map units. Environmental parameters included in the model were multi-temporal AVHRR data, soil rooting depth, organic matter content, available water capacity, and long-term annual averages of water balance and growing degree day totals. Development of the model provides a new and useful approach to eco-region mapping for resource managers and researchers. The method is automated and efficient, reduces the judgement biases and uncertainty of manual analyses, and can be replicated for other regions or for the regionalization of other themes.

AB Despite much discussion of the role of private health care providers, there are no tried and tested models for Supporting for-profit providers in ways that produce cost-effective public health outcomes. This paper examines the cost effectiveness of using a loan mechanism to motivate a for-profit provider to deliver family planning services. The intervention examined directly resulted in a private provider delivering family planning services, however, it did not create a long-term financial incentive for the private provider to promote the use of family planning. The cost effectiveness of this intervention is analysed using a methodology that captures long term sustainability of the intervention within a traditional family planning outcome measure, such as couple years protection (CYP), by discounting future expected CYPs. Depending on the method for analysing costs and assumptions regarding future CYPs, this intervention produced family planning outcomes at no or very low cost ($0-$4.11 per CYP). The analysis demonstrates that innovative family planning interventions with private providers should be considered as they can be more cost effective than traditional programmes.

AB The focus of the paper covers the current discussion on the contribution of fuel cell vehicles to so-called "sustainable mobility". It evaluates whether advantages for the environmental situation and energy carrier supply can be expected from the already visible future characteristics of fuel cell propulsion systems in the transport sector. This contribution therefore determines full fuel cycle data for the energy demand and emissions as well a economic data.
   The different paths of a hydrocarbon-based fuel supply are evaluated with respect to primary energy use and CO(2) emissions from the fuel cycle. The technical systems analysis of fuel cell propulsion systems was realised with dynamic simulation models for driving cycles. The energy consumption and emission reduction potentials in the German passenger car transport sector were estimated for the introduction of fuel cell propulsion systems. Therefore scenario calculations were carried out to indicate how the results of the single analysis of technology and fuel supply concepts affect the German transport sector.
   The application of fuel cell electric vehicles in comparison to advanced internal combustion engine vehicles identifies a small CO(2) emission reduction potential for the German transport sector depending on the assumed full fuel cycles. The reduction of limited emissions can be expected to be much greater, which can help to reduce local smog problems.

AB Clinical guidelines can improve the quality of care in multiple trauma. In our Department of Trauma Surgery a specific guideline is available paper-based as a set of flowcharts. This format is appropriate for the use by experienced physicians but insufficient for electronic support of learning, workflow and process optimization. A format and logically consistent version represented with a standardized meta-model, is necessary for automatic processing. In our project we transferred the paper-based into an electronic format and analyzed the structure with respect to format errors. Several errors were detected in seven error categories. The errors were corrected to reach a formally and logically consistent process model. In a second step the clinical content of the guideline was revised interactively using a process-modeling tool Our study reveals that guideline development should be assisted by process modeling toots, which check the content in comparison to a meta-model. The meta-model itself could support the domain experts in formulating their knowledge systematically. To assure sustainability of guideline development a representation independent of specific applications or specific provider is necessary. Then, clinical guidelines could be used for eLearning, process optimization and workflow management additionally. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Improvement of farmers' decision-making has been recognised as critical for the implementation of IPM, yet practitioners lack sound knowledge on the `how and why' of farmers' decision-making processes. This study explored the perceptions, pest management practice, decision tools and sources of information of smallholder farmers growing cotton in India and vegetables in Kenya. Farmers trained under an Insecticide Resistance Management and two IPM Farmer Field School projects were compared with untrained farmers from the same localities, using individual interviews and participatory group analysis methods. Trained farmers' decision-making was enhanced, by the use of more decision tools and new sources of information and technologies and they were generally more con. dent in their pest management strategies than untrained farmers. As a result, trained farmers reduced their pest management costs but did not always obtain higher gross margins. Issues of gender, sustainability, economics and group action are discussed, along with recommendations for research and extension to take a closer look at farmers' decision-making processes in cash and subsistence crops.

AB This paper describes the development by the General Directorate of Rural Services (GDRS) of a land information system for Turkey, namely the National Soil and Water Information System. It is of great significance for the modern state of Turkey as, prior to its establishment in 1999 under the Turkish Agricultural Research Project, there was no definitive, national technological information resource underpinning land and water resource management. The system will support the operational and research responsibilities of the Directorate in combating some of the current environmental concerns in Turkey, including wind and water erosion, waterlogging, sodicity and salination of the soil resource. The complex process of compiling the first national digital soil map will be among the initial tasks, as well as establishing a national infrastructure for distributing the information amongst GDRS managers and scientists. With the proposed accession of the Turkish Republic to the European Union, alignment of the National Soil and Water Information System with European standards and protocols will prove to be an important facet of its ongoing development.

AB Agricultural land use has changed in the Mediterranean Region particularly since the 1950s. Factors affecting these changes include increasing agricultural productivity and intensification, changes in population density industrialization, urbanization, tourism, agricultural mechanization and use of agri-chemicals. Farms have been fragmented and the average farm size has decreased because of rapid rural population growth. During this period, most pasture and meadow land has been transformed into crop cultivation. Once productive farmlands have been used for industrialization, urbanization and tourist developments. For sustainable agricultural land use, new legal and institutional regulations are required, which integrate environmental concerns and agricultural policies. These regulations must be defined in terms of multiple use of agricultural land and strict conservation of prime agricultural land. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Biooxidation of ferrous iron (Fe(2+)) from strongly acidic industrial wastewater with a high Fe(2+) content by Thiobacillus ferrooxidans in a packed bed reactor and subsequent removal of ferric iron (Fe(3+)) by a crossflow microfiltration (membrane) process have been investigated as functions of wastewater flowrate (54-672 cm(3) h(-1)), Fe(2+) concentration (1.01-8.06 g dm(-3)), and pH (1.5-5.0). A natural (vegetable) sponge, Luffa cylindrica, was used as support matrix material. The fastest kinetic performance achieved was about 40 g Fe(2+) dm(-3) h(-1) at a true dilution rate of 19 h(-1) corresponding to a hydraulic retention time of 3.16 min. Steady state conversion was observed to be about 10% higher at pH 2.3 than that at pH 1.5. Increasing the flowrate of the inlet wastewater caused a reduction in conversion rate. The oxidation rate reduced along the reactor height as the wastewater moved towards the exit at the top but conversion showed the opposite trend. Increasing Fe(2+) concentration up to a critical point resulted in an increased oxidation rate but beyond the critical point caused the oxidation rate to decrease. Luffa cylindrica displayed suitable characteristics for use as a support matrix for formation of a Thiobacillus ferrooxidans biofilm and showed promising potential as an ecological and sustainable alternative to existing synthetic support materials. Membrane separation was shown to be a very effective means of Fe(3+) removal from the wastewater with removal changing from 92% at pH 2.3 to complete removal at pH 5.0.

AB Given the rapid urbanization of Turkey, sustained productivity of natural resources should. be an integral part of any urban development policy. The biogeochemical cycles and ecosystem services link urban and rural ecosystems. It is, therefore, essential that ecologically significant habitats along urban-rural continuum be protected to secure public and environmental health. This necessitates their identification and the establishment of administrative and legal foundations for urban nature conservation in the management of urban habitats. should,be established Ecological analysis of urban habitats of Karsiyaka led to the identification of 19 ecologically significant habitats. Nature conservation priority was rated, using rarity, species richness, stratification, site age, and area of the habitats. Ecologically significant habitats made up about 54 ha of the total urban green space of 289 ha in Karsiyaka. The total number of plant species was estimated to be 273.

AB The Model Sustainable Agricultural Complex (MSAC) is a 600-acre experimental farm in south-central Louisiana, in the very southern reaches of the United States, approximately 40 km north of the Gulf of Mexico. The MSAC consists of many land uses and facilities, including a dairy, crawfish center, beef herd, sugarcane crop, and equestrian center, as well as numerous features and programs for research, education, and residence. The mission of the MSAC, which is operated by the Department of Renewable Resources at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, has been to accommodate research and education in production agriculture, while generating revenues through the delivery of food products into the local economy. In recent years, environmental conservation has been increasingly important at the MSAC. Best management practices (BMPs) were implemented to reduce soil loss and mitigate nonpoint source pollution. Research was initiated to quantify the effectiveness of these BMPs, and workshops were conducted to explain preliminary results to local farmers. However, environmental improvements at the MSAC had until 2000 been piecemeal, which may be said as well for agriculture overall. What is needed is a comprehensive integrated approach to analyzing and improving environmental performance, as is possible when implementing an environmental management system (EMS). This manuscript describes our efforts to integrate piecemeal environmental improvements into a farm-wide program of systematic improvement. This process began with a qualitative ranking of the MSAC's inputs and outputs, followed by a quantification of certain key parameters related to the consumption of resources and provision of services at the Complex. Certain measures related to the Complex's eco-efficiency were combined into a ratio that provides a useful target for management and continuous improvement. Eco-efficiency, which is defined as 'the efficiency with which receivables are converted into deliverables', is a good way to apply the lessons of industry to the agricultural sector, for instance, by monitoring and managing resource efficiency as an aspect in an EMS such as prescribed by ISO 14000. This will require disciplined recordkeeping and managed conservation, and will promote long-term environmental improvement. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID GROWTH
AB Public participation as a means of identifying sustainability indicators for Chongming County, Shanghai, China was evaluated by an international group drawing on established best practice. An initial 'long list' of 86 sustainability indicators, based on previous indicator systems developed in China, was identified. This 'long list' was reduced via consultations with local academics and local-government officers from Shanghai City and Chongming County to a 'short list' of 17 indicators. This short-list was subjected to further community consultation involving 159 local-government officers, teachers, students (aged 12-14 years), farmers and workers. Data from the consultations indicated differences in the understanding of sustainable development among the different sectors. By combining the data from the different sectors it was possible to identify a consensus around 4 core and 7 additional indicators. These are proposed as indicators which could be used to steer local activities directed towards sustainable development. The list of indicators produced by the people of Chongming Island was compared to local indicator systems in Europe. In comparison with European lists the Chongming list was found to have a greater emphasis on economic development but a similar level of concern for environmental matters. This study has special significance as it reports on the implementation of a process involving local resident participation in the process of sustainable development in China.

DE watershed; landscape; water resources; eco-environment
AB A scheme for watershed protection and landscape enhancement( WPLE) by utilization of river water was proposed to renovate water resources and protect ecological environment in Qiongshan City, Hainan Province, China. Utilization of river water may diminish the drought and flood risks. The scheme is beneficial to solve the problems of water resources shortage, groundwater declines and saltwater intrusion in the watershed. The object of the WPLE scheme is to achieve a sustainable integrated development of environment, ecology, economy and society. A kind of physically beautiful and functionally vivid landscape may exert its synthetical function on the diversity of landscape and the enjoyment of inhabitants. Feasibility of the scheme will be demonstrated by more experiments and tests, as well as observations in a long term.

DT Article
DE indices; emergy; sustainable development
AB The emergy indices for the evaluation of system's sustainable development ability were studied. Results indicated that the emergy indices are simplified and merged, and a new emergy index for sustainable development( EISD) is deduced. Employing EISD, two cases are conducted. The first one is to compare three different dike-pond agro-ecological engineering modes, which are: melon-melon-cabbage-four domestic fishes ( mode I), melon-melon-cabbage-pig-four domestic fishes ( mode II) and melon- melon-cabbage- pig-four domestic fishes combined with Siniperca chuatsi B. ( mode III). The result is that the EISD of mode I is 0.53. Mode II ' s EISD is 5.26 times of mode I, and mode III's EISD is 6.83 times of mode I. The second one is to evaluate the development of Zhongshan City, Pearl Delta, during 1996 to 2000. The result indicated that the EISD of Zhongshan had appreciably declined from 1996 to 1998, and quickly improved from 1998 to 2000, partly because of its environment protection and product construction. Both of the two cases studies showed that EISD can assessment the sustainable development ability more roundly, with the consideration of environmental impact and social-economic effect at the same time.

AB As defined here, sustainable forestry ensures each ecosystem provides its fair share of values, neither overly depriving itself or other times and places of the ability to provide values. This "working" definition builds on other efforts to examine sustainability and uses the Montreal Process criteria as values to be sustained. It is first important to ensure that each "potential forest ecosystem" contains enough "intact forests" to provide the values, followed by ensuring each forest provides the values through a combination of reserves and active management. Economic development, less-consumptive lifestyles, a better rural infrastructure, more wood product use, and other factors can be helpful at the proper times and places.

DE international forestry; policy; poverty; sustainable forestry
AB Community forestry holds great potential to improve the situation of poor people through provision of basic forest products. However, Nepal's traditional caste and wealth structures can lead to forest management that does not meet the needs of poor people. Locally created criteria and indicators of success offer an opportunity to incorporate values of status equality into community visions for the future. In this study,we identify similarities and differences between the goals of rich and poor users to determine the aspects of community forestry that require special attention during creation of criteria and indicators.

AB South Africa, the largest industrial roundwood producer in Africa, is a water-scarce country. To ensure adequate water for all South Africans, the post-apartheid government has made a radical shift in water policy, under which timber plantations are now categorized as streamflow reduction activities requiring licenses and incurring water charges. At present the water charges are low and not directly affecting operations, but the new policy raises questions about water use efficiency of forestry land uses, particularly plantation forestry.

AB Metabolic engineering of plants allows the possibility of using crops for the synthesis of novel polymers having useful material properties. Strong and flexible protein-based polymers, which are based on the structure of silk and elastin have been synthesized in transgenic plants. A wide range of polyhydroxyalkanoates having properties ranging from stiff plastics to soft elastomers and glues have been synthesized in various compartments of plants, such as the cytoplasm, plastid and peroxisome. These plant biomaterials could replace, in part, the synthetic plastics, fibers and elastomers produced from petroleum, thus offering the advantage of renewability, sustainability and biodegradability.

AB In 1997, International Lead Zinc Research Organization Inc. (ILZRO), Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), and the Ministry of Energy and Mines (MEM) of Peru signed a Memorandum of Understanding to facilitate the installation of hybrid remote area power supply (RAPS) systems in the Amazon region of Peru. Many remote villages in this vast region have either no or limited electricity supplied by diesel generators running a few hours per day. Subsequently, ILZRO sponsored the engineering design of the hybrid RAPS system and SEIA supported a socio-economic study to determine the sustainability of such systems and the locations for pilot installations. In mid-1998, the Peruvian government approved the design of the system. ILZRO then began efforts to obtain governmental and inter-governmental funding to supplement its own funds to underwrite the cost of manufacture and installation of the systems in two villages in the Amazon region. Additional major funding has been received from the Global Environmental Facility (GEF) administered by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and from the Common Fund for Commodities (CFC). Funds have also been received from the US Department of Energy, the International Greenhouse Partnership (Australia) and the Peruvian government.
   The RAPS system consists of modules designed to provide 150 kW h per day of utility grade ac electricity over a 24 h period. Each module contains a diesel generator, battery bank using heavy-duty 2 V VRLA GEL batteries, a battery charger, a photovoltaic array and an ac/dc inverter. The batteries and electrical components are housed in modified shipping containers. The modules can be installed with a new generator or retrofitted to an existing generator. The charging and discharging regime of the batteries has been recommended by a study carried out by CSIRO, which has simulated the RAPS operation. The system will employ a partial-state-of-charge (PSOC) regime in order to optimize the life of the batteries, which have a projected life of 8-10 years. A remote monitoring system will consist of a satellite link between each of the remote area power systems and one or more central hosts. The system operator will be able to obtain actual operational status of the system and will be able to change set points and to force operation of certain functions in order to test the system.
   Preliminary cost analyses indicate that such RAPS systems are more economically attractive to provide electricity to remote villages than other alternatives, including 24 h diesel generation and grid extension.
   The past 5 years have provided a number of lessons learned, particularly related to dealing with government agencies in a developing country, overcoming logistical problems such as shipping long distances and dealing with difficult climate and terrain. Despite difficulties encountered, the promise of RAPS systems as a rapidly growing market for lead-acid batteries appears to be bright given the demand for sustainable remote electrification.

AB The sustainability and resilience of an Asian typical steppe grazing ecosystem was assessed by determining thresholds and stable states with an ecosystem simulation model. This analysis used the Savanna model to simulate spatial climate, vegetation, and livestock grazing dynamics, at 14 different stocking rates (5.5-59.8 AUY km(-2)). Grazing effects on vegetation were assessed, including effects on primary production, vegetation composition, and root biomass. Simulations were run for 100 years: 50 years to examine sustainability and 50 years to examine resilience of the system. Results showed that a grazing intensity (1-g/u; g = biomass in grazed area, u = biomass in ungrazed area) of 0.49 was sustainable for this particular system. This region was resilient to grazing up to the intensity of 0.49, where the system remained dominated by herbaceous production. Grazing intensities higher than 0.49, in combination with low precipitation events, resulted in decreased herbaceous net primary production and root biomass, and increased shrub net primary production and root biomass. Herbaceous vegetation was unable to gain a competitive advantage over shrubs in areas where grazing intensities were above 0.49; consequently, the system shifted to a stable shrub-dominated state that could not return its original composition even without further grazing.

TI Social exclusion and transport in the UK: A role for virtual
   accessibility in the alleviation of mobility-related social exclusion?
SO JOURNAL OF SOCIAL POLICY
LA English
DT Article
ID TRAVEL; TELECOMMUNICATIONS
AB This paper reports findings from research into the possibility that mobility-related social exclusion could be affected by an increase in access to virtual mobility - access to opportunities, services and social networks, via the Internet - amongst populations that experience exclusion. Transport is starting to be recognised as a key component of social policy, particularly in light of a number of recent studies, which have highlighted the link between transport and social exclusion, suggesting that low access to mobility can reduce the opportunity to participate in society - a finding with which this research concurs. Following the identification of this causal link, the majority of studies suggest that an increase in access to adequate physical mobility can provide a viable solution to mobility-related aspects of social exclusion. This paper questions the likelihood that increased physical mobility can, by itself, provide a fully viable or sustainable solution to mobility-related aspects of social exclusion. Findings from both a desk study and public consultation suggest that virtual mobility is already fulfilling an accessibility role, both substituting for and supplementing physical mobility, working to alleviate some aspects of mobility-related social exclusion in some sectors of society. The paper incorporates an analysis of the barriers to and problems with an increase in virtual mobility in society, and concludes that virtual mobility could be a valuable tool in both social and transport policy.

TI Why the two won't tango! Explaining the lack of integrated policies for
   sport and tourism in the UK
SO JOURNAL OF SPORT MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB The findings of a 4-year research project that examined the potential for greater integration of sport and tourism policy in the UK are reported. The study is based on in-depth interviews and consultations with various agencies and identifies a number of tensions that exist within the sport-tourism policy process. An analysis of such tensions is used to review the five influences on sport-tourism policy proposed by Weed and Bull (1998). Six influences are now suggested: ideology, definitions, regional contexts, government policy, organizational culture and structure, and individuals. Using these revised influences, an assessment is made of the potential for a sustainable sport-tourism policy network in the UK. It is argued that such a network is not sustainable at the national level but may be possible at the regional level. The author suggests a need to empirically validate the international relevance of the concepts discussed utilizing Weed's (2001) model.

SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION
LA English
DT Article
AB The authors implemented an electronic medical record system in a rural Kenyan health center. Visit data are recorded on a paper encounter form, eliminating duplicate documentation in multiple clinic logbooks. Data are entered into an MS-Access database supported by redundant power systems. The system was initiated in February 2001, and 10,000 visit records were entered for 6,190 patients in six months. The authors present a summary of the clinics visited, diagnoses made, drugs prescribed, and tests performed. After system implementation, patient visits were 22% shorter. They spent 58% less time with providers (p < 0.001) and 38% less time waiting (p = 0.06). Clinic personnel spent 50% less time interacting with patients, two thirds less time interacting with each other, and more time in personal activities. This simple electronic medical record system has bridged the "digital divide." Financial and technical sustainability by Kenyans will be key to its future use and development.

DE urban transportation; public transportation; automobiles; population

AB An analysis of data of the past few decades from cities around the world indicates that history is repeating itself. Although there are significant differences in socioeconomic and technological characteristics among these cities, a remarkable similarity exists in trends in urban transportation. The current growth in the use of automobiles in many cities of developing countries follows similar trends experienced in the United States and other developed countries several decades earlier. Even though there is much awareness and knowledge about sustainability, private vehicle ownership, and use continue to grow at an increasing pace with rising personal incomes and desires to experience faster and more reliable transportation technology. Urban density, expressed in number of people and/or jobs per unit of land, is the key indicator of the level of automobile ownership and use, and of associated parameters of sustainability. As personal incomes rise, choice of residential and job location increases, causing a decrease in urban density and affecting the relative use of private transportation and public transit. There are policy options related to land use, pricing, and technological factors that can have far reaching influence on the long-term sustainability of urban-transportation systems around the world. The basic implication of the analysis is that urban-transportation sustainability can be greatly enhanced if there are profound changes in urban structures and activities that can slow or reverse the growth in the use of private automobiles and can make transit and other modes attractive and viable.

SO JOURNAL OF URBAN ECONOMICS

DT Article
DE social insurance; tax competition; mobility; economic integration
ID POLITICAL-ECONOMY
AB Social insurance schemes differ according to the relationship between contributions and benefits. Bismarckian systems provide earnings-related benefits, while Beveridgean systems offer flat payments. The conventional wisdom is that with factor mobility poor people have incentives to move towards Beveridgean countries. Consequently, Beveridgean regimes would not be sustainable under economic integration. This paper studies the validity of such a conjecture within a simple model. It is shown that mobility does have a significant impact on social protection. However, the equilibrium patterns that can emerge are more complex and diversified than the initial conjecture suggests. In some cases, the equilibrium may even imply that all the poor move to the Bismarckian country. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Rapid technology advances and rapid growth have historically been the basis for the success of the semiconductor industry. Over the last 25 years the industry has enjoyed a growth rate, (similar to15%) which far exceeds the growth rate of the U.S. economy overall (3%-4%). To ensure that this rapid growth rate can be sustained into the future, it is important that the industry makes efficient use of natural resources, minimizes any impact on the environment, and ensures the protection of its workers and the communities in which it operates. It has been repeatedly shown that resource efficiency is linked to lower operating costs and better environmental performance. International SEMATECH's Environment, Safety and Health (ESH) division is engaged in several projects that are aimed at enabling continued, sustainable growth for the industry. These include energy and water conservation, perfluorocompound (PFC) emissions reduction as well as early ESH assessment of the multitude of new chemicals and materials being considered for 157 nm photolithography, low-k dielectrics, and advanced gate stacks. The timely assessment of any potential ESH impacts associated with these materials is essential to ensure that they are used in a safe and environmentally sound manner through cost-efficient ESH solutions and controls. This paper will describe the approach and results of International SEMATECH's efforts, in the areas of resource conservation, PFC emissions reduction, and early identification of potential ESH impacts associated with the next generation semiconductor chemicals and materials.

AB A highly productive sustainable agroforestry system was established on degraded sandy soils in Gaotang County in the northwestern region of Shandong Province. Five pre-existing types of land use were compared. Of these, cropping without forest protection would not be sustainable because of wind erosion, while the benefits from extensive forest stretches are extremely low. Sandy soils in this region could be effectively used by agroforestry systems. The profitability and sustainability of the system depends on proportions and arrangements of trees and crops. The locally developed agroforestry was dramatically improved. In the improved system, tree areas were considerably reduced and intercropping of fruit-tree-crop and crop-crop were increased. The locally developed agroforestry is already ten times more profitable than extensive forest stretches offering minimum shading and root competition, or eight times more than extensive forest stretches offering maximum shading and root competition. Profit from the improved agroforestry is about threefold that of the locally developed agroforestry system. Other sandy regions in China and elsewhere in Asia and Africa could profit from a similar integrated approach, as described here. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB To overcome the limitations of existing aggregated national deforestation models in explaining the impact of changes in agricultural technological on deforestation a two-zone national political economy model is outlined and illustrated by examples from the Philippines and Thailand. It suggests that deforestation trends depend on where and when new technologies are adopted and by whom. In particular, they are sensitive to the balance between adoption in the highly productive Core and the less fertile Periphery where remaining forest concentrates as a country develops. Without parallel adoption in the Periphery, rising yields in the Core alone may not control deforestation. State intervention can help to overcome adoption bias but is still limited by state-elite-corporate links. Five criteria are proposed to assess the likely effectiveness of agricultural policies to control deforestation: (1) improve sustainable farm productivity in the Core, (2) improve sustainable farm productivity in the Periphery, (3) generate sufficient manufacturing/service jobs for ex-farmers, (4) reform land tenure and (5) decentralize state agriculture departments to promote the participation of farmers in the design of appropriate technologies. Deforestation is likely to continue if criteria 1-3 are not met. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB There are policy pressures to make agriculture more environmentally sustainable and to give a more local expression to agri-environmental priorities. This paper considers these moves, with particular reference to the beef sector, and speculates on the further policy responses required to facilitate benign local agri-environmental management. The UK beef sector is characterized by its complexity and diversity but four major systems can be identified operating at varying levels of intensity. Of these, suckler herds and grass-rearing systems have long been associated with high natural value forms of agricultural land management. Many of the cherished habitats and landscapes of the UK are dependent upon grazing for their ecological and amenity value. However a combination of the BSE crisis, the strength of sterling and the recent Foot and Mouth epidemic threatens the sustainability of these high nature value grazing systems. The importance of grazing to 50 selected Sites of Special Scientific Interest is highlighted in the paper. Survey work identified a wide range of systems to be particularly vulnerable to changes in profitability in the beef sector, including: coastal grazing marsh, wet acidic grassland/marshland, upland moor and heath, calcareous grassland and neutral grassland. To maintain these systems requires agricultural policy to be more sensitive to local conditions than currently appears to be the case. There is little policy support for beef farmers in a regional context, still less giving special prominence to those farming within particular biotopes. Nor has there been sufficient policy encouragement to markets for traditional and local beef breeds. The continuing pressure for CAP reform offers further opportunity for policies to be devolved to regions and localities. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents a framework for conceptualising crop-livestock integration along four dimensions: space, time, management and ownership. The framework highlights the fact that benefits from crop-livestock interactions can be gained by integration along one, some or all of these dimensions, although the space dimension is particularly important. The implications of four factors-the 'sustainability imperative'; the human, livestock density relationship; the 'livestock revolution'; and large-scale tsetse clearance-are then explored in relation to the claim that greater crop-livestock integration should be the basis of agricultural development in West Africa. The conclusion of this analysis is that greater crop-livestock integration is likely to be of interest primarily in 'middle' countryside areas with relatively good natural resources.

AB The paper examines various causes that lead a married woman to the state of widowhood. It analyses the problems experienced by some widows of upper caste group in Western Orissa. Data were collected from 206 sample respondents from Sambalpur town with the help of interview, observation and case study methods. The present paper covers five major problems experienced by the widows, namely, finance, children's upbringing, sexual harassment, ill treatment and settling of property rights. The study concludes that as long as the effort to emancipate widow does not come from her family of procreation and the opposite gender, meaningful and sustainable development of widow cannot be realized.

TI Role of traditional knowledge and beliefs in conservation - Case studies
   from Central Himalaya, India
SO MAN IN INDIA
LA English
DT Article
AB The field of environmental studies has been till now concerned mainly with the scientific study of bio-diversity and biophysical exchange while culture and environment remains a relatively new and uncharted territory. Although considerable research work has been undertaken by anthropologists and ecologists, a lot of important information and indigenous knowledge base has already been lost as old people die and their knowledge is not transmitted to younger generations. It is to be noted that ecology is the key to a better understanding of the place that man occupied in nature and of the religious and customary rules that he developed to assist him in his survival. With the disappearance of many traditional customs and the death of those, who enforced them, a lot of extremely valuable information has been/well be lost forever. The present study deals with the traditional beliefs and customs being practiced in the central Himalayas and makes an attempt to bring out the inherent environmental principles behind these practices. Pragmatic approaches combining conservation and sustainable uses are considered, as are traditional values that have conserved the forest and wildlife in the past.

   Straits; Fujian Province
AB The construction of bridges and tunnels plays an important role in the social and economic development of cities and local regions. The planning of the bridge and tunnel across Taiwan Straits will have a positive effect on the economic development at each stage: preplanning, engineering construction, and the completion of the project. The two sides of Taiwan Straits have the advantage of a suitable location, consanguineous relationship, and appropriate geographic conditions. Currently, there are many economic and cultural communications between both sides of the Straits. The bridge and tunnel from Xiamen to Jinmen can be regarded as the beginning of the "golden link belt." The total capability for sustainable development of Fujian Province ranks the sixth among 31 provinces in China, which will provide powerful support for the construction of the bridge and tunnel.

AB Two related topics are addressed in this paper. The first is the challenging and difficult task of producing scientifically credible quantitative assessments of the status, condition or health of coastal marine and estuarine ecosystems on regional to global scales. The second is the current capacity to provide the data required to produce such assessments in a routine and repeatable fashion, a purpose of the Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS). It is concluded that there is an immediate need to develop a coastal module of GOOS that will enable periodic ecosystem assessments and significantly improve the ability of participating nations to achieve the goals of international agreements and conventions for environmental protection, sustainable resources, healthy marine and estuarine ecosystems, and safe and efficient marine operations.

DE marine scientific research; hydrothermal vents; mid-oceanic Ridge;
   International Seabed Area; code of conduct
AB Marine scientific research (MSR), involving the study of hydrothermal vent systems and their associated biological communities, is of some of the most exciting scientific work currently being undertaken. It is generally recognised that the discovery of chemosynthetic-based ecosystems at hydrothermal vents on the deep seabed was one of the most important findings in biological science in the latter half of the 20th century. Hydrothermal vents-underwater water circulatory systems driven by sub-surface volcanic activity-are primarily concentrated along the earth's Mid-oceanic Ridge, a 60,000 kilometre seam of geological activity. Their warm, chemical-laden, waters support some of the planet's most productive and densely populated marine biological communities, despite extreme conditions of high pressure, toxicity and darkness. Though deep sea hydrothermal vents are typically low in biodiversity at the macro-organism level, they tend to exhibit high endemism at taxonomic levels higher than species. In contrast, they host one of the highest levels of microbial diversity on the planet. It is thought that hundreds if not thousands of hydrothermal vent sites may exist along the Mid-oceanic Ridge. But they are extremely hard to find and only approximately 100 sites have been documented by researchers to date. Of these, perhaps only about 12 sites-located within and beyond the limits of national jurisdiction in the International Seabed Area (the Area)-are regularly visited for MSR purposes, primarily because of their proximity to land-based facilities and their relative ease of accessibility. Despite the appearance of physical isolation and their apparent inaccessibility under thousands of metres of water, the more accessible deep sites are potentially threatened by human activities. The activities most likely to involve hydrothermal vents and their biological communities are seabed mining for associated polymetallic sulphide deposits, submarine-based tourism and MSR. Of these, ironically, MSR poses the most immediate threat to the most visited hydrothermal vent systems and their associated biological communities. As a natural resource-based activity MSR needs to be placed on a sustainable footing in order to conserve biodiversity and maintain the scientific value of the most accessible sites. This article will focus on the tools available to place MSR on a more sustainable footing at hydrothermal vents located within and beyond the limits of national jurisdiction. A code of conduct for MSR activities at hydrothermal vents will be proposed. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Although the global community has recognized the importance of environment, gender, and population linkages in the Rio, Cairo, and Beijing action plans during the last decade, there has not been enough collaborative work by integrated coastal management (ICM), gender, and population organizations. The costs of not making these linkages are steep and immediate action is needed. By understanding these linkages and forming new partnerships, coastal managers can improve governance and planning, support more sustainable resource use/management, build capacity for ICM, and attract new funding sources. A proposed action agenda makes recommendations for national governments, civil society, donors, projects/programs, and researchers. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The Integrated Product Policy (IPP), one of the most recent initiatives of the European Commission in the field of sustainable products and services development, considers Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) as natural tool to provide environmental product declarations and verified environmental labels. The need of transparency of environmental performance is getting more importance also in the field of corrosion protection technology. First results of a Life Cycle Assessment on a 'hot-dip zinc galvanising process' for generic steel products are here reported to present a set of environmental sustainability indicators of that industrial sector and to support the preparation of a document with an environmental declaration. The study has been carried out according to ISO 14040 standard and the system referred to an average process resulting from two Italian medium-size plants (about 12.000 metric tons of galvanised steel per year each). Different frameworks such as poles and pylons for energy transportation have been considered from a cradle-to-grave (eco-profile) point of view, adding up to energy and environmental results also on the basis of the steel product service life within different corrosion scenarios.

AB The regions of East and South Asia, and the Pacific Islands are among the most-hazard prone areas in the world. Because of this, during the last century, most of the human casualties of 'natural-triggered' disasters have taken place in this region. This circumstance therefore has become a major global humanitarian concern. Another major concern, specifically for the donor agencies, is the damage sustained by infrastructure resulting from environmental disasters. These recurrent loses take away a significant proportion of the cumulative economic gains accrued from development investments over many years.
   Stepwise multiple regression results substantiated the fact that many of the socio-economic and demographic variables significantly influence disaster-related deaths and injuries in this part of the world. A comparative temporal analysis has shown that, over the past two decades, demographic variables have become prominent predictors of disaster-loss in South, Southeast and East Asian and the Pacific states.
   Many countries of the region are lagging behind in understanding and recognizing the broader scope of disaster mitigation and management. Emerging needs and awareness among the decision-makers and the general public, however, have prompted institutions in many countries to initiate a critical review of the prevailing approaches. The country-specific disaster-management capacities and needs in the region vary widely. There are many differences in historical courses, institutional and administrative settings, sociocultural characteristics, as well as political and economic systems. Development of a common institutional framework for the region, therefore, seems unfeasible. Based upon a regional review, it has become clear that the research calls for improving the understanding of the significance of disaster mitigation and management in light of sustainable development and the emerging global issues. In addition, aspects of human resource development to enhance institutional mitigation and response capacities are emphasized.

AB Two strains of microorganisms that both use sugar as energy resource, but which may choose between two different pathways of ATP production, are studied from a game-theory point of view. We consider these pathways as distinct strategies to which we assign payoffs that are proportional to the expected steady-state number of individuals sustainable on the basis of these strategies. In a certain parameter range, we find that the payoffs fulfil the conditions for the prisoner's dilemma. Therefore, cooperative behaviour is unlikely to occur, unless additional factors intervene. In fact, the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae uses a competitive strategy by fermenting sugars even under aerobic conditions, thus wasting its own resource. The simple quantifiable structure of the model should enable access to an experimentally determined payoff matrix.

AB Since the report of an expert commission in 1975 concerning the situation of psychiatric care in Germany,the public has become aware of the need of reforms. In spite of sustainable improvements in mental health care, there is ongoing skepticism and fundamental criticism about what has been achieved. The following considerations of what constitutes quality in mental health care are directed strictly toward structure quality, which is not sufficient in itself but rather a prerequisite for good treatment and care. As such, structure quality includes health policy and organisational, financial, and human resources as a whole. The concept of need-led care, manifold aspects determining the utilisation of mental health care facilities,and the potential influence of the public on mental health institutions are described and critically discussed. In doing so, it becomes clear that mental health care today is always embedded in superordinate societal values.

AB Accounting for agricultural activities such as P fertilization in regional models of heavy metal accumulation provides suitable sustainable management strategies to reduce nutrient surpluses and metal inputs in agricultural soils. Using the balance model PROTERRA-S, we assessed the phosphorus ( P), cadmium (Cd) and zinc (Zn) flux balances in agricultural soils of a rural region in Switzerland for different farm types and crop types. The P requirements of crops on arable farms were mainly supplied by commercial fertilizers and sewage sludge, while on animal husbandry farms P fertilizer demands were met by animal manure alone. Metal accumulation in soil was very different between the balance units. Estimated net Cd fluxes ranged between 1.0 and 2.3 g ha(-1) yr(-1) for arable farm types, 0.6 and 2.0 g ha(-1) yr(-1) for dairy and mixed farm types, and 9.1 and 17.8 g ha(-1) yr(-1) for animal husbandry farm types. Largest net Zn fluxes of 17.9 - 39.8 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) were estimated for animal husbandry farms, whereas for arable farm types net Zn fluxes of 101 - 260 g ha(-1) yr(-1) and for dairy and mixed farm types of 349 - 3360 g ha(-1) yr(-1) were found. The results indicate that P management is a primary factor determining the variation of these net Cd and net Zn fluxes. The latter were highly sensitive to the Zn/P concentration ratio in animal manure, atmospheric deposition and crop concentrations. Variation of net Cd fluxes resulted mainly from uncertainty in crop concentrations, atmospheric deposition, leaching parameters and uncertainty in Cd/P concentration ratio of commercial fertilizers. In addition, element balances were sensitive to empirical assumptions on fertilization strategy of farmers, such as the partitioning of manure between balance units.

AB This case study investigates the conservation attitudes of two ethnic groups, horticulturalist Pimbwe and agropastoralist Sukuma, living around Katavi National Park (KNP) in western Tanzania, East Africa. Specifically, interest in degazetting KNP was examined (as a reflection of attitude towards the Park) relative to type and extent of KNP outreach, wildlife-related problems, household wealth and residency status. Reported attitudes were then related to fuelwood extraction patterns. Attitudinal surveys showed that a lack of KNP outreach (i.e. village-level services and visits by KNP staff) and increased land wealth and shorter residency time were associated with increased interest in seeing KNP degazetted. However, after controlling for ethnicity only recognition of village-level Park services was still associated with positive attitudes towards KNP. People recognizing KNP services also demonstrated more ecologically sustainable wood extraction methods. These results suggest that while attitudinal studies seem to be a logical step towards making informed decisions about the effectiveness of protected area outreach, relating such outreach to behavioural changes in resource use through attitudinal assessment is a greater challenge, requiring a clear understanding of the relative influence of socioeconomic and cultural factors.

AB The expanding agriculture in the Brazilian savanna, the Cerrado, changes C and nutrient storages of the savanna ecosystems thereby affecting the global C budget and the sustainability of the local land use. We examined the biomass and the C, N, P, and S storages in above- and belowground biomass, in the organic layer, and in the top 2 m of the mineral soil ( Anionic Acrustoxes) of three replicate plots of each of native Cerrado, Pinus caribaea Morelet plantations, productive and degraded Bracchiaria decumbens Stapf. pastures, and of conventional and notillage soybean cultivation. Aboveground biomass - in the cropping systems shortly before harvest - decreased in the order, Pinus (15 kg m(-2)) > Cerrado (2.3) > conventional tillage (1.9) > no tillage (1.5) > productive pasture (0.64) > degraded pasture (0.37) and belowground biomass in the order, Pinus (9.1) > Cerrado (3.0) > productive pasture (2.2) > degraded pasture (1.5) > conventional tillage (0.60) > no tillage (0.41). The aboveground biomass contained 1.1 ( degraded pasture) to 19% ( Pinus) of the total C storage, 0.3 ( productive pasture, degraded pasture) to 3.5% of the total N storage, 0.3 ( degraded pasture) to 2.1% ( no tillage, conventional tillage) of the total P storage, and 0.3 ( degraded pasture) to 3.7% ( Pinus) of the total S storage of the ecosystems. Total C storage in the ecosystems was significantly larger in the Pinus stands (36 kg m(-2)) than in all other systems; differences among Cerrado ( 20), degraded pasture ( 19), productive pasture ( 20), no tillage ( 19), and conventional tillage ( 19) were small and not significant. All land- use systems had larger N ( Pinus, 1.5; degraded pasture, 1.3; productive pasture, 1.4; no tillage, 1.4; conventional tillage, 1.4 kg m(-2)) and S storage (PI, 28; degraded pasture, 33; productive pasture, 34; no tillage, 36; conventional tillage, 38 g m(-2)) than the Cerrado (N, 1.2 kg; S, 26 g m(-2)). The P storages varied between 17 and 29 g m(-2) and were not significantly different among the studied ecosystems. The N and S accumulations in the 12-20-year-old land- use systems were larger than the cumulative known fertilizer inputs indicating that there were unknown inputs possibly including the exploration of the deeper subsoil by deep-reaching roots and transfer of nutrients to the topsoil. Our results indicate that afforestation with Pinus trees has the potential to sequester large amounts of C while pasture degradation, no tillage, and conventional tillage tended to result in small C losses. Land use resulted in a marked accumulation of N and S relative to the Cerrado.

AB Background. This study tests the feasibility of an innovative school-based program for obesity prevention among adolescent girls. New Moves was implemented as a multicomponent, girls-only, high-school physical education class.
   Methods. Six schools were equally randomized into intervention and control conditions. Data were collected at baseline, postintervention, and 8-month follow-up to assess program impact on physical activity, eating patterns, self-perceptions, and body mass index (BMI) among 89 girls in the intervention and 112 girls in the control conditions. Program evaluation also included interviews with school staff, parent surveys, and participant interviews and process evaluation surveys.
   Results. The feasibility of implementing New Moves was high, as indicated by strong satisfaction among participants, parents, and school staff, and by program sustainability. Participants perceived a positive program impact on their physical activity, eating patterns, and self-image. Girls in the intervention significantly progressed in their stage of behavioral change for physical activity from baseline to follow-up. However, for the majority of outcome variables, differences between intervention and control schools at postintervention and follow-up were not statistically significant.
   Conclusions. New Moves was well received and fills a needed niche within school physical education programs. An expanded intervention and evaluation is needed to enhance and assess long-term program effectiveness. (C) 2003 American Health Foundation and Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.

AB The business excellence through resource efficiency (betre) project aimed to increase awareness of the benefits of waste minimisation for SMEs in West Sussex, South East England. The programme was run by the West Sussex Sustainable Business Partnership, a collaboration of all West Sussex Local Authorities, the Environment Agency and EcoSys (a service provider). Betre provided a range of free business support and advice over an 18-month period including; workshops, newsletters, audits, grants and a technical Helpline. Information on environmental compliance and Best Practice for waste minimisation, recycling, energy and water efficiency was disseminated. All activities were linked with the UK government's Best Practice programmes. Although company recruitment was initially slow, betre was ultimately extremely successful at attracting companies to join; with 308 recruited. This is probably the most successful recruitment to a project, of this type, in the UK to date. Over half of the business members became actively involved and attended training events or had environmental audits. There were over 200 improvement actions identified by 64 of the participating companies. These resulted in estimated cost savings of at least pound215000 per annum. In addition, actions taken to prevent pollution and ensure compliance with environmental legislation have the potential to save businesses a further pound204000 in possible penalties. The environmental impact of the project has been significant, with reductions identified in waste (1437 tonnes), water (62933 m(3)) and energy (15 million kW h-equivalent to 668 tonnes CO2). In addition to actions with directly measurable results, betre has stimulated long-term benefits by addressing pollution prevention and compliance, through the formulation of environmental policies and from the adoption of Environmental Management Systems. One of the key learning points is that it may have been better to devote less time to running training events and instead to have diverted this time to increased business support, mainly through audits. To capitalise on this success, a new project is being planned to disseminate Best Practice. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

ID UNEMPLOYMENT; INDICATORS
AB A model is presented for evaluating waste management systems for their contribution to a sustainable development, including environmental, economic and social aspects. The model was tested in a case-study, where groups of long-term unemployed people were offered both education on environmental issues and practical work with the recovery and recycling of building and demolition waste as a form of vocational development. Application of the suggested model revealed the overall effects on sustainability of different methods of waste management. In addition, negative aspects of the systems analysed were identified, which led to discussions about possible improved practices within the waste management systems. Two of the waste management systems investigated (the recycling of steel and re-use of sanitary porcelain) showed a potential contribution to sustainable development in all of the aspects studied. Preparing bricks for re-use showed the largest potential for eco-efficiency, but had negative effects on sustainability from the social perspective of health and the working environment. The possibility of further use of the model and the remaining obstacles to such analyses are discussed. One observation is that the data collection needed to perform this kind of sustainability analysis is resource-demanding, and that it would therefore be better to identify a smaller number of key indicators.

AB A core challenge facing science educators is how to develop and support the implementation of project-based, technology-rich science curriculum that is consistent with international calls for a "new approach" to science education while at the same time meeting the everyday needs of classroom teachers. In this article, we discuss the challenges of scaling out university-developed, project-based curricula, providing a contextualizing frame for the articles that constitute this current issue of Science Education. Specifically, we overview (1) what constitutes and why implement inquiry-based, project-focused learning environments, (2) the role of integrating technology to support their implementation, (3) the value of engaging in design experiments for their development, (4) the importance of allowing for local adaptation, and (5) the process of curricular diffusion. In our thinking, the process of dissemination is not simply "rubber-stainping" the same program into multiple contexts; rather, the process of large-scale adoption involves additional, individual teacher-directed design, fitting, and adaptation for local circumstances.

AB Scaling research-based curriculum to the multitude of science teaching standards and contexts has proven difficult in the past. To respond to the challenge, the Web-based Inquiry Science Environment (WISE) offers designers a technology-enhanced, research-based, flexibly adaptive learning environment. The learning environment can incorporate new features such as modeling tools or hand-held devices. Using WISE, design teams can create projects that bend but do not break when customized to support new school contexts and state standards. WISE curriculum projects are created by diverse design teams that include classroom teachers, technologists, discipline experts, pedagogy researchers, and curriculum designers. WISE inquiry projects incorporate Internet materials and build on the commitments and talents of teachers as well as the constraints and opportunities of their classroom contexts rather than imposing new practices without concern for past successes. These design teams create projects that incorporate diverse features of the WISE learning environment to form specific patterns that are then combined into whole projects. We refer to the whole projects as implementing curriculum design patterns for student activities. The projects are tested to determine how the curriculum design patterns promote knowledge integration, then reviewed by WISE researchers and revised accordingly (see M. C. Linn, P. Bell, & E. A. Davis, in press, Internet Environments for Science Education). Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum.). The most successful projects become part of the WISE library. This paper describes WISE design team practices, features of the WISE leaming environment, and patterns of feature use in current library projects. The success of WISE in classrooms illustrates how flexibly adaptive projects can meet the needs of diverse teachers. Variation amongst library projects shows that designers can support inquiry with a wide variety of activities. Taken together, the library of projects and the success of students learning from them suggest that sustainable curricular innovations. require extensive opportunities for customization and flexibly adaptive designs.

AB Widespread concern over the state of the environment and the impacts of anthropogenic activities on ecosystem services and functions has highlighted the need for high-quality, long-term datasets for detecting and understanding environmental change. In July 2001, an international conference reviewed progress in the field of long-term ecosystem research and monitoring (LTERM). Examples are given which demonstrate the need for long-term environmental monitoring and research, for palaeoecological reconstructions of past environments and for applied use of historical records that inform us of past environmental conditions. LTERM approaches are needed to provide measures of baseline conditions and for informing decisions on ecosystem management and environmental policy formulation. They are also valuable in aiding the understanding of the processes of environmental change, including the integrated effects of natural and anthropogenic drivers and pressures, recovery from stress and resilience of species, populations, communities and ecosystems. The authors argue that, in order to realise the full potential of LTERM approaches, progress must be made in four key areas: (i) increase the number, variety and scope of LTERM activities to help define the operational range of ecosystems; (ii) greater integration of research, monitoring, modelling, palaeoecological reconstruction and remote sensing to create a broad-scale early warning system of environmental change; (iii) development of inter-disciplinary approaches which draw upon social and environmental science expertise to understand the factors determining the vulnerability and resilience of the nature-society system to change; and (iv) more and better use of LTERM data and information to inform the public and policymakers and to provide guidance on sustainable development.

   RESPONSES; LOCHS
AB Over the past 30 years upland streams and lochs in Scotland have shown significant signs of recovery from acidification, particularly in terms of declining concentrations of non-marine sulphate (nm-SO4). Long-term index sites in central and southwest Scotland reveal a significant decline in the concentration of biologically important components, notably acidity (H+) and labile (toxic) forms of aluminium (Al-L), whilst dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and complexed forms of aluminium (AL-NL) have increased significantly. Although these improvements should increase the probability of brown trout survival, and have resulted in increased acid neutralising capacity (ANC) in fishless streams to values close to current critical limits, there is still a relatively poor correlation between ANC and current fish status. Site to site variability appears to be linked to the relative contribution of (H+), Al-L and DOC within the critical ANC (ANC(CRIT)) range. It is proposed that ANCCRIT should cover a range of ANC values as a function. of Al-L concentration. Based on field studies an empirical range of critical ANC values are suggested which better predict the presence of a sustainable brown trout population. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

DT Article
DE vaccination; information; learning; trust; India
AB For US $17 a child can be immunized against six major illnesses. Even at this price, a country such as India would have to spend half its health budget on providing vaccinations. Given the wide variation in immunization costs it may be possible to decrease this cost to more sustainable levels, but to do so we need to arrive at a more thorough understanding of factors affecting household demand for vaccination. Using data on vaccination and pre-natal care collected by the authors in the Garhwal region of India, we explore one aspect of the demand for vaccination in some detail. We show that informational constraints play an important role in the household decision to seek vaccination, and moreover, that learning about the efficacy of vaccinations only through empirical observation may be hard even in environments with variation in vaccination and the high incidence of vaccine-preventable diseases. We argue that when learning about vaccination is inefficient, households use concurrent interventions with easily observable outcomes to evaluate the veracity of a provider's claim regarding preventive care. Hence, the success of immunization programs becomes crucially linked to the success of parallel programs by the same provider. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

DE orphans; kinship; Kenya; LUO; demographic change; community-based
   interventions
AB The HIV/AIDS epidemic has given rise to major demographic changes including an alarming number of orphans in sub-Saharan Africa. The study describes a rural community in western Kenya in which one out of three children below 18 years of age had lost at least one biological parent-and one out of nine had lost both. The main problems these children faced were lack of school fees, food and access to medical care. The high number of orphans has overwhelmed the traditional mechanisms for orphan care, which were based on patrilineal kinship ties. Thus, 28% of the orphans were looked after by culturally "inappropriate" categories such as matrilineal kin or strangers. Furthermore, many of the caretakers were themselves not capable due to ill health or old age. Factors such as poverty, negative attitudes, and traditional funeral customs made the orphans' situation even worse. The authors conclude that though community-based interventions are urgently needed as the most appropriate way to address the issue, the complex, local reality in which cultural factors, kinship ties, and poverty are interwoven needs to be taken into consideration if sustainable solutions are to be found.

AB Recent policy statements on the future directions for agriculture have expressed the importance of the alternative food economy in promoting rural sustainability and improving public health. This paper suggests that these aims can prove incompatible. Alternative constructions of health and safety are likely to resist official discourses of healthy eating as a result of 'lay immunologies' and different cultures of nature. A Ministry of Agriculture consultation exercise on the consumption of unpasteurised milk is analysed to show how people living in rural areas situate health in particular versions of nature to cure and immunise the body from illness. These lay immunologies reconfigure the boundaries of purity/impurity by emphasising the importance of nature, bacteria, dirt and rawness in promoting health. This view is also deeply embedded in notions of rural identity and 'defensive localism'. Scientific recommendations to purify foods are therefore resisted as an erosion of rural identity.

AB In the Brazilian savanna, there is a risk that soil fertility of pastures declines to a level below that of the native savanna because of low fertilizer application. To evaluate biophysical pasture sustainability we compared regularly fertilized productive pasture (PP), degraded pasture fertilized 13 yr previously (DP), and native savanna (Cerrado, CE) in an on-farm experiment. We determined (i) biomass productivity of the pastures and (ii) nutrient concentrations in Anionic Acrustoxes from three plots under each of CE, DP, and PP. From the 0- to 2-m soil layer, we sampled solid phase in January 1998 and soil solution during two rainy seasons (1997-1998 and 1998-1999). The mean aboveground biomass production (dry weight) was 2.1 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) for DP and 4.1 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) for PP. In the solid phase of the 0- to 0.15-m layer, mean total N and S and exchangeable Ca and Mg concentrations increased in the order CE < DP < PP, while NaHCO(3)-extractable P was not significantly different among CE, DP, and PP. In the soil solution at 0.15-m depth, pH and concentrations of Ca and Mg also increased in the order CE < DP < PP. At the 2-m depth, only K, Mn, and NO(3)-N concentrations in soil solution were slightly higher under the pastures than under CE indicating an increased risk of leaching losses to below the rooting zone. Thus, topsoil fertility in both pastures is increased compared with CE, and little leaching occurs. Some fertility indicators in DP are still improved compared with CE 13 yr after a single fertilization.

AB Roots modify the environment in which they grow and can be tactically used to condition the soil for the benefit of following generations of plants. In this study, we evaluated changes in selected nutritional and biological properties of the soil after growing a range of plant types as treatments that modified soil structure through creation of biopores. The plant types were: (i) 6 years of a mixture of Australian native woody species grown in belts followed by I year of cereal crop (belt-soil); (ii) rotation of annual crops (cropping-soil); (iii) a permanent pasture (pasture-soil). Although the number of biopores found in the A-horizon was similar for the belt-soil and cropping-soil, the former had larger air-filled porosity. Differences in fertility indices of the A-horizon amongst the treatments were, however, not associated with those in structure, but were linked to conservation of organic matter. The short phase of woody perennials restored both total C and total N in the top 0.1 m of the soil profile to 93% that found under a 25-years-old permanent pasture, without the fall in pH found in the latter. Increases in total C were primarily associated with high input of organic matter in the belt-soil where the organic matter was also protected from possible losses by oxidation and physical removal due to absence of tillage for 6 years. There was no evidence that the woody species enhanced cation cycling between the topsoil and subsoil, because exchangeable Ca was similar in the A-horizon of the belt-soil and cropping-soil, although this cation was lower in the B-horizon of the belt-soil. The 6 years phase of native woody species reduced inoculum level of root pathogen Rhizoctonia solani Kuhn. Compared to the bulk soil, the area bordering the biopores (biopore-sheath) in the belt-soil was richer in nutrients (total C and total N) and so supported a larger microbial population, which was dominated by cellulolytic fungi. This study showed the potential for short phases of woody perennials in soil management and the attraction for their incorporation in designing new cropping systems for sustainability.

AB Intensive maize (Zea mays L.) cropping based on conventional tillage practices has resulted in soil quality degradation in the Patzcuaro Watershed in central Mexico. A field experiment with seven soil management treatments was implemented on a sandy loam Andisol to evaluate the impact on soil quality of maize cropping with conventional tillage, no-tillage with varying percentages of surface residue coverage (0, 33, 66 and 100%), and no-tillage with 33% residue coverage together with cover crops of either Vicia sp. or Phaseolus vulgaris L. The treatments of no-tillage under crop residue coverage were established in 1995 and the leguminous species were planted in 1998. By 2000, the alternative management treatments had increased soil enzymes, soil organic C, biodegradable C fractions such as water soluble C, water soluble carbohydrates, and microbial biomass C, and soil wet aggregate stability, compared to the CT treatment. Wet aggregate stability was increased by adopting no-tillage and even further by additional residue. Most soil quality characteristics improved in direct proportion to residue inputs. The use of no-tillage management together with a moderate amount of crop residue (33%) and planted to leguminous species rapidly improved some soil quality characteristics. We conclude that conservation tillage practices can provide an alternative technology contributing to sustainable agriculture in the Patzcuaro watershed of Mexico, which can be extrapolated to similar areas elsewhere in Latin America.

   Plateau of China

AB In the dryland region of the Loess Plateau in China, improved soil and water conservation practices are essential for sustainable agriculture. The prevailing cropping practice in this region, growing winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) as a monoculture, carries two major drawbacks which arise during the fallow period from July to September: firstly, an exposure to soil erosion from rainstorms and, secondly, poor water storage efficiency of rain. Alternative cropping systems were therefore investigated. They comprised four rotations, each of 3 or 4 years, involving different combinations of corn (Zea mays L.), wheat, broomcorn millet (Panicum miliaceum), and pea (Pisum sativum L.). The water use efficiencies (WUEs) and sustainability of the rotations were evaluated at Changwu Agri-ecological Station in the Loess Plateau from 1984 to 1996. Results showed that two of the rotations gave significantly improved grain yields and WUE compared to the standard wheat monoculture. The rotation of corn, wheat, and wheat-millet could increase the duration of crop coverage during the rainy season from a low of 38% of the time for wheat to a maximum of 80%, and the crop precipitation interception index (CPII) from 53% for wheat to a maximum of 73%. All the alternative rotations tested did not significantly affect available soil water at wheat planting. Considering all factors, a 3-year rotation of corn, wheat, and wheat-millet was found to offer the best potential for improving cropping practice in the region. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

TI Beyond stakeholder satisfaction: aiming for a new frontier of
   sustainable stakeholder trust
SO TOTAL QUALITY MANAGEMENT & BUSINESS EXCELLENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB We live in a period in which management's efforts to satisfy an organization's stakeholders, i.e. customers, employees, shareholders, etc may not be enough for survival or to achieve high performance in the long run. Despite worldwide recognition for excellence, as defined by the markets and/or models for assessing business excellence, several organizations today suffer from the lack of trust and what future revelations will bring. There have been simply too many instances of well-known companies, even as widely rewarded and innovative as Xerox, that could not enjoy the unquestionable support of their stakeholders, because something critical was missing, and that was their previously taken for granted trust. In this paper we examine ways that an organization can achieve the level of trust needed for sustainable excellence. The proposed approach involves the simultaneous improvement of exploring the space of navigating the future and setting a vision and supporting strategic goals, the building of sound relationships among participants in their realization, and the effective relative to goals (and efficient relative to resource utilization) execution of plans in each period. The common denominator in each type of improvement is the development of skills for effective conversations among those within the organization as well as outside stakeholders. The aim for all types of conversation is to go beyond the satisfaction of stakeholders by meeting their needs and expectations-as this goal is limited to specific transactions or time periods. The new challenge for organizations is to reach a new frontier associated with the development of trust among its stakeholders, which makes it possible to endure the hard times, and continually to explore, with success, emerging opportunities.

AB The transformation of dry lands into irrigated fields using groundwater resources has been the key to agricultural development in a large number of countries. Particularly in arid and semiarid areas, this transformation needs to take into account the limited water resources available.
   It is therefore, necessary to increase water application efficiency by modernising irrigation systems as well as continuously monitoring the irrigated areas in order to regulate the volume of irrigation water used.
   In this paper, we present tools based on Irrigation Advisory Service (IAS) and remotely sensed data combined with geographic information systems (GIS) which assist in this kind of monitoring, especially for large areas.
   The identification of crops in areas with small fields requires high spatial resolution satellite images. The classification criterion is based on the different temporal evolution of different crops. The crop development is described by means of the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI). Crops belonging to the same class are assumed to have similar water requirements.
   We define a new concept, the hydrological management unit (HMU) which includes all the fields which use water jointly. Their spatial location is obtained from the digital rural cadaster (DRC), a vectorial map which delimits each field. The Irrigation Advisory Service of the area determines the water requirements of each crop and estimates the volume of irrigation water actually used. By introducing this information into a GIS, we can quantify the spatial and temporal distribution of water extractions. The regulation of these extractions is the key to sustainability in aquifer case studies. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V All rights reserved.

AB Site selection is a key factor in any aquaculture operation, affecting both success and sustainability. The correct choice of site in any aquatic farming operation is vitally important since it can greatly influence economic viability by determining capital outlay, and, by affecting running costs, rates of productions and mortality factors. It is impractical to try control water quality parameters in cage culture systems, therefore culture of any species must be established in geographical regions having adequate water quality and exchange. This study used GIs and related technology to build a spatial database using those water quality variables which were considered to have an influence in developing marine fish-cage culture of seabass and seabream. in Tenerife (Canary Islands). The water quality variables identified were: temperature, turbidity (runoff soil erosion and sewage), disease stress (sewage) and possibility of waste feedback from fish-cages (bathymetry). Variables were grouped in a logical model and combined to generate outputs showing the most suitable areas for siting cage culture. Most areas of the coastline of Tenerife were identified as being suitable or very suitable, and none was identified as totally unsuitable. Sensitivity to parameter changes was tested in order to evaluate the model, by changing one parameter at a time. Values chosen were +/- 5%, 10% and 15%, of the reference situation. This analysis shows that the model was especially sensitive to sea temperature and suspended solids. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Aimed at developing environment-friendly aquatic feeds, a trial on rainbow trout to reduce phosphorus (P) loading is reported. Growth, feed quality performance, whole body P retention and the calculated P loading were compared between triplicate groups of fish reared with a commercial feed and an experimental diet formulated with low level of fish meal (FM, 20%) and low-P ingredients: defatted soybean meal (20%), corn gluten meal (25%) and blood meal (5%). The total P content was 18.1 and 9.9 g/kg, for the commercial and experimental diets, respectively. Fifty fish with an average weight of 1.9 g were allotted in tanks of 60 l and maintained at water temperature ranging between 12 and 20 degreesC. Fish were hand-fed twice a day to apparent satiety for 48 weeks. At the end of the trial, growth was comparable among fish from different treatments, although it was highest for commercial feed. Dietary treatments did not affect final specific growth rate (SGR), thermal-unit growth coefficient (TGC) or feed gain ratio (FCR). P retention levels were found to be significantly higher in the fish fed the experimental diet (35.9%) than those fed the commercial diet (18.5%). Moreover, P loading was much lower for this group than for fish fed the commercial feed (7.8 kg/ton of fish produced versus 17.3 kg/ton), The results indicate that practical low-P loading diets can be developed for rainbow trout through combinations of alternative protein sources. Furthermore, an optimal combination of diverse low-P protein sources could enhance the feed performance to a level comparable to conventional fish meal (FM) based diets.

AB Pond-cypress (Taxodium ascendens Brong.) is a dominant canopy species in depressional wetlands of the south-eastern Coastal Plain. Unsustainable withdrawals from the karst Floridan aquifer system have caused premature decline and death of pond-cypress trees, presumably owing to altered hydroperiods (which alter the flow of water and nutrients in trees). There has been no scientifically based means to determine sustainable yield from this regional aquifer system or to detect early stages of physical/ecological damage associated with groundwater mining and aquifer storage and recovery (ASR, which also can alter natural hydroperiods). In this study, the relationship between visual symptoms (indicators) of stress or premature decline, and spectral reflectance was evaluated using dried, milled branch tips collected from natural stands of mature pond-cypress. Depressional systems evaluated represented four of the six aquifer system subregions where subsurface perturbations from groundwater mining: (i) were presumed not to be occurring (reference wetlands); (ii) may be occurring but are not documented; and (iii) have been confirmed. Sampled trees were assigned to one of three stress classes (1, no/minimal; 2, moderate; 3, severe) based on the visual indicators. Partial least squares-linear discriminant analysis of second derivative spectral transformations in the visible/shortwave near-infrared (NIR) region (400-1100 nm) and the NIR region (1100-2500 nm) was used to evaluate the samples in assigned classes.

AB Improved management of nitrogen (N) in low N soils is critical for increased land productivity and economic sustainability. We report results of a rainfed rotation experiment, conducted in the Northwest Frontier Province (NWFP), Pakistan, during 1995-1999 to evaluate effects of residue retention and fertiliser N on N-2 fixation inputs and yields of a mungbean (Vigna radiata)-wheat (Triticum aestivum) sequence, and a lentil (Lens culinaris)-summer cereal sequence. Mungbean and sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) or maize (Zea inays) were grown in the summers and lentil and wheat in the winters. Immediately after grain harvest, above-ground residues of all crops were either completely removed (-residue), or chopped into 5-20 cm pieces, spread across the plots and incorporated by chisel plough (+residue). Fertiliser N rates were nil or 120 kg N/ha for wheat and nil or 150 kg N/ha for sorghum/maize. The percentage of mungbean N derived from N-2 fixation (%Ndfa) ranged from 47% to almost 100% (mean of 75%). On average, mungbean fixed 112 kg N/ha (+residues) and 74 kg N/ha (-residues), with N balances of +64 kg N/ha (+residues) and +9 kg N/ha (-residues). Lentil %Ndfa ranged from 50 to 87% (mean of 73%). Values for crop N fixed were 42-85 kg N/ha, with a mean of 68 kg N/ha. Average N balances for lentil were +27 kg N/ha (+residues) and +16 kg N/ha (-residues). Grain yields of the ON wheat responded to the previous mungbean (36% increase over the ON sorghum), but showed an even greater response to fertiliser N applied to the previous sorghum (150% increase). Highest yields were recorded for the N-fertilised wheat (average of 2.27 t/ha). Shoot biomass yields of the ON sorghum and maize responded strongly to the previous lentil crop (49% average increase over the ON wheat) and fertiliser N, applied either to the crop itself (140%) or to the previous wheat crop (32%). Residue retention increased shoot biomass yields of both the summer (average of 20%) and winter crops (average of 9%). Grain yield benefits of residues were 13% for mungbean, and 8% for wheat and lentil. Soil organic N and total organic C, labile C and C management index (CMI), were all increased by N inputs, from both fertiliser and N-2 fixation, and by retention of residues We concluded that retention of residues improves the N economy of the cropping system and enhances crop productivity through the additional N and other soil effects. The question of whether farmers who traditionally remove residues for fodder and fuel would change practices and return the residues to the soil will depend to a large extent on the relative profitability of both options.

AB Crop rotation is an important management practice in the production of soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.). For the eastern Great Plains, more information is needed to determine whether current crop rotations are sustainable for soybean production over a long-term period. A field study was conducted in southeastern Kansas from 1979 to 1998 on a Parsons silt loam soil (fine, mixed, thermic, Mollic Albaqualf) to evaluate long-term effects of crop rotation on soybean yield, seed weight, and soil chemical properties. Treatments consisted of three 2-years rotations and one monoculture system: (1) W-S/S (winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-soybean doublecrop)/full-season soybean; (2) W-Fal/S = (winter wheat-summer fallow)/full-season soybean; (3) GS/S = grain sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench)/soybean; (4) S/S = continuous soybean. Full-season soybean yields were compared across all treatments in even-numbered years. On average, crop rotation increased soybean yields 16% compared to monoculture soybean. Full-season soybean yields averaged 1.91 Mg ha(-1) following wheat-double-cropped soybean, 2.09 Mg ha(-1) following wheat-summer fallow, 1.99 Mg ha(-1) following grain sorghum, and 1.68 Mg ha(-1) following soybean. Soybean seed weights were also significantly greater in most years when grown in rotation compared to monoculture soybean. Crop rotation increased total soil C and total soil N concentrations by 25% in the upper soil profile compared to monoculture soybean. Differences in soil values among crop rotations were directly proportional to the total quantity of above-ground crop residues produced. On average, W-S/S, W-Fal/S, and GS/S rotations produced more than 8 Mg ha(-1) of above-ground crop residues for each 2-years cropping cycle compared with only 3 Mg ha(-1) for S/S. In the short-term. benefit of crop rotation was increased soybean yield, which would likely increase soybean profitability. In the long-term, rotations with high residue-producing crops, such as wheat and grain sorghum, significantly increase total soil C and N concentrations over time, which may further improve soil productivity.

AB Due to a variety of past and present land-usages on the aquifer ground surface, appropriate groundwater management should consider anthropogenic activities on the ground surface and the potential of unsaturated zone media to convey water and pollutants to the aquifer. The objective of this paper is to present an approach which generates guidelines and recommendations which can lead to sustainable development. This method assesses the lithological characteristics of the aquifer's vadose zone, indicating potential rechargeability, while weighting factors leading to potential groundwater pollution resulting from some land-use. Recommendations regarding land-use planning and aquifer recharge can then provide a qualitative ecological tool towards sustainable groundwater management. Owing to its location, its critical significance to the country's fresh water supply, and its available field data, Israel's Coastal aquifer is employed here as the study area for implementation of this approach.

AB Cervical screening in Australia is a successful public health initiative.
   Since the introduction of the National Cervical Screening Program in 1991, there has been a significant fall in incidence of and mortality from cervical cancer.
   Laboratory quality procedures are critical to ensuring optimal outcomes.
   Laboratory accreditation procedures are being reviewed in line with recent government recommendations.
   For a sustainable program, cost-containment issues need to be considered; screening interval, management of screen-detected abnormalities, and new technologies are the critical drivers of cost.

AB In 1995, the iron production in China reached 105.29 million t and China's steel industry entered the period of rapid growth. The vast demand for steel products in domestic market has been the driving force for the rapid growth. As compared to 1995, in 2001 China's iron production increased by 43.64 million t, in which the share offered by increase of blast furnaces volume was 18.2 % and the share offered by technological progress was 81.8 %. The ironmaking in China has been facing the challenges in the restructuring of blast furnaces, the reduction of energy consumption and environmental protection for sustainable development.

AB In order to better identify the future trends in processing technology for "Galvanizing of Steel Strip", it is useful to reflect briefly on the paths that have brought us to our current state of the galvanizing art. The drivers for change have been in three main areas, viz the production process, the product offering and also sustainability issues affecting both process and product.
   As we move into the 21st century, the validity of the change agents is discussed, together with the implications for future developments in process technologies, viz improvements to existing technologies, continuation of fundamental studies into the coating processes and finally alternative technologies.

AB The Cardiovascular Risk Identification and Treatment Center was established in 1997, adopting a collaborative-care clinic model for the purpose of improving the management of high-risk patients with dyslipidemia. This was a retrospective analysis of 417 high-risk patients with greater than or equal to1 year of follow-up laboratory data. Analysis included changes in total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), non-HDL, triglycerides, and total cholesterol to HDL ratio; lipoprotein goal achievement; Framingham risk score; liver function; and cardiovascular events. At baseline, 66% of patients had coronary heart disease (CHD) or equivalent risk, 45% were not receiving dyslipidemia therapy, and 29% were on statin monotherapy. After 3 years in the program, 56% were receiving combination therapy, 41% were on monotherapy, and 2% were not on therapy. The 3 most common treatment regimens were statin plus niacin (36%), statin alone (22%), and niacin alone (14%). All lipoproteins improved from baseline (p <0.001). Overall, 62% to 74% of patients reached singular lipid goals and 35% achieved combined lipid goals. Patients with Framingham 10-year CHD risk of >20% were reduced from 6% to <1%. Only 29 patients (7.0%) had a cardiovascular event, including 5 (1.0%) who experienced a myocardial infarction. Aspartate aminotransferase/alanine transferase elevation >3 times normal occurred in 1% of patients. In conclusion, a collaborative-care practice model adopting individualized, aggressive pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatment strategies is highly effective in achieving lipid goals, is sustainable, and is safe. Furthermore, this approach yields reduced projected 10-year CHD risk. A low rate of cardiovascular events was observed. (C) 2003 by Excerptia Medica, Inc.

AB Palmer and Edmond [Earth Planet. Sci. Lett. 92 (1989) 11-26] indicated that thermally plausible oceanic hydrothermal inputs of strontium to the oceans are not sufficient to balance the riverine input. It has recently been suggested that off-axis low-temperature hydrothermal circulation may reconcile this discrepancy [e.g. Butterfield et al., Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta 65 (2001) 4141-4153]. Strontium isotope alteration profiles are compiled for sampled in situ ocean and ophiolite crust to calculate a sustainable cumulative hydrothermal flux to the oceanic strontium budget. High-temperature circulation contributes similar to1.8 x 10(9) mol yr(-1) of basaltic strontium to the oceans. Enhanced hydrothermal systems in arc-related spreading environments (10% of the crust) may increase this to similar to2.3 x 10(9) mol yr(-1). It is shown that low-temperature flow cannot supply the remaining flux required to reconcile the oceanic strontium budget (similar to8.7 x 10(9) mol yr(-1)) because this would require 100% exchange of seawater strontium for basaltic strontium over an 820 m section of MORB-like crust. Currently sampled in situ ocean crust is not altered to this extent. The isotopic alteration intensity of 120 Myr crust sampled in DSDP Holes 417D and 418A indicates that off-axis low-temperature flow may contribute up to similar to8 x 10(9) mol yr(-1) of basaltic strontium (9% of that required). The ocean crust can sustain a total basaltic strontium flux of similar to3.1 +/- 0.8 x 10(9) mol yr(-1) (Sr-87/8(6)Sr similar to0.7025) to the oceans. This is consistent with hydrothermal flux estimates, but remains less than a third of the flux required to balance the oceanic strontium budget. The ocean crust cannot support a higher hydrothermal contribution unless the average ocean crust is significantly more altered than current observation. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB The ecosystem-management model FORECAST was used to compare some ecological impacts of natural disturbance (wildfire) and timber harvesting. The scientific objective of the study was to assess whether or not two types of timber harvesting at various rotation lengths would have biogeochemical and biomass implications that are within the natural range of variation caused by wildfire. The practical objective was to identify management strategies that would sustain or improve long-term site productivity in lodgepole pine forests in the central interior of British Columbia. We defined three fire severity categories (low, medium and high), three fire return intervals (40, 80 and 120 years), two utilization levels (including stem-only harvesting [SOH] and whole-tree harvesting [WTH]), and three timber production rotation lengths (40, 80 and 120 years). Differences in simulated productivity, decomposing litter mass, total available soil nitrogen and nitrogen removals were compared for all 15 combinations of the five levels of disturbance at the three frequencies. The simulated nutritional impacts of timber harvesting were within the simulated range of impacts caused by the wildfire defined in this study. They were similar to the simulated long-interval, low-severity wildfire regimes. Simulations suggest that ecological rotation lengths for long-term site productivity for lodgepole pine forests in the study area would be 80-120 years. These rotation lengths are close to the average wildfire return intervals (100-125 years) in the study area, supporting the idea that the present harvesting strategies should sustain tree growth at this frequency of harvest and severity of harvesting impacts. Both WTH and SOH are acceptable harvesting methods for the maintenance of long-term site productivity in these lodgepole pine forests if harvest intervals are 80 years or longer. However, SOH is a more nutrient conservative harvest method, and should be used instead of WTH for rotations less than 80 years. The importance of initial site quality in assessing sustainable long-term site productivity by modeling is demonstrated. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Generic criteria and indicator (C&I) frameworks have been the focus of recent work on sustainable forest management. These templates, however, may not be an appropriate approach for directing landscape-level forest management strategies. Instead, many argue that sustainable management should be determined using "bottom-up" approaches rather than standardized frameworks. This requires engaging local expertise in defining sustainability. Having a culturally distinct form of local knowledge, Aboriginal communities have an important role to play in decision-making processes. However, conventional participatory approaches, such as generic C&I frameworks and multi-stakeholder planning processes, are often inappropriate for engaging Aboriginal involvement. We suggest that landscape-level forest planning should highlight rather than assimilate cultural perspectives on sustainable forest management. Using the co-managed John Prince Research Forest in central interior British Columbia as a case study, this paper presents the results of using C&I and a scenario planning approach to describe an Aboriginal perspective of good forest stewardship. These results demonstrate that, in contrast with existing C&I frameworks, locally-based sustainability criteria provide better guidance for developing and adapting landscape-level forest plans.

AB Since the early seventies, a considerable part of the Swiss population has perceived the actual development of the landscape as unwelcome and problematic. In spite of the efforts in science and politics this problem could not be reduced effectively. The measures taken concentrated on protecting the landscape. According to our hypothesis a sustainable landscape development does not only require protection, but also and maybe most of all the participation of the local residents in shaping the landscape. So the problem of the landscape is that participation is somehow blocked. This study tried to provide the foundations for a new strategy to a sustainable landscape development by finding answers to the following questions:
   What prevents local residents from participating in the processes that shape their landscape?
   How could they be encouraged to participate?
   These questions were investigated with methods of qualitative social science research (interviews, photo experiments, action research). The investigation was carried out in two rural communities, which differed in their degree of urbanisation.
   We found that the residents' participation was mainly prevented by the persistent identification with the village community, which is connected with a pressure to adapt to collective standards. To foster participation new communicative instruments are needed, which allow to exchange ideas without risking to be ostracised. Such instruments were evaluated in the two communities and proved to be effective. At the same time, it became clear that fostering a participatory landscape development requires a long-term learning-process. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

ID DOMAIN-STRUCTURE; FILM ELEMENTS; SIMULATION
AB We report a finite-element study of magnetic configurations in submicron permalloy disks using micromagnetics principles. Depending on the disk size, many (meta)stable magnetic states such as normal and twisted onion, in-plane vortex, and various buckle states are observed. A diagram is constructed to bring out the dependence of the different remanent states on the disk diameter and thickness. It shows that the disk thickness is the decisive factor in determining whether a vortex state is energetically more favorable than an onion state, and that the disk diameter determines whether some in-plane buckling can be sustainable.

ID CO-EVOLUTIONARY APPROACH; VULNERABILITY
AB This paper describes the development of socio-economic scenarios, in both qualitative and quantitative terms, for use in integrated assessment modelling of the impacts of climate change in 2 contrasting English regions: East Anglia and the North West. The need for socio-economic scenarios is discussed, and the 'mediating' role that they play between intellectual debate and policy deliberation is analysed. Four scenarios are constructed for each region: regional enterprise, global sustainability, regional stewardship and global markets, and we provide the rationale for the socioeconomic and policy changes we propose under each scenario. Spatial mapping of 2 of the scenarios in each region is then conducted for 3 illustrative issues (built development, biodiversity and coastal zone), and a sample of non-spatial agricultural variables is inferred. A major focus of the paper is an examination of the experience of engaging stakeholders in the development of the socio-economic scenarios. We explore, in particular, how stakeholders reconciled a given long-term scenario framework with their shorter-term and particular policy-driven requirements.

AB Energy conservation is now playing a key role in industrial development and is vital for sustainable development. Therefore, it should be implemented by all possible means, despite of its own limitations. This study highlights the current enviromental issues and potential solutions to these issues, identifies the main steps for implementing energy conservation programs and the main barriers to such implementations, and provides assessments for energy conservation potentials for countries, as well as various practical and environmental aspects of energy conservation. It is believed that this paper will be beneficial to energy policy makers particularly for energy conservation programmes. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

DT Article
AB Purpose: To outline the thinking of disabled people about their situation and status before the formulation of the ICIDH (International Classification of Impairment, Disability and Handicap) in 1980, the growth of the international disability rights movement since 1980, its subsequent involvement in the revision process and then its hopes as to the effectiveness of the ICF (the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health - the revised ICIDH) in the future.
   Method: This is a personal analysis based on the author's experience as a disability rights activist and as a member of the World Council of Disabled Peoples' International (DPI), elected in 1987 to represent DPI in the revision process and who later became Chair of the Environmental Task Force.
   Results: These are shown to be a major shift from the medical model of disability to the adoption of the interactive model and the impacts of environmental factors in all aspects of health and functioning.
   Conclusions: That proper use of the environmental factors within the ICF will ensure appropriate policies, systems and services for health care and support, provide measurable indicators for health status and sustainable development and underpin the recognition that disability is a human rights issue.

AB Fire was arguably the most important forest and rangeland disturbance process in the Inland Northwest United States for millennia. Prior to the Lewis and Clark expedition, fire regimes ranged from high severity with return intervals of one to five centuries, to low severity with fire-free periods lasting three decades or less. Indoamerican burning contributed to the fire ecology of grasslands and lower and mid-montane dry forests, especially where ponderosa pine was the dominant overstory species, but the extent of this contribution is difficult to quantify. Two centuries of settlement, exploitation, management, and climate variation have transformed the fire regimes, vegetation and fuel patterns, and overall functionality of these forests. We present a narrative that portrays conditions beginning at the first contact of Euro-American settlers with Indoamericans of the region and extending to the present. Due in part to its geographic isolation, the Inland Northwest was among the last regions to be discovered by Euro-Americans. In 200 years the region has undergone fur trapping and trading, sheep, cattle, and horse grazing, timber harvesting, mining, road construction, native grassland conversion to agricultural production, urban and rural area development, fire prevention, and fire suppression. We highlight key changes to forest landscape patterns and processes that occurred under these combined influences, discuss implications of the changes, and progress towards restoring sustainability. An adaptive ecosystem management model has been adopted by public land management agencies to remedy current conditions. Ecosystem management is a relatively new concept that emphasizes the integrity and sustainability of land systems rather than outputs from the land. Adaptive management emphasizes the twin notions that incomplete knowledge and high degrees of risk and uncertainty about earth and climate systems will always limit land and resource planning and management decisions, and that management is chiefly a learning and adapting process. We discuss current issues and future options associated with ecosystem management, including the low likelihood of social consensus concerning desired outcomes, the lack of integrated planning, analysis, and decision support tools, and mismatches between existing land management planning processes, Congressional appropriations, and complex management and restoration problems.

AB Formation or reactivation of brittle faults and fractures within low-permeability rocks capping regions of overpressured crust creates drainage conduits limiting the degree of overpressuring. Maximum sustainable overpressure is therefore affected by the local state of stress within the capping layer and by any existing architecture of faults and fractures. Reshear of existing cohesionless faults that are favorably oriented for frictional reactivation within the stress field provides the lower limiting bound to overpressures and inhibits development of other brittle structures. Formation of drainage conduits by hydraulic extension fracturing is important only in the case of intact caprock under low differential stress. Brittle-failure-mode plots demonstrate that maximum overpressure is inversely related to the level of differential stress and that high overpressures are easier to sustain in compressional regimes. Changes in the regional stress state in areas of overpressuring (for example, during tectonic inversion) may induce significant fluid redistribution.

AB An easy and reproducible pollen germination method for Argan (Argania spinosa (L.) Skeels) has been established using a combination of three phenological phases (flower bud BF, flower bud with an emerging style BFS and blooming flower FE), two germination media, two incubation temperatures (25 degreesC and 30 degreesC) and 14 genotypes. The number of germinated pollen and the pollen tube growth were observed. Best results were obtained with pollen extracted from FE on a solid 1% agar medium containing 20% sucrose, 200 ppm CaCl2 and 75 ppm H3BO3, at 30 degreesC for a minimum of 20 h, while sustainable tube growth was maintained until the end of the experience. The pollen from BF phase does not germinate at all. The germination of the pollen from BFS, although low, was dependent on the genotype. Thus, emasculation is requested at early BF stages to avoid self-pollination prior to hand pollination. Highly significant differences between tree genotypes was observed for the number of germinated pollen and for tube growth showing a differential male-gametophytes potential fitness that could influence gene flow between trees.

AB Control or eradication of Taenia solium cysticercosis has been achieved to date only in Europe and North America. Significant improvements in sanitary conditions and developing functional slaughterhouse control systems were primarily responsible for control in these regions. Conversely, in endemic areas of developing countries control is limited by economic and sanitary conditions: the life cycle of T solium is sustained because pigs have access to infected faeces, and cysticercosis-infested pork is available for consumption. Interventional trials with massive human cestocidal chemotherapy, treatment of both human and porcine populations with antihelminthic drugs and/or immunotherapy and health education have shown improvements in specific settings but not yet proven to be sustainable in the long-term. In order to ensure sustainability, any given control strategy towards elimination/eradication of porcine cysticercosis should incorporate economic incentives. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

DE pig; swine; husbandry; free-range; tropics
AB To minimise the risk of cysticercosis in pigs it is necessary to raise pigs in confinement. The prevailing production system using free-range pigs is apparently very resilient although economic studies have shown that these traditional production systems are wasteful and unprofitable due to poor feed conversion, high mortality rates, low reproductive rates and poor final products. However, experiences from Africa show that intensive pig farming is stagnant and the sustainability of the traditional sector is better than that of the intensive sector. Examples from various African countries are given on the failure of intensive pig farming. This apparent paradox has various explanations. The lower fixed cost of traditional pig production compared with intensive production is one. Another explanation is that many households have some kind of kitchen waste, which can be exploited by a pig, but there is only enough for the partial feeding of a single pig. A third explanation of the paradox is that the pig has functions that are not reflected in a simple economic balance. The pig is a source of capital income, which can be realised at times of major expenses, and it can also be used as a way to put aside small amounts of money, which alternatively might evaporate. The pig's scavenging behaviour has clear nutritional benefits. Thus, a diet consisting of e.g. maize or sorghum, which are some of the feeds available on the small farms, will only provide approximately 30% of the pigs requirements of lysine and methionine, which are the most limiting amino-acids in pig feeds. Simulations with data available for green feeds and material of animal origin show that a 20% 'supplement' from the fields may increase the amino-acid provision to about 80% of the optimum. If pigs are kept enclosed this supplement has to be fed to the pig which involves purchase and labour costs. The paper discusses the various options in terms of feeding, housing and use of genetic resources for the improvement of pig husbandry in tropical resource-poor countries.

AB Meat is an important source of protein and a valuable commodity in resource-poor communities. In many developing countries, lack of appropriate slaughtering facilities and unsatisfactory slaughtering techniques are causing unnecessary losses of meat as well as invaluable by-products from animal carcasses. Slaughtering places are frequently contaminated and may not be protected against dogs, rodents and insects. Meat products coming from such conditions are often deteriorated due to bacterial infection or contaminated, which may cause food poisoning or diseases in consumers. In many developing countries, regulations concerning meat inspection and/or control are inadequate or non-existent allowing consumers to be exposed to pathogens including zoonotic parasites. In Nepal, buffaloes contribute about 64% of the meat consumed, followed by goat meat (20%), pork (7%), poultry (6%) and mutton (2%). Goat and poultry meat is acceptable to all castes of people while buffalo meat is consumed mainly by the Newar ethnic group. Previously, pork was consumed only by people belonging to low castes, however, in recent years, the consumption of pork has increased in higher castes as the caste system has become more relaxed. Until recently, there were no official meat inspection regulations in the country, however, in 1999, the national government legislated an as-yet-to-be implemented Animal Slaughtering and Meat Inspection Act which mandates slaughterhouse construction and meat inspection and control. Due to the lack of implementation of the Meat Inspection Act and resultant absence of meat inspection, meat from sick or parasite-infected animals is serving as a source of infection to humans as well as other animals. In addition, meat quality is adversely affected by careless handling conditions in the slaughtering places as well as in the meat markets or shops. For improvement in animal slaughtering and meat inspection in both rural and urban areas of Nepal, several strategies are to be recommended. Sustainable capacity building should be introduced including training of veterinarians, meat inspectors and butchers as well as building of slaughter facilities. Government policies on slaughter procedures including ante-mortem examination, meat inspection and stamping of meat should be implemented. Programmes should be instituted with strong focus on prevention and control of meat-borne diseases to reduce infection risk of consumers and meat handlers and to avoid contamination of the environment. Lastly, emphasis should be put on improving the animal husbandry system in Nepal. These same actions can be undertaken in other developing countries to assist with improving meat inspection and control, thus helping with prevention and control of cysticercosis as well as other important meat-borne diseases.

ID POLICY
AB This paper examines the role of cattle production-in, the-evolution of smallholder farming systems in a frontier region of Brazilian Amazonia. There are many incentives for smallholders to raise cattle, but the success of cattle enterprises depends on a number of factors, both endogenous and exogenous to individual farms. A key factor in the intensification of cattle production is pasture management. We identify three models of pasture management, reflecting different levels of specialisation and intensification of production systems. Contrary to conventional wisdom, our-findings indicate that pasture quality and degradation are related to under-utilisation and low stocking rates: This suggests that more-intensive systems may be more ecologically sustainable in some contexts. However sustainable intensification strategies, which could potentially contribute to frontier stabilisation, depend on investment in infra-structure, markets and social capital beyond the capacity of individual farms or farmers.

AB The whole farm model FASSET ver. 1.0 was used for evaluation of the environmental and economic consequences of implementing different nitrogen taxes. The taxation policies analysed were a tax on nitrogen in mineral fertiliser, a tax on nitrogen in mineral fertiliser and imported: animal feedstuff, and a tax on the farm nitrogen surplus. In these scenarios, the tax price was equal to the price of the nitrogen in mineral fertilisers (0.67 E kg N-1). Four farm types were considered: arable on sandy soil, arable on loamy soil, pig production on sandy soil and pig production on loamy soil. Impacts of the taxes for each farm type on crop rotation, fertiliser. use and pig production were estimated by the Linear Programming module of FASSET. The dynamic simulation module of FASSET evaluated the environmental and economic consequences of the new production plans. The social abatement cost of reducing nitrate leaching varied between 1 and 9 E kg N-1. None of the taxation policies was the most cost-effective. for all farm types. Tax on mineral-fertiliser favours-pig producers, whereas the tax on nitrogen surplus favours arable farms. Thus efficient taxation schemes for reduction of nitrate-leaching should differentiate between farm types rather than use uniform input taxes. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Sustainability analysis for irrigation water management in the Aral Sea
   region
SO AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article

ID RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
AB Sustainable irrigation water management should simultaneously achieve two objectives: sustaining irrigated agriculture for food security and preserving the associated natural environment. A stable relationship should be maintained between these two objectives now and in the future, while potential conflicts between these objectives should be mitigated through appropriate irrigation practices. The Aral Sea region in Central Asia is such a region that is. most famous for its conflict between sustaining irrigated agriculture and preserving the environment. The current status of irrigation water management in the Aral Sea region demonstrates the Aral Sea disaster as a prime example for unsustainable irrigation development. This paper presents an integrated modeling framework for sustainable irrigation management analysis and applies it to analyze irrigation water management in the Aral Sea region. Based on the modeling outputs, alternative futures of the irrigation practice in the region are explored and it is found that to maintain current irrigation practices will lead to worsening environmental and economic consequences. Investments in infrastructure improvements (about annualized US $299 million) and crop pattern change will be necessary to sustain the irrigated agriculture and the associated environment in the region. Moreover, a penalty tax on salt discharge less than 50 US$ per ton as an economic incentive may help address environmental problems, while having only a small effect on irrigation profit.

SO AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS

DE sustainable agriculture; low external input agriculture; technology
   adoption
AB Low external-input agricultural technologies are commonly developed for and promoted-in poor rural areas of the developing world because they are presumably more appropriate for farmers who may not have the access or ability to adopt methods requiring significant purchased. inputs. The System of Rice Intensification (SRI), a low external-input (LEI) technology, has received a fair amount of attention in. recent years both in and outside of Madagascar, where remarkable yield increases have been achieved in a country where most farmers are unable to grow enough rice to feed their families. Despite its promise, we find that SRI is-difficult for most farmers to practise because the method requires significant additional labor input at a time of the year when liquidity is low and labor effort is already high. While SRI may be unique for its dramatic yield increases arid relative complexity, the highly seasonal labor intensive nature of SRI is common to many LEI technologies, calling into question the common assumption of the appropriateness of such technologies for smallholders.

   agriculture; US livestock agriculture; vertical integration

AB US livestock agriculture has developed and intensified according to a strict productionist model that emphasizes industrial efficiency. Sustainability problems associated with this model have become increasingly evident and more contested. Traditional approaches to promoting sustainable agriculture have emphasized education and outreach to encourage on-farm adoption of alternative production systems. Such efforts build on an underlying assumption that farmers are empowered to make decisions regarding the organization and management of their operations. However, as vertical coordination in agriculture continues, especially in the animal agriculture sectors, this assumption becomes less valid. This paper examines how the changing industrial structure in four US livestock sectors (poultry, hogs, beef, and dairy) affects possibilities in each for promoting more sustainable production practices. Comparisons between the sectors are based on the relative ability to employ an intensive pasture or alternative (deep-bedded) housing system, which are widely seen as sustainable livestock alternatives. While the highly integrated poultry sector appears impregnable to traditional sustainable agriculture approaches, the cow-calf sub-sector of the beef industry, non-feedlot dairy operations, and small parts of the hog industry, especially in the Midwest, still retain some potential for effectively targeting the farmer. Building on the presentation of barriers and opportunities in the four livestock sectors, the paper concludes by evaluating several structurally-oriented approaches to promoting a more sustainable livestock agriculture that should complement more traditional approaches. They include developing alternative coordinated networks in livestock agriculture, pressing integrators to permit more sustainable production practices, and working for legislation that shifts more decision-making within integrated systems towards growers.

ID EPISTEMOLOGY
AB A conceptual framework influenced by the concept of moral ecology is developed and used to analyze the transition from technological (green revolution) to ecological (organic) rice farming by resource poor farmers from the Philippine island of Bohol. This Moral Ecology Framework (MEF) focuses on the epistemology of the two farming systems and how this influences management principles and practice.. The orienting concepts of systemic understanding, exchange between society and the environment, local versus extra-local exchange and scope are integral to this analysis. The case study demonstrates how the ostracism of nature under the green revolution coupled with its inflexible production options affected the sustainability of some local rice farming systems. Whereas the transition to organic farming and the concomitant incorporation of ecological processes and more flexible production options has allowed local farmers to enhance the sustainability of their farming systems by altering the exchange processes within the socio-ecological system.

AB An evaluation was made of the associations between self-reported health conscious consumerism, body-mass index (BMI), and consumer beliefs, attitudes, intentions, and behaviors regarding sustainably produced foods. Self-administered surveys were completed by adult consumers (n = 550) in three metropolitan Minnesota grocery stores. Selected demographic and psychographic differences between health conscious consumers and non-health conscious consumers were evaluated. Compared to non-health conscious consumers, health conscious consumers were more likely to be female, older, more educated, higher income earners, more active, healthier, and possess a healthier body mass index. They also held more supportive beliefs, attitudes, and intentions with regard to sustainably produced foods. In conclusion, some consumers are interested in supporting sustainable production practices and their support may be linked to improved personal, environmental, and community health.

AB Sustainable agriculture requires an adequate analysis framework. Fuzzy logic-based and field scale indicators were developed to evaluate the effects of pesticides and tillage on agroecosystems. All the assumptions and rules for making inferences reflect the current knowledge and the expert perception and judgment about the potential environmental impact of pesticides and tillage. The proposed indicators require four input variables: (1) number and type of applied pesticides, (2) rate of applied pesticides, (3) number and type of tillage tools, and (4) land capability class of each field. In regards to pesticide impact, the indicators consider the toxicity effects on: (1) mammals and (2) insects, while the tillage impact is evaluated taking into account the effects of different tillage operations on: (1) the retention of crop stubble on the soil surface, and (2) the stability of soil aggregates. Two overall outputs were obtained: (1) pesticide index and (2) tillage index. The developed indicators were used to compare the potential environmental effect of current practices carried out in Inland Pampa (Argentina). Concerning pesticide use, cropping winter wheat did less harm to the agroecosystem than cropping maize and sunflower. The overall values of tillage index were similar within crops. However, large differences in pesticide and tillage effects were found among tillage systems. Soybean showed the highest variability in both indexes. The type of analysis carried out in this study using farm-level variables may help find more sustainable ways to manage agricultural inputs. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Past and present status of runoff harvesting systems in dryland
   peninsular India: A critical review
SO AMBIO
LA English
DT Article
ID ANDHRA-PRADESH; DISTRICT; WATER
AB Many modern agricultural systems are structured around one dominant form of water storage and distribution, usually large reservoirs. In contrast, in peninsular India, small reservoirs (tanks), predominantly supplied by surface runoff as opposed to river canals have for centuries been the trademark of an entire agrarian civilization, with no equivalent elsewhere in the semiarid tropics. This article focuses on the physical and socioeconomic conditions that underlie the success of an indigenous technology which has for centuries exploited the potential for runoff harvesting by i) optimizing water management for agriculture; and ii) minimizing soil loss. Today, siltation of reservoirs, privatization of water resources, and generalized mining of groundwater, pose a threat to the sustainability of these water-harvesting systems. The ongoing transformation of this common resource pool is critically assessed.

AB Based on the interest of organic and conventional farmers in Iowa in long-term analysis of organic systems, the Neely-Kinyon Long-Term Agroecological Research (LTAR) site was established in 1998 to examine the agronomic and economic performance of conventional and organic systems, using certified organic production practices. We report the results of the economic analysis from 3 years of production (1999-2001). Using organic price premiums for organic crops, returns for corn within the organic corn-soybean-oat and corn-soybean-oat-alfalfa rotations were significantly greater than conventional corn-soybean rotation returns (US$126 ha(-1)). Corn returns were not significantly different between the two organic rotations, at US$655 ha(-1) and US$674 ha(-1), respectively. Returns for soybean within the organic corn-soybean-oat and corn-soybean-oat-alfalfa rotations were not significantly different, at US$1233 ha(-1) and US$1326 ha(-1), respectively. Organic soybean returns were significantly greater than conventional soybean crop returns (US$235 ha(-1)) in the corn-soybean rotation. Rotational 3-year average returns were US$180 ha(-1) for the conventional corn-soybean rotation, compared to US$734 ha(-1) for the organic corn-soybean-oat and US$739 ha(-1) for the organic corn-soybean-oat-alfalfa rotation.

SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ALTERNATIVE AGRICULTURE

   pigweed; sustainable agriculture; weed survival

AB The development of production systems that provide the benefits of reduced tillage and also reduce or eliminate herbicide inputs presents a challenge to practitioners of sustainable agriculture. This research was conducted to evaluate management approaches for minimum-tillage corn production in a hairy vetch cover crop, specifically, mechanical versus herbicidal methods for pre-plant cover-crop kill and for post-emergence control of emerged weeds. Pre-plant treatments included 2,4-D [(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)acetic acid] plus residual herbicides, 2,4-D alone, flail mower, corn stalk chopper, light disk and heavy disk. The pre-plant herbicide treatments were followed by a post-emergence treatment of dicamba, whereas the pre-plant mechanical treatments were followed by post-emergence cultivation, as needed, for weed control. The mechanical treatments that kept residue on the soil surface (mower, stalk chopper and light disk) killed hairy vetch when it was flowering, but not when vegetative. The herbicide treatment with pre-plant 2,4-D alone, followed by dicamba post-emergence, controlled annual broadleaf weeds (the dominant species in these experiments) similarly to treatment with 2,4-D plus residual herbicides, suggesting that residual herbicides may be eliminated in cover-crop-based no-tillage systems. The pre-plant mechanical treatments followed by cultivation did not control annual broadleaf weeds as well as herbicide treatments, but did maintain final populations below threshold levels in two of four experiments. The stalk chopper and light disk left high levels of vetch residue on the soil surface, and reduced initial broadleaf weed populations compared with the heavy disk that incorporated residue. However, broadleaf weed populations were reduced with less efficiency by cultivation of untilled soil following the stalk chopper or light disk (38-69%) than by cultivation of tilled soil following the heavy disk (87-95%). Thus, although maintaining surface cover-crop residue without tillage initially reduced weed emergence, it also reduced the efficiency of cultivation, leading to similar final weed populations in all mechanical-based, pre-plant treatments.

AB A number of trends in the development arena-a renewed commitment to lifting billions of people out of poverty, the need to draw and put to use the lessons of experience, and the emergence of "evidence-based" policy making-create daunting professional challenges for evaluation. Development evaluation has long been nearly invisible within the evaluation community. But by emphasising results-based approaches to global public policy, recent UN conferences on development finance (in Monterrey, Mexico) and on environmentally and socially sustainable development (in Johannesburg, South Africa) have attracted worldwide attention and moved development evaluation to center stage. These conferences have brought to the fore the need to enhance the management of poverty reduction programs in developing countries, as well as the reciprocal obligations of developed countries to increase aid volumes, improve aid quality, and level the playing field of international trade. In this new enabling environment, development evaluation has been called upon to track the progress being made towards the UN sponsored Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and to contribute to the improved design and implementation of development policies and programs at local, country, and global levels. These are challenging tasks and it is no longer acceptable that evaluators working for progress in the zones of turmoil and transition where 80% of the world's population lives should labor in isolation. They require a mechanism for professional connectivity and mutual support. To meet this need, 60 evaluators from developing countries and development organizations met in Beijing in September 2002 to found the International Development Evaluation Association, or IDEAS. This new wing of the international evaluation architecture has been designed to support development evaluators in tackling the professional challenges of the new century.
