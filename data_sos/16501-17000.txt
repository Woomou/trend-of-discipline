AB The primary purpose of an improved water supply and sanitation is the achievement of acceptable health and hygiene standards as well as the sustainable improvement of the environment. Many governments recognize this and so they budget for large sums of money to improve these services to the communities. The purpose of this study was to investigate the different gaps in environmental health and hygiene practices with the aim of suggesting a strategy of improving this in the Northern Province of South Africa. To do this, 231 households and 30 schools were surveyed. Workshops and visits to different government departments were also used. This paper reports the results from this study which-indicate that the situation In schools was not any better than that in households, with more than 90% of the villages still dependent on the unimproved pit latrines and 56,6% relying on standpipes which were (70% of the time) non-operational. The main problems identified seem to those associated with implementation and maintenance. The study concludes that with proper training of the water committees and their active involvement with the government and NGOs, environmental health and hygiene problems can be minimized or eliminated.

DE benchmarking; developing areas; performance indicators; sanitation;
   water supplies
AB There is a move throughout the developed world to introduce benchmarking techniques to the management of water and sanitation systems. The indicators that are being considered for benchmarking purposes tend to cover a broad band of activities that are part of the scope of management of large organisations. Most of the lists that have been prepared do not really cater for the implementation and operation of small rural schemes. The greatest need is the Implementation of sustainable schemes for this category of consumer.
   The implementation of a rural water and sanitation scheme involves the negotiation in the initial stages with the local community representatives of what the community wants and how it will be provided and operated. This may have to be preceded by a period of empowerment so that the negotiations can be conducted by informed people. At the conclusion of the negotiations a business plan can be prepared that should be implemented in association with the community. The project is at this stage mainly in the control of a professional engineer, responsible for the technical interpretation of the business plan and the management of the construction phase. Finally, after commissioning, a water service provider will be responsible for the operation, management and maintenance of the scheme on a sustainable basis.
   The key actions and activities are identified and performance criteria defined. As communication at the beginning of the project is a critical component, the success of this is confirmed by examination and discussion as to how much has in fact been communicated and understood correctly. Other performance indicators for the operational phase are derived from the conventional ones used in the developed world. Finally, it is important that the participants, do not see the measurement of performance as a threatening situation, but rather a stepping stone to improvement of not only performance, but also of subsequent reward.

AB In the Netherlands, interest in advanced treatment is increasing now that almost all wastewater treatment plants apply full biological treatment and nutrient removal. The resulting effluents have an excellent quality which can be improved further by applying advanced treatment processes like flocculating filtration, membrane filtration, UV or activated carbon, and others. The treated effluent can be re-used for various purposes, as process water, household water, urban water, for groundwater suppletion and drinking water. Nowadays many applications are investigated. In order to confirm the applicability pilot test investigations are done at various WWTPs. The results are promising; the cost estimations show increasing prospects. This will finally lead to the maturity of the advanced treatment. It will certainly contribute to a more sustainable water cycle.

AB Environmental regulations in the European Union, based on the concept of integrated prevention and control of pollution, are oriented towards the sustainability of the production processes, and this leads to better recovery of resources from raw materials, energy saving, etc. This philosophy introduces a new framework to Environmental Engineers, who have to make efforts concerning waste minimisation. During the last few decades technologies based on the anaerobic treatment of wastewaters and organic wastes have been applied successfully to a wide variety of problems. A case study on the impact of applying anaerobic technology to the treatment of wastewaters from the sugar industry in Spain is presented. Nowadays, processes based on anaerobic treatment appear to be an excellent option as the core of an integrated process for waste and wastewater treatment.

AB Starch manufacturing industrial units, such as sago mills, both at medium and large scale, suffer from inadequate treatment and disposal problems due to high concentration of suspended solid content present in the effluent. In order to investigate the viability of treatment of sago effluent, a laboratory scale study was conducted. The treatment of sago effluent was studied in a continuous flow anaerobic fluidized bed reactor. The start-up of the reactor was carried out using a mixture of digested supernatant sewage sludge and cow dung slurry in different proportions. The effect of operating variables such as COD of the effluent, bed expansion, minimum fluidization velocity on efficiency of treatment and recovery of biogas was investigated. The treated wastewater was analysed for recycling and reuse to ensure an alternative for sustainable water resourse management. The maximum efficiency of treatment was found to be 82% and the nitrogen enriched digested sludge was recommended for agricultural use.

AB Anaerobic treatment is well over 100 years old. Its initial development was for the treatment of domestic wastewaters, using anaerobic filters and hybrid processes that are still of interest today. It then progressed in application to separate sludge digestion, then to treatment of dilute industrial wastewaters. Several processes have been developed that accomplish efficient treatment of wastewaters at short detention times Major contributions to the broad application of anaerobic treatment and the better understanding of this process has come from efforts by G. Lettinga and his colleagues. They have emphasized its importance for meeting the need for sustainable development in the future. Greater efforts are now needed for broad application of anaerobic treatment for ridding the environment of unwanted organic materials by converting them into methane, a renewable energy source.

AB Anaerobic degradation of dead biomass is a natural gasification process, an anaerobic crematorium producing a very useful end-product composed of methane and carbon dioxide, generally polluted with small amounts of some malodorous and quite toxic volatile S-compounds. It leads to the production of essential building elements for new life. This exciting field became my faith, vision, hope and expectation. This paper intends to present a reflection of more than three decades of research, teaching and advertisement in the field of sustainable environmental protection technologies, particularly of systems based on anaerobic digestion and the biological sulphur cycle, Considerable progress has been made during these decades worldwide, both in the basic understanding of the various processes and concepts, but also in the implementation of these systems, despite the fact that particularly the implementation frequently proceeded very laboriously. The difficulties certainly can no longer be attributed to technological limitations and/or insufficient understanding of the microbiology and chemistry only, but mainly to the frustrating social rigidity and short-term self-interest in all sectors of our society. By combining anaerobic processes with other microbiological degradation or transformation processes, like those based on the biological sulphur cycle, micro-aerobic and conventional aerobic and anoxic processes, ideal conditions can be created to valorise residues (wastes) from domestic, industrial and agricultural origin. It is simply not just "technology", but also a route to achieve more sustainability and justice in society. It is a fight against conservative establishments. Decomposition, disintegration disbandment, it also stands for deliverance and liberation, space and air for continuation of life.

AB The increasing scarcity of clean water sets the need for appropriate management of available water resources. Particularly regions suffering from a lack of water urgently need integrated environmental protection and resource conservation (EP and RC) technologies in order to enable effective management of the available water resources. EP and RC-concepts focus on pollution prevention and on a minimum of consumptive use of energy, chemicals, and water in pollution abatement and a maximum of re-use of treated wastewater, by-products and residues produced in the treatment of waste and wastewater. Consequently, by implementing these concepts, waste(water)s like sewage and industrial effluents become an important source of water, fertilisers, soil conditioners and (frequently) energy instead of a social threat. In addition, a bridge is made between environmental protection and agriculture practice, stimulating (urban) agriculture in the neighbourhood of large cities.
   Anaerobic treatment is considered as the core technology for mineralising organic compounds in waste(water) streams. Additional technologies are required to comply with the reuse criteria. Some examples of possible EP and RC concepts, using the anaerobic treatment technology for the reclamation of domestic sewage are discussed.

AB The continued productivity, profitability and sustainability of animal production agriculture in most parts of the world will be dependent upon implementation of effective technologies and management practices to mitigate perceived and documented environmental impacts resulting from confined animal operation emissions. North Carolina State University Animal and Poultry Waste Management Center (APWMC) program efforts to identify such technologies through support of research, development and demonstration projects involve collaborative efforts with approximately 20 other universities (nationally and internationally). Many of these projects are well beyond the laboratory developmental stage and some are yielding encouraging results. Performance data, to date, has shown that swine manure treatment systems including a covered in-ground anaerobic digester, a sequencing batch reactor, and an upflow biological aerated filter system significantly improved odor emission variables.

AB Gdansk water supply system belongs among the oldest in Continental Europe. In 1992 one of the first joint-venture water companies was established in the city. Under a contract concluded between the firm and the municipality, the company was obliged to secure quick and considerable improvement of drinking water quality. At the same time a considerable water consumption decrease was observed. The drop entails new environmental, technical and economic problems. The biggest threat to the supplies of safe and good quality water is the phenomenon of secondary pollution of water resulting from the overdimensioning of the water supply network. Positive aspects of water consumption decrease are related to the opportunity of more rational and sustainable water resources management. The solutions adopted in Gdansk can serve as a starting point for working out the best model for water quality management in the coastal cities.

AB Wastewater treatment by constructed wetland is an appropriate technology for tropical developing countries like Indonesia because it is inexpensive, easily maintained, and has environmentally friendly and sustainable characteristics. The aim of the research is to examine the capability of constructed wetlands for treating laboratory wastewater at our Center, to investigate the suitable flow for treatment, namely vertical subsurface or horizontal surface flow, and to study the effect of the seasons. The constructed wetland is composed of three chambered unplanted sedimentation tanks followed by the first and second beds, containing gravel and sand, planted with Typha sp.; the third bed planted with floating plant Lemna sp.; and a clarifier with two chambers. The results showed that the subsurface flow in the dry season removed 95% organic carbon (COD) and total phosphorus (T-P) respectively, and 82% total nitrogen (T-N). In the transition period from the dry season to the rainy season, COD removal efficiency decreased to 73%, T-N increased to 89%, and T-P was almost the same as that in the dry season. In the rainy season COD and T-N removal efficiencies increased again to 95% respectively, while T-P remained unchanged. In the dry season, COD and T-P concentrations in the surface flow showed that the removal efficiencies were a bit lower than those in the subsurface flow. Moreover, T-N removal efficiency was only half as much as that in the subsurface flow. However, in the transition period, COD removal efficiency decreased to 29%, while T-N increased to 74% and T-P was still constant, around 93%. In the rainy season, COD and T-N removal efficiencies increased again to almost 95%. On the other hand, T-P decreased to 76%. The results show that the constructed wetland is capable of treating the laboratory wastewater. The subsurface flow is more suitable for treatment than the surface flow, and the seasonal changes have effects on the removal efficiency.

AB Recycling water is an important aspect of water resource and environment management policies, ensuring reliable alternative water resources, reducing environmental pollution and achieving a more sustainable form of development. This paper focuses on wastewater reuse as a strategy for integrated water management. Key economic, financial, regulatory, social and technical factors that help to make water reuse projects successful are reviewed. Selected examples from Northern and Western Europe and arid and semiarid Mediterranean regions illustrate the contribution of wastewater reuse to integrated management of water resources.

AB To obtain a sustainable water catchment in the dune area of the Flemish west coast, the integration of treated domestic wastewater in the existing potable water production process is planned. The hygienic hazards associated with the introduction of treated domestic wastewater into the water cycle are well recognised. Therefore, the concept of HACCP (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points) was used to guarantee hygienically safe drinking water production. Taking into account the literature data on the removal efficiencies of the proposed advanced treatment steps with regard to enteric viruses and protozoa and after setting high quality limits based on the recent progress in quantitative risk assessment, the critical control points (CCPs) and points of attention (POAs) were identified. Based on the HACCP analysis a specific monitoring strategy was developed which focused on the control of these CCPs and POAs.

DE sustainable water security; global water convention; ethics and equity
AB Trends in water consumption indicate that demand for water for household and industrial uses in developing countries could double as a proportion of total water demand in the next 25 years. Scope for expansion of water supply will, at the same time, be limited because development of irrigation and urban water supplies is becoming increasingly expensive, and often involves high costs in terms of environmental degradation and human resettlement. Without fundamental reform of water management, the rapid growth in urban water demand will require large transfers of water from irrigated agriculture, thereby threatening food security. Hence, water supply and demand should be managed in an integrated fashion, simultaneously considering all uses and sources. This will call for the establishment of community centred food and water security systems and national water trusts.
   Once such systems and Trusts are established there could be a legally binding Global Water Convention on the model of the Global Convention on Climate and Biodiversity. The details of such a Global Water Conventions can be finalized at one of the future Stockholm Water Symposia. There are uncommon opportunities today for a water-secure world through synergy between technology, public policy and peoples' participation.

AB Growing concern about the declining state of the catchment and river led to the formation of the Blackwood Basin Group in 1992. Funded primarily by the Natural Heritage Trust and using the river as the focus. the group aims to provide leadership and support to achieve sustainable management of natural resources in the catchment. Through an Integrated Catchment Management approach, the Blackwood Basin Group has managed a range of projects to improve the community's understanding and management of the Blackwood River and its catchment. A number of research, education, demonstration and on-ground action activities relating to river management have been undertaken in partnership with community and local, state and federal government organisations. Activities include demonstrations and evaluations of riparian restoration, funding riparian restoration activities, protection of high conservation value remnant vegetation, a flood risk study, zone action planning and monitoring the condition of the river and its tributaries.

AB The Brisbane River and Moreton Bay Study, an interdisciplinary study of Moreton Bay and its major tributaries, was initiated to address water quality issues which link sewage and diffuse loading with environmental degradation. Runoff and deposition of fine-grained sediments into Moreton Bay, followed by resuspension, have been linked with increased turbidity and significant loss of seagrass habitat. Sewage-derived nutrient enrichment, particularly nitrogen (N), has been linked to algal blooms by sewage plume maps. Blooms of a marine cyanobacterium, Lyngbya majuscula, in Moreton Bay have resulted in significant impacts on human health (e.g., contact dermatitis) and ecological health (e.g., seagrass loss), and the availability of dissolved iron from acid sulfate soil runoff has been hypothesised. The impacts of catchment activities resulting in runoff of sediments, nutrients and dissolved iron on the health of the Moreton Bay waterways are addressed.
   The Study, established by 6 local councils in association with two state departments in 1994, forms a regional component of a national and state program to achieve ecologically sustainable use of the waterways by protecting and enhancing their health, while maintaining economic and social development. The Study framework illustrates a unique integrated approach to water quality management whereby scientific research, community participation and the strategy development were done in parallel with each other. This collaborative effort resulted in a water quality management strategy which focuses on the integration of socioeconomic and ecological values of the waterways. This work has led to significant cost savings in infrastructure by providing a clear focus on initiatives towards achieving healthy waterways. The Study's Stage 2 initiatives form the basis for this paper.

AB Even though urban drainage has been practised for more than 5000 years, many challenges arising from growing demands on drainage still remain with respect to runoff quantity and quality; landscape aesthetics, ecology and beneficial uses; and operation of existing urban wastewater systems. Further advances can be achieved by adopting an integrated approach, optimal operation of the existing infrastructure, advanced pollution and runoff source controls, improved resilience of receiving waters, and adaptive water management. The specific research needs include new technologies and strategies for stormwater management, advanced treatment of urban wet-weather effluents, and tools for analysis and operation of drainage systems. High diversity of demands on, and region/site specific conditions of, urban drainage shapes the role of urban drainage experts - as mediators among the many stakeholders and fields involved.

AB Ecological impairment and flooding caused by urbanization can be expressed numerically by calculating the risks throughout the watershed (floodplain) and along the main stems of the streams. The risks can be evaluated in terms of the present and/or future. This article describes the methodologies for ascertaining the risks in the Geographical Information Systems (GIS) environment. The objectives of urban flood controls and ecological preservation/restoration of urban waters are often conflicting and, in the past, the sole emphasis on flood control led to destruction of habitat and deterioration of water quality.
   An optimal solution to these two problems may be achieved by linking the risks to the concepts of risk communication, risk perception, and public willingness to pay for projects leading to ecological restoration and ecologically sustainable flood control. This method is appropriate because. in each case. public funds are used and the projects require approval and backing of policy makers and stakeholders. This article briefly describes a research project that attempts to resolve the conflict between the flood protection and stream ecological preservation and restoration and suggests alternative ways of expressing benefits of urban stream flood control and restoration projects.

AB Many of Australia's Fiver systems have been seriously degraded by inappropriate management of regulated flows. Other systems are facing threats from future water resources developments. There is a lack of information available to aid in allocation of environmental Rows to rivers in order that they are managed in an ecologically sustainable manner. The Environmental Flows Initiative (EFI) is a major Australia-wide R&D program into environmental flows, funded through the Natural Heritage Trust (NHT), and administered by Environment Australia (EA). The program aims to identify environmental values, undertake targeted research to identify risks to river systems and flow requirements to sustain environmental values, to trial flow management options, and to evaluate these trials. The NHT relies on matching funding provided by the State and Territory authorities, and supports integrative approaches with emphasis on works on-the-ground where possible. While the EFI will close significant knowledge gaps, other gaps remain. Some of these relate to development and validation of rapid assessment techniques, understanding the importance of flow variability and how to define it, manipulation of flows to control alien species, developing a system of prioritising rivers for environmental Rows, and enhancing flows with other catchment, channel and floodplain rehabilitation measures.

AB Within the framework of a research programme into more sustainable wastewater treatment systems based on physical-chemical pretreatment the application of dissolved air flotation (DAF) with polyelectrolytes as a primary treatment was investigated. Experiments with municipal wastewater were carried out in 2.5 l flotation batches and in a 100 l DAF pilot reactor. Two cationic polyelectrolytes (PEs) with molecular weights of 4 x 10(6) g/mol and 8 x 10(6) g/mol, were tested. The higher weight PE was more effective in removing turbidity and was used in the pilot experiments for coagulation/flocculation. Within the pilot system experiments the dry solids concentration of the float layer as well as the removal efficiencies of turbidity, CODparticulate, CODdissolved and nutrients, were studied. Typical results were that the obtained dry solids concentration of the floated sludge was 10%, when the float layer was removed after several hours. By using polyelectrolytes it was possible to remove more than 80% of CODparticulate and turbidity at dosages of 7-8 mg/g influent COD (i.e. 5 mg PE/100 NTU). The removal efficiency of CODdissolved was low. There was a proportional relationship between CODparticulate and turbidity. This led to the conclusions that by introducing a dosing control strategy based on continuous turbidity measurements a constant CODparticulate removal efficiency can be obtained.

AB Within the scope of a research programme into wastewater treatment scenarios based on physical-chemical pretreatment, the application of direct influent filtration (DIF) as a first treatment step in a wastewater treatment system was investigated. The aim of the experimental research was to investigate the feasibility of DIF as a pretreatment step for advanced particle removal. With a large scale pilot-plant filter at WWTP Leiden-Noord, The Netherlands the removal characteristics for suspended and colloidal material were investigated as well as operational conditions of eight different filter configurations. From the experimental research it was concluded that filtration of raw wastewater is possible, notwithstanding the relatively short runtimes due to clogging. In general, the filters produced a filtrate with a constant quality with low concentrations of solids and low turbidity. Without addition of chemicals hardly any colloids and solubles were retained, but only suspended particulates were removed. After dosage of iron or polymer, it was possible to remove more suspended matter and a high proportion of colloidal material. Finally it was concluded that DIF could be applied as a compact treatment system to produce a high quality primary effluent with a constant composition, but for practical application further research has to be done.

AB The 'big pipes in, big pipes out' approach to urban water management was developed in the 19th century for a particular linear urban form. Large, sprawling car-dependent cities are pushing this approach to new limits in rich cities and it has never worked in poor cities. An alternative which uses new small-scale technology and is more community-based, is suggested for both rich and poor countries. The Sydney Olympics and a demonstration project in Java show that the approach can work.

However, to address water issues "outside the corporate fenceline" will require creative new public-private partnerships. Government's role is to provide sound framework conditions that will encourage businesses to invest time, staff and resources to address vital fresh water issues. Industry is committed to best practice within its internal operations and is ready to enter into partnerships to address broader fresh water issues.

AB "Business as usual is not an option." Water management practices are changing too slowly and the global "fresh water gap" continues to grow. Actions as must be taken by government and civic leaders. Industry also has a responsibility to act, but its inability to adequately meet the challenge to date points to the need for additional stimuli.
   The current water crisis can be mitigated by changes in behaviour and perceptions. This presentation will argue that specific catalysts are required to encourage and support a dramatic shift of behaviours and perceptions by industry leaders. The catalysts include: establish clear and objective rules; introduce water pricing; recognize "life cycle" costs; prioritize needs; reward small-scale solutions; nurture innovations; spread global best practices
   With the help of the catalysts described herein, industry can take its place as a leader in effective water management in the 21 st Century. In partnership with governments, international organizations and civic organizations, industry leaders can help meet the challenge of the water crisis while creating sustainable economic growth.

DE nutrient removal; nitrogen; effluent; anaerobic; food processing;

AB Food processing effluents often contain high levels of nutrients, particularly N. Conventionally, anaerobic ponds are used to purify these effluents in Australia, giving cost-effective removal of BOD but little nutrient removal. It has become apparent that disposal by irrigation as presently practised normally exceeds sustainable N application rates, thus reduction of nutrient levels before irrigation is becoming mandatory. Meatworks effluent is often discharged to country town sewers, frequently accounting for 50-75% of the nutrient load. Meatworks effluents contain 1,000-4,000 mg/L BOD, 200-400 mg/L TKN and 20-50 mg/L P. Conventional BNR technology can readily remove nutrients from such effluents, either alone or in combination with anaerobic ponds but sludge handling on such a small scale poses economic problems.
   Laboratory scale trials showed that both BOD removal from meatworks effluent and sludge disposal could be achieved readily in conventional anaerobic ponds. The pond effluent, together with the town sewage ii required, could be treated in a sequencing batch reactor (SBR) designed for nitrification/denitrification service. Optimisation of the anaerobic pond operation was required to ensure production of the minimum BOD:N ratio needed for N removal. This paper will describe the design and commissioning of two plants; a demonstration plant installed at a typical sized meatworks in Gippsland, Victoria, and a full scale plant for treatment of combined domestic sewage and effluent from a large meatworks at Longford, Tasmania. In neither case (for different reasons) has P removal yet been required. It was demonstrated that 98% of BOD and up to 95% N removal may be cheaply and readily achieved in the SBR. Where lagoons are used, levels of N suitable for river discharge can be achieved. P can be readily removed by alum treatment when required.

AB This paper reports on integrated watershed-based protection and sustainable use of water resources to increase the effectiveness of water pollution abatement. The approach includes improvements in end-of-pipe waste-water treatment technologies and implementation of Cleaner Production (CP) principles and policies within the watershed. An example of the general effectiveness of this approach is illustrated by the Czech Odra River Cleaner Production Project where reductions in pollution were achieved with improved industrial production. The CP theme is worth considering as an important challenge for the IWA.

AB Three lowland streams in developed pasture catchments with different farming intensities exhibited contrasting summer diurnal variations in pH, DO and temperature. These are ascribed to differences in dominant aquatic vegetation and their respective effects on shade, and on photosynthetic production and respiration within each stream. The stream dominated by submerged macrophytes had the greatest amplitude swings in DO and pH, and DO levels of 86-128% saturation. Floating marginal macrophytes reduced photosynthetic inputs while providing additional organic loading for respiration, with consequent fiat DO and pH curves and conditions not conducive to healthy stream ecosystems. The third stream was shaded by riparian plants, which inhibited photosynthetic effects on DO and pH so that diurnal variation was intermediate between the other two streams. The interaction between nutrients and increased insolation in agricultural catchments, in stimulating aquatic plants, needs to be better understood for managing the sustainability of stream habitats and ecosystems.

AB The paper examines progress towards integrated catchment management and sustainable agriculture at Whaingaroa (Raglan), New Zealand. Application of the Canadian "Atlantic Coastal Action Program" model (ACAP) has been only partially successful within New Zealand's bicultural setting. Even before the introduction of the ACAP process there existed strong motivation and leadership by various sectors of the community. A merging of resource management planning and implementation processes of the larger community and that of the Maori community has not occurred. Research carried out by Crown Research Institutes has clearly shown the actions required to make pastoral farming more sustainable. There are difficulties in the transference to, and uptake of, these techniques by farmers. An examination of the socio-economic context is required. There has been a requirement on local government bodies to tighten their focus as part of recent reform. This has occurred concurrently with a widening of vision towards integrated and sustainable forms of management. This (as well as a clear belief in empowerment of focal communities) has lead to Council reliance on voluntary labour. There is a need to account for the dynamic interaction between social and political history and the geological and biophysical history of the area. As part of a re-examination of sustainable development, New Zealand needs to reconcile the earning of the bulk of its foreign income from primary production, with the accelerating ecological deficit that it creates. A sustainability strategy is required linking consumer demand, property rights and responsibilities.

AB While "institutional failure" is commonly cited as a core barrier to sustainable resource management, operational prescriptions or criteria for institutional design are rare. Institutions are crucial, and may be barriers or opportunities. This article offers some principles and design features for "adaptive" institutions, capable of balancing the core principles of persistence, purposefulness, information-richness, inclusiveness and flexibility. It then draws on emerging findings from recent Australian research to identify some major institutional barriers and opportunities for improving capacities in sustainable resource management.

AB The Brantas is one of Indonesia's most important catchments. It is the "rice bowl" of Java and nationally important for its industrial activity. Surabaya, Indonesia's second largest city, is located at the mouth of the Brantas River which is pivotal to the city's water supply. The challenges associated with the institutional framework for natural resource management in East Java parallels that of many states and provinces around the globe. It is multi-layered and complex.
   Integrated Catchment Management (ICM) may be defined as "the co-ordinated and sustainable management of land, water, soil vegetation, fauna and other natural resources on a water catchment basis". Over a period of six months, an ICM Strategy was researched and facilitated for the Brantas River Catchment in East Java via a short term advisor attachment. The aim of the Strategy is to improve coordination, co-operation, communication and consistency of government and community efforts towards sustaining the catchment's environmental, economic and social values. The attachment was part of the Pollution Control Implementation (PCI) Project funded by AusAid and the Indonesian Government.
   The ICM Strategy developed was broad based and addressed the priority natural resource management issues facing the Brantas Catchment. It was co-ordinated by BAPEDALDA, the Provincial Environmental Protection Agency, and developed by all agencies involved in natural resource management in the catchment. Various Universities and Non Government Organisations (NGOs) were also involved in the ICM process which developed the Strategy. At the conclusion of the attachments a draft ICM Strategy and a proposed institutional framework had been developed. A working group of key agencies was also established to further enhance local "ownership", finalise timescales and implementation responsibilities within the Strategy and bring the institutional arrangements into being through a Governor's Decree.

AB The presence of indigenous property rights and interests arising from the survival of native title in Australia presents unique issues in the management of rivers and riverine lands. Existing common law and statutory tidal and non-tidal rights are a complex overlay of public and private property rights which are themselves undergoing significant change through the commodification of many natural resources by Commonwealth and State governments, such as marine species stock and non-tidal water. The melding of indigenous values and management practices with existing management regimes for rivers and riverine lands offers considerable potential for both sustainability of resource utilisation, and respect and recognition of native title with resultant predicted benefits in the vexed area of compensation.

AB Research on sustainable transport and water projects, conducted in North America during 1999, identified four key considerations common to a number of projects. These four considerations are the preconditions necessary to achieve sustainability in a given location. These preconditions (BAPP) are boundary definition, administrative alignment, protection of non-urban lands, and the participation of all interested parties.
   This paper considers the perceived attitudes of various catchment stakeholders and focuses on planners and planning. The results of questionnaire surveys based on BAPP concepts suggest that local government is perceived as having the highest priority for protection of riparian lands and waterways (as individual Councils and Regional Organisations of Councils). Thus local government is the preferred arena for coordination, responsibility and jurisdiction of waterways and riparian land. The opportunity exists to examine the differing roles of local and state government. The paper concludes by outlining the implications of this research for land use planning and institutional structures in sustainable river management.

AB To enable decision makers to select sustainable wastewater treatment systems, insight into the sustainability of a wide variety of systems should be provided in a transparent way leaving room for adaptation and interpretation according to the local situation. To provide this insight a structured methodology comparing wastewater treatment systems with respect to sustainability is defined. Similar to life cycle assessment (LCA) three phases can be distinguished: (I)goal and scope definition, (2) inventory analysis, and (3) optimisation and results. In the goal and scope definition we set the system boundaries to include most of the water cycle and part of the food cycle. Furthermore, we defined a multi-disciplinary set of sustainability indicators including technical. economic, environmental, and socio-cultural aspects. In the inventory analysis these sustainability indicators are quantified using simple static models of wastewater unit operations. Selection of unit operations results in a model of a complete wastewater treatment system. In the optimisation phase the decision maker can weigh the different sustainability indicators and select sustainable options through integer programming.

AB In an environmental systems analysis of four wastewater systems. the environmental aspects were prioritised by normalisation of predicted impacts from the studied systems to the total impacts from society. Priority Group 1 (highest priority) consisted of discharges (flows) of nitrogen, cadmium. lead and mercury to water, recycling of nitrogen and phosphorus to arable land and flows of heavy metals to arable land. A conventional wastewater system (A) was compared to irrigation of energy forest with biologically treated wastewater (B), liquid composting of toilet wastewater (C) and a conventional system supplemented with urine separation (D). Analysing the aspects in priority group one, systems B-D improved the management of plant nutrients and decreased the flow of heavy metals to water, while the flow to arable land increased, especially for system B. The suggested method is useful in municipal environmental planning and when choosing a wastewater system.

AB The concepts of waste design and source control are introduced as contracts between wastewater handling agencies and consumers and consumers and industry respectively. Waste design serves to produce waste streams that are optimized in composition and time sequence for easy transport and treatment. Source control makes services and installations available, which allow the consumer to adhere to the specifications of waste design. Increased delegation of responsibility to the consumer is expected to result in more flexible wastewater handling systems.

TI Monitoring Crocodylus porosus populations in the Northern Territory of
   Australia: a retrospective power analysis
SO WILDLIFE RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID STATISTICAL POWER; TRENDS
AB In the Northern Territory of Australia, populations of the estuarine crocodile (Crocodylus porosus) have been subject to an annual egg harvest since the early 1980s. Since 1997, adult and juvenile crocodiles have also been harvested in some catchments. Annual surveys of crocodile populations are conducted in order to ensure that the harvest is sustainable. Boat surveys commenced in 1975 and helicopter surveys commenced in 1989. Retrospective power analysis was used to determine whether the sampling program meets the objectives of the Crocodile Management Program for the Northern Territory. Data collected during boat surveys vary in quality between river systems. The analysis of pooled data from 7 river systems with a residual standard deviation of 0.11 indicates that the power of the current spotlight survey method to detect a decline of 10% per annum in around 4 years is about 0.9. In this time the population would decline by around 33% and would fully recover in 8 years following the removal of the factor causing the decline. This allows detection of a decline within one-third, and recovery within two-thirds, of the estimated generation time of the saltwater crocodile and will allow management actions to be implemented before the impacts on populations are serious. The data from helicopter and boat surveys from a 10-year period were compared. Helicopter surveys did not provide useful management information.

AB Analyzing household survey data from three microfinance program sites, we provide an early systematic assessment of Chinese microfinance programs, which have grown rapidly since 1994, are based on the Grameen model, and include an unprecedented large-scale government initiative. We examine the empirical propositions that underpin successful microfinance programs-reaching the poor (targeting), financial and operational performance (sustainability), and program benefits (impact). We find that nongovernmental programs perform well in all three areas, but that governmental programs perform poorly. Given the remote location and focus on agricultural projects in China's poor areas, we advocate greater flexibility in loan contract terms, especially repayment schedules.

AB This article examines the relation between poor women and men and common property resources (cprs). It locates poor people's use of cprs within a wider focus on sustainable livelihoods, which argues that development initiatives need to build on people's assets and strengths, and identifies cprs as a crucial element of poor people's coping and adaptive strategies. The article considers evidence from India and West Africa with a particular focus on poverty reduction, equity, gender and management issues. Development agencies and governments which have re-focused their attention on poverty in recent years will find that cprs provide an entry point to understanding poor people's perceptions of poverty and for building on their capacities.

AB Arashiyama National Forest, located in the northwestern part of Kyoto city, is one of the most famous tourist sites in japan with about 10 million visitors per year. The 59.03 ha of forest landscape attracts many people throughout Japan and abroad for its beautiful combinations of cherry blossom, red pine and other deciduous broadleaf trees. From a historical point of view. the forests comprising Arashiyama National Forest were first treated in "unspecified" but "complex" ways, to maintain their preferable landscapes. As the Modem Ages (from 1870) began with the Japanese national government becoming the new administrator of forests, a new forest system in Japan was implemented. leading to forest management systems characterised by "specialisation" and "clarification". In trying to maintain the ideal landscape or functions, legislations declared prohibited acts. but failed to take into account the effects of one measure upon the other. and/or failed to clarify acceptable actions. This resulted in drastic changes in forest landscape. Our purposes of study were (1) to evaluate the landscape plans and managements based on the changes within the 25 land units demarcated in the landscape management plan of 1931, and (2) to present the relationships between public awareness and landscape management in Arashiyama after the year 1255. Through our investigations and analysis, we conclude that it is very important to conserve sustainable. historical, aesthetic forest landscape. and to take each specific and clarified management objective and system as an individual piece as well as part of a whole picture. We also suggest that administrative affairs alone would not be sufficient to interact and integrate each management purpose. Restoring the cultural interactions between people and landscape is strongly needed for future local landscape planning and management. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Local authorities face a great challenge in translating officially announced sustainability commitments into everyday management practices. With the objective of developing a tool for supporting such goal-to-practice translation processes, three primary tool criteria were formulated, and used to develop a guide on how to apply the tool. Subsequently, the tool was applied and evaluated in an interactive study involving the local authority of a Danish municipality. The first tool criterion concerns the organisation of the translation process. It states that in order to obtain a clear understanding of the unique local conditions, the tool shall be able to act as a bridge between different disciplines, and allow for direct collaboration between experts with context-independent knowledge and local administrators with context-dependent knowledge. The second criterion concerns the identification of sustainable management strategies. It states that the tool shall secure a thorough two-sided analysis of society's claims on one side, and on the other ride the ability of available resources to meet these claims in a sustainable way. The third criterion concerns the distribution of the results of the analysing phase. It states that in order to support dialogue and decision making across professional and societal boundaries, the identified claims and resources as well as the associated obstacles shall be presented in simple and preferably visual overviews. In testing the tool we focused on the ability of the municipality's urban green structure (the resource) to contribute to sustainable management of organic waste, surface runoff and biodiversity (the claims). Based on the outcome of the test, and an interview survey with the participating local administrators, it is concluded that the tool criteria are sound. This is despite the fact that the test of the tool was not applied in full accordance with the tool guidelines. It is anticipated that the application of this tool can increase the speed and extent with which local authorities absorb and employ the concepts of sustainable development in their everyday management and planning tasks.

AB Trees benefit urban communities environmentally. esthetically and recreationally. This raises the question of whether Denmark's towns have enough space for more trees. A research project investigated this by examining in detail the potential for more sustainable planning and management of urban green space in towns with 10,000-40,000 inhabitants and was completed in 1999. The paper describes the vegetation cover in selected urban areas, including the cover of woody vegetation (trees and shrubs) and discusses the land area potentially available for supplementary planting in urban zones. The method used to map urban vegetation is discussed and related to Denmark's administrative practice and planning system. Case studies are presented for various categories of urban land use to highlight the variation in vegetation cover and to identify the land area available for increasing tree cover. Apart from undeveloped urban land, the largest areas potentially available for planting included industrial zones, institutional zones and apartment complexes. Other types of residential district lacked the coherent space normally required for sustainable planting. The cover of trees and shrubs in the case study towns is very limited, but large areas of non-functional lawn could be available for planting. Lawn comprised the largest proportion of the urban surface cover in the case studies. The findings of the case studies were assembled into data sets relating to each type of urban zone and summed up in green structure maps based on geographical information systems. This approach can provide an overview of best practices to allow areas lacking vegetation cover to be identified. This assessment method can usefully be applied to incorporate issues related to the urban natural environment and urban greening potential into conventional planning practice in Denmark's municipalities.

AB Biodiversity conservation in Australian native hardwood production forest is a central aim of sustainable forest management. However, the effects of timber extraction and fuel-reduction burning on the biodiversity of forest invertebrates are poorly understood. In this study, we use hierarchical partitioning and partial canonical correspondence analysis to examine the independent effects of these management practices on the richness and composition of ground-active ant and beetle assemblages. The study makes use of survey data from two types of production forest widespread in north-east New South Wales, New England Blackbutt (Eucalyptus campanulata, R. Baker and H.G. Smith) and Messmate/Forest Ribbon Gum (E. obliqua, L'Her and E. nobilis, L. Johnson and K. Hill). Pitfall-trapped ants, and beetles from the families Carabidae, Scarabaeidae and Pselaphidae, were sorted to morphospecies and these survey data, together with habitat data, were used to explore two questions: (1) how much variation in the richness and composition of the arthropod assemblages at survey sites could be accounted for (independently) by logging and fire history? and (2) were other habitat variables better able to (independently) account for variation in arthropod richness and composition? Answers to these questions were used to identify potential performance indicators of the effects of forest management practices on ground-active arthropod biodiversity. Our analyses found that in New England Blackbutt forest sites, where selective logging was at low intensity, logging history explained little variation in arthropod richness or composition. By contrast, a strong influence of fire history and correlated habitat variables was evident. Fire history also explained significant variation in Messmate/Forest Ribbon Gum forest, but in this forest type, where logging intensity was higher, the influence of logging history was also apparent. This study finds support for the use of measures of ant richness, percent cover of sub-canopy (5-15 m above ground level) and ground-layer characteristics (litter depth, % cover of litter and bare ground) as performance indicators, because these attributes are relatively easy to measure, are affected by forest management, and are indicative of the effects of forest management on ground-active arthropod biodiversity, (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Because of its proximity to Asia, Japan has been populated by humans for a much longer time period than New Zealand and has a much higher population density. The similarity in geology and tectonic setting of the two island groups has forced both peoples to confront similar environmental hazards but this was achieved in different ways. During the Edo period (1600-1868) when contact with outside countries was limited, the Japanese adapted their agricultural practices to the environment and developed an agricultural system that corresponds closely to the ideals of sustainability. Indeed, it can be argued that the farming lifestyle of the Edo period was the most advanced way of life that can be adopted without depleting stock resources. Following the Meiji restoration in 1868, the policy of rapid industrialization led to many environmental mistakes, particularly after World War II. By the end of the 1960s, Japan was the world's most polluted country. The situation has subsequently improved greatly from this low point but much remains to be done. New Zealand was initially occupied by the Maori over 1000 years ago. They did more environmental damage than was previously thought, particularly in burning off bush and destroying the bird life. However, it was the colonization of New Zealand by the Europeans after 1840 that led to the greatest environmental damage with their introduction of farming methods unsuited to the conditions. Although the need for better scientific planning of land use practices within New Zealand is recognized, sustainable management of the environment remains a distant goal. More detailed study of the agricultural methods and lifestyles adopted in Japan during the Edo period could help in defining the concept of sustainability. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

ID CONSERVATION; BIODIVERSITY
AB Traditional tolerance of wild animals, which may be harmful to humans, their settlements and livelihood have contributed substantially to India's successful record of conserving some of the larger mammals and their habitats. This attribute is at variance with the developed world, where a number of large mammals have been extirpated through active eradication campaigns. Incorporating intrinsic traditional tolerance has so far, not featured in the country's conservation planning. On a broader level, the UNESCO Man and Biosphere Reserve concept seeks to combine conservation concerns with sustainable use of ecosystems' resources through close cooperation with local communities, taking advantage of traditional knowledge, indigenous products and appropriate land management. However it falls short of incorporating variance among settlements in their propensity to coexist with wildlife and their habitats into reserve design. This paper, thereby, attempts to augment the biosphere concept by proposing a protocol which discriminates settlements on their propensity for coexisting with wildlife and their habitats. A framework for discrimination is suggested using a set of hypothetical parameters which quantify attributes affecting the coexistence propensity of settlements. Based on this discrimination, a scheme for prioritizing settlements for relocation is elaborated. It is also proposed that the prioritization is considered along with a landscape and socio-economical analysis before ultimate relocation decisions are made.

ID ENERGY ANALYSIS
AB Economic development in agriculture is often accompanied by strong environmental pressures that present risks, which could lead to irreversible damage of the associated agro-ecosystem. A form of agricultural management that utilizes natural resources rationally yet maintains ecological stability is necessary. Ecologically sound, yet productive, use of resources requires indicators that assess not only productive and economic factors, but also environmental impact and ecological effects. Thus, to study an agricultural activity and its interaction with the environment, a holistic approach, capable of considering ecological, biophysical and socio-economic aspects is appropriate. Here we use emergy analysis and its indicators as given in Odum (Science 242 (1988) 1132-1139), to evaluate how sustainability of a soybean crop in south Tuscany (Italy) is increased using the specific bacteria inoculation to satisfy, through fixation, the nitrogen need of the crop. Cultivation was studied with two options: (1) utilization of chemical fertilizers to supply nitrogen needs as often done in the past, and as a viable present alternative and (2) the symbiotic activity of Bradyrhizobium bacteria, given as inoculum, to cover all nitrogen needs. This article shows that proper agricultural management should help maintain, and increase, system capacity, i.e. the quality of the system environment (soil, water,...), to sustain biomass, and prevent environmental degradation. For an Italian agro-ecosystem, the results demonstrate that agricultural production is more than doubled and the use of non-renewable and toxic inputs, such as chemical fertilizers, is reduced by use of the inoculum. The good results for soybean suggests development of analogous cultivation methods for other agricultural species, such as gramineous, for which different N-fixing bacteria such as Azospirillum, have been already identified.

ID MANAGEMENT; PLACE
AB The construct of social embeddedness has helped explain some of the ways in which individuals and organizations form and sustain alliances. We introduce the construct of ecological embeddedness, or the extent to which a manager is rooted in the land. Ecological embeddedness is illustrated by an ethnographic study of a Cree tallyman, or beaver trapper, in Tames Bay, northern Quebec. To be ecologically embedded as a manager is to personally identify with the land, to adhere to beliefs of ecological respect, reciprocity, and caretaking, to actively gather ecological information, and to be physically located in the ecosystem. We conclude by drawing some implications for sustainability.

ID SANDGROUSE
AB This study investigated the potential overlap between breeding and hunting seasons for a population of common quail Coturnix coturnix in the Alexandria District. Seasonal abundance (assessed as the number of birds flushed per unit effort), sex ratios and reproductive condition (based on gonad sizes) of the quail were measured over a period of 16 months, including two hunting seasons. Hunting impacts were assessed in terms of the number of birds killed per unit of hunting effort. Quail exhibited a spring peak in abundance and reproduction, which coincided with the legal hunting season, and bird numbers varied markedly between years. Sex ratio varied, with males dominating early in spring, Hunters killed nearly 60% of the birds flushed, and hunter efficiency was positively correlated with the abundance of quail. These results confirm the dilemma for managers, as quail are currently hunted during the main breeding season and offtakes are high. The development of management strategies is hampered by a lack of understanding of the population biology and ecology, and impacts of hunting. A number of possible hunting strategies are discussed.

DE environmental consequences; agricultural development; Green Revolution
AB The Green Revolution in India has achieved self-sufficiency in food production. However, in the state of Haryana this has resulted in continuous environmental degradation, particularly of soil, vegetation and water resources. Soil organic matter levels are declining and the use of chemical inputs is intensifying. Newly introduced crop varieties have been responsive to inputs but this has necessitated both increased fertiliser application and use of irrigation resulting in water contamination by nitrate and phosphate and changes in the ground water table. With 82% of the geographic area already under cultivation, the scope for increased productivity lies in further intensification which is crucially dependent on more energy-intensive inputs. Declining nutrient-use efficiency, physical and chemical degradation of soil, and inefficient water use have been limiting crop productivity, whilst the use of monocultures, mechanisation and an excessive reliance on chemical plant protection have reduced crop, plant and animal diversity in recent years. About 60% of the geographical area faces soil degradation (waterlogging, salinity and alkalinity) which threatens the region's food security in the future. Since 1985, the water table has risen more than 1 m annually, and patches of salinity have started to appear at the farm level. The situation is worse in higher rainfall areas where waterlogging follows shortly after the rains. Apart from affecting agricultural crops, a high water table causes floods even following slight rains due to the reduced storage capacity of the soil. Such ecological impacts are motivating farmers to reduce fertiliser and pesticides use. This has led to an increased investment in alternative technology and products including an interest in Integrated Pest Management. The paper discusses major physical, hydrological, chemical and biological constraints relating to soil and water resources for ecosystem sustainability. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Models of agro-ecosystems provide means of prediction beyond the bounds of experience or experimentation. Extrapolation may involve simulation of the expected behaviour for different climate and/or soil conditions, perhaps with alternative management, or for a longer time scale than observed experimentally. The issues to be addressed include those concerned with crop growth and profitability, effects on the soil resource, and consequences for the environment.
   The extent to which the model output is credible depends on how well the model represents those aspects of the system that an important for a particular application. In principle, any model can be enhanced to deal with additional factors, but more complex models become increasingly hungry for inputs, and increasingly difficult to test against actual data. There are judgements to be made as to whether the demands of model building/testing can be justified.
   The choice of what soil constraints should be included in models will depend on what the model is to be used for and the understanding of the processes that the model purports to represent. The dynamics of water and nitrogen are the soil features commonly represented in crop/forest models. Based particularly on experiences with the APSIM modelling framework, the paper reports developments aimed at dealing with erosion, soil structure, salinisation, acidification, and phosphorus as Limitations to plant growth.
   Modelling the consequences of global change on crops and forests involves issues of productivity, climatic variability, "greenhouse" effects and sustainability. Discussion focuses on whether current models need to be enhanced by including other constraints in order to address such issues. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Sustainable use of natural resources continues to gain attention, especially in relation to energy and global carbon cycles. Biomass crops may offset fossil fuels and reduce CO2 contributions to greenhouse gases while improving soil and water quality. We review research on biomass crops, with emphasis on their specific characteristics and how their production can affect soil and water quality. Data from regions throughout the world are included, but the focus is primarily on recent research results from biomass crop production in the United States. Research to date shows promising short-term changes in soil and water quality, but responses vary. Short-term studies have demonstrated increases in surface soil organic-matter content, reduction in erosion and nutrient losses in surface runoff. We conclude that while the potential for benefits is present, data are not yet available to determine the long-term changes in soil quality associated with production of biomass crops.

TI The indigenous bamboo forests of Ethiopia: An overview
SO AMBIO
LA English
DT Article
AB Agricultural land expansion is almost eliminating the bamboo forests of Ethiopia, and the biological diversity associated with them. Several bamboo species are endemic to Africa and mainly found in Ethiopia. Consequently, their preservation is of international concern. Urgent and effective action is required to secure their future existence and for their use in systems managed on a sustainable basis. Utilization driven production could ensure their sustainability. Lack of awareness about their multiple use and a paucity of scientific knowledge about their production and main properties are impediments for conservation and utilization. Concerted efforts are needed to generate and adopt the required knowledge and technology in order to promote bamboo forest cultivation in Ethiopia as an economically viable crop, which is of environmental interest.

AB International peacebuilding can improve the prospects that a civil war will be resolved. Although peacebuilding strategies must be designed to address particular conflicts, broad parameters that fit most conflicts can be identified. Strategies should address the local roots of hostility, the local capacities for change, and the (net) specific degree of international commitment available to assist sustainable peace. One can conceive of these as the three dimensions of a triangle whose area is the "political space"-or effective capacity-for building peace. We test these propositions with an extensive data set of 124 post-World War II civil wars and find that multilateral, United Nations peace operations make a positive difference. UN peacekeeping is positively correlated with democratization processes after civil war and multilateral enforcement operations are usually successful in ending the violence. Our study provides broad guidelines for designing the appropriate peacebuilding strategy, given the mtr of hostility local capacities, and international capacities.

ID SYSTEMS; REGION
AB In China. soil erosion is a serious environmental problem and a major threat to the sustainability of agriculture and economic development. The total area subjected to soil erosion covers 3,670,000 km(2). i.e., 38.2% of the total land area. For a long period of time. particularly since the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949. the Chinese government has paid a great deal of attention to issues of soil and water conservation to promote economic development and better environmental management. This paper reviews soil and water conservation techniques adopted in arid and semi-arid regions of China and discusses the problems and perspectives for soil and water conservation strategies. The effective measures for wind erosion control include vegetative, engineering and chemical methods as well as land management practices, and measures for water erosion include transform topography, tillage and crop rotation management, mulching and rainwater harvesting system. Success in soil and water conservation often requires a combination of various measures, and it needs to be integrated within a comprehensive agricultural management system. In order to gain the potential ecological and economic benefits from soil and water conservation. policy and funding support are also necessary, In addition, further research is needed to assess the ecological, social and economic impacts of soil and water conservation system from a plurality of perspectives.

AB Analysis of secondary data on land use pattern from 1960-61 to 1993-94 suggested that the area under forest, permanent pasture and grazing, and miscellaneous trees and groves should be increased to improve the ecological condition of the region. Cultivation on the land not suitable for it not only threatens sustainability and ecology of the region, but also lowers the agricultural productivity. It is appropriate to use such lands for forestry and pastures development to improve the fertility of the soils.

AB This paper presents a regional engineering model for assessing space heating energies and related greenhouse gas emissions. The objective of the modeling is to improve the quality and quantity of heating energy and emission data, especially for the benefit of local decision making. The model incorporates fuel and energy statistics, building register data, demographic parameters and technical characters of heating into a single framework, allowing explorations of fuel and heat source changes, heating electricity procurement and energy conservation. The case area of the study is the province of North Karelia in Eastern Finland. A model structure, with calibration and evaluation procedures is presented, and extensive municipal estimates of heating energy and related greenhouse gas emission are produced. New indicators characterising the sustainability of heating energy use are introduced. These include municipal per capita estimates of heating energy and emissions as well as the determination of the shares of domestic and renewable energies in space heating.

AB Demographic characteristics of industrially developing countries (IDCs) and some comparisons with industrially advanced countries (IACs), particularly those aspects relevant to ergonomics, are presented. The majority of IDC populations are engaged in subsistence agriculture (the "informal" sector) and consideration is given to the scope for ergonomics interventions, aimed primarily at raising productivity to alleviate the poverty suffered by rural families. Ergonomics issues prevalent in the "formal" sector are also discussed and the importance of finding simple, low-cost solutions through participatory approaches emphasised. The possible contributions of ergonomics to alleviating problems common to both sectors, such as transport, are also indicated and attention is drawn to the difficulties of applying formal standards. The improvement of living and working conditions from incorporating an ergonomics approach into the sustainable livelihoods model, by enhancing human capital, is described in the context of the other livelihood assets. This demonstrates the importance of the cultural dimension for the successful delivery of ergonomics benefits. The application of ergonomics differs between IDCs and IACs particularly through the limited infrastructure in IDCs to support ergonomics activity and interventions. This broaches the different contributions that can be made by ergonomics and occupational health practitioners and implies the need for closer collaboration between these professions.

SO BERICHTE UBER LANDWIRTSCHAFT

ID SOMATOTROPIN
AB Crop biotechnology offers great potentials to contribute to significant increases in global food production in a sustainable way. Still, the economic repercussions of biotechnology for developing countries are largely unknown and have been the subject of acute controversy over the last few years. This study deals with the topic and provides some preliminary empirical results. At first, an analytical framework for the ex ante evaluation of biotechnology products is developed, which is then used within three case studies:
   - banana tissue culture technology in Kenya,
   transgenic sweetpotato virus and weevil resistance technology in Kenya and
   - transgenic potato virus resistance technology in Mexico.
   The case studies underscore that biotechnology offers efficient solutions to a wide range of agronomic problems in developing countries, with concomitant advantages to food producers and consumers. Biotechnological innovations, which help reduce biotic production constraints, are suitable for small- and large-scale farmers alike. Since pest and disease problems are often more severe for smallholders, the benefit potentials are even greater for this group of farmers. Especially transgenic crops can easily be integrated into traditional farming systems because the technology is packaged into the seed and can be reproduced by the farmers themselves. Apart from the technological characteristics, however, institutional aspects also influence the actual socioeconomic outcome. Scenario simulations under different policy assumptions depict how undesired equity effects could be prevented.

AB Natural plant-derived compounds are currently being explored as alternatives for pest control in sustainable agriculture. This study explored the use of two compounds, sesamol and carbenoxolone, in the management of the fungal soybean disease charcoal rot (Macrophomina phaseolina). Previous studies have determined that sesamol and carbenoxolone compounds significantly inhibited fungal pathogen growth and plant disease in vitro. In order to assess the field efficacy of these compounds for fungal disease control, 2 years of field testing of these compounds have been conducted in southeast Kansas. Field treatments of the compounds sesamol and carbenoxolone at three concentrations, 0, 500 and 1000 mug/ml, were applied foliarly at four distinct plant developmental stages. Treatments were applied to plots in random triplicate array and the experiment was repeated during the 1998 and 1999 growing seasons. Disease assessments were based on visual disease ratings, plant mortality and soybean yield analysis. Data were recorded weekly for each treatment plot and statistically analysed using analysis of variance. Results indicate that sesamol and carbenoxolone treatments significantly decreased disease symptoms (11-12%) and plant mortality (24-28%) while significantly increasing soybean yields (18-38%). These results support that plant-derived compounds can have a significant impact on soybean disease management and yield under field conditions.

AB Oil palm is an important economic crop for Malaysia. Genetic engineering could be applied to produce transgenic oil palms with high value-added fatty acids and novel products to ensure the sustainability of the palm oil industry. Establishment of a reliable transformation and regeneration system is essential for genetic engineering. Biolistic was initially chosen as the method for oil palm transformation as it has been the most successful method for monocotyledons to date. Optimization of physical and biological parameters, including testing of promoters and selective agents, was carried out as a prerequisite for stable transformation. This has resulted in the successful transfer of reporter genes into oil palm and the regeneration of transgenic oil palm, thus making it possible to improve the oil palm through genetic engineering. Besides application of the Biolistics method, studies on transformation mediated by Agrobacterium and utilization of the green fluorescent protein gene as a selectable marker gene have been initiated. Upon the development of a reliable transformation system, a number of useful targets are being projected for oil palm improvement. Among these targets are high-oleate and high-stearate oils, and the production of industrial feedstock such as biodegradable plastics. The efforts in oil palm genetic engineering are thus not targeted as commodity palm oil. Due to the long life cycle of the palm and the time taken to regenerate plants in tissue culture, it is envisaged that commercial planting of transgenic palms will not occur any earlier than the year 2020.

AB Because of the relatively well-defined starting date of Venezuela's current economic crisis (early 1983), it provides an ideal model for exploring the effect of worsening economic conditions on biodiversity use. I focus on changing harvest intensities of wood, wildlife and fish, by comparing harvest patterns prior to and after the onset of the economic crisis (pre- and post-1983). Specifically, I analyze figures for (1) wood production, (2) ornamental fish exports, (3) commercial harvests of spectacled caiman (Caiman crocodilus) and (4) capybara (Hydrochaeris hydrochaeris), (5) national and (6) international illegal wildlife trade, and (7) Venezuela's fisheries. I also explore whether current resource use practices appear to be sustainable or not by concentrating on fisheries, as these have abundant data on both the annual per-species catch and the harvest effort. In general, the harvest of wood, wildlife and fish increased sharply after 1983 reaching previously unrecorded levels, growing at a higher rate than the human population. Also, the catch-per-unit effort of many popular fish species in local markets has declined, thus indicating an unsustainable harvest. Although more than one mechanism may explain these results, most of the evidence suggests that contraction of the economy led to increasing unemployment and the workforce shifted to natural resource exploitation as an alternative source of income and food. Regulating the growth of this largely informal and diffuse population of direct resource users will require innovative and creative policies both in Venezuela and other developing countries undergoing similar processes.

DE chloride; landfill; leachate; short rotation coppice; Salix
AB A pot-based experiment was conducted to determine the effect of different chloride concentrations (0-422 mmol l(-1)) on the growth of transplanted saplings of Salix viminalis (clone Q683). Chloride had a very rapid effect on the growth and development of the willow plants and on evapotranspiration (ETa). The degree of reduction in ETa of willows was directly related to chloride concentration and, in the short term, evaporative demand. Sustainable growth and development of willow is unlikely at chloride concentrations greater than 70 mmol l(-1). Further investigations into the management of solute accumulation in the root zone are required in order to develop effective landfill leachate irrigation strategies for trees.

AB The preliminary results of a pilot project on the conditions of pastureland in Tibet are presented. Part I of this paper deals with the particular approach, integrative ecology, and methodology which was developed for this task which demanded relatively rough but fast and reliable results and suggestions for solutions. For that purpose, frequently but imprecisely used terms, such as sustainability, overgrazing, desertification and irreversible, have been defined from the viewpoint of the pastoralists. The evaluation of the pastures was based on a system of simple indicators. The results were:
   1. With this "instant evaluation" it was possible to assess the conditions of pastures and the trend of pasture development.
   2. About one third of the vast pastureland investigated proofed to be in an optimal state, while 50% show signs of overgrazing and even degradation of ancient origin. 20% of overgrazing seemed to be of recent origin. The possible causes of this recent pasture destruction, but also some aspects of the whole complex of "pasture problems" and animal losses will be discussed in part II.

AB Between October 1993 and March 1999, 29 patients with CML who were ineligible for allogeneic BMT underwent PBSC harvest using idarubicin, cytarabine and G-CSF. In 9/29 (31%) patients all collected stem cells were Ph-negative, and 15/29 patients' (52%) collections were substantially (>95%) Ph-negative. The proportion of patients from whom Ph-negative stem cells were obtained was similar between patients who had, or had not, received prior alpha IFN. Fifteen patients in chronic phase (median age 45) proceeded to PBSCT following busulphan 16 mg/m(2) and cyclophosphamide 120 mg/m(2). Nine of the 13 patients who had failed to respond to prior alpha IFN proceeded to stem cell transplantation as soon as was feasible and six of the newly diagnosed patients were transplanted after failing to achieve a cytogenetic response after a minimum of 12 months on alpha IFN following progenitor cell harvest. The median number of days to neutrophils >0.5 and platelet >50 was 18 (range 13-69) and 28 (range 13-234), respectively. There was no procedure-related mortality. At median follow-up of 2.3 years post autograft 10 of 15 patients remain alive and in chronic phase. Overall survival for all 27 patients at 5 years after initial diagnosis is 70% and median survival from diagnosis 7.3 years. Survival for alpha IFN non-responders who were transplanted is 74% at 5 years from diagnosis and 75% at 3 years from transplant. Cytogenetic analysis performed 3 months post transplant demonstrated one patient with a complete cytogenetic response, seven with a partial response and three with no response. Six patients remain partially Ph-negative, with one major CR. Survival for all patients in the protocol is favourable compared with conventional therapy and is particularly encouraging following PBSCT for alpha IFN non-responsive patients. Patients not responding to alpha IFN can be induced into Ph-negativity with PBSCT but this may not always be sustainable. There seems to be no obvious disadvantage in harvesting stem cells after prior exposure to alpha IFN, providing an adequate alpha IFN-free rest period is used.

ID ORGANIZATIONAL ANALYSIS; POSTMODERNISM
AB The institutionalization of R&D by large, modern organizations is regarded as one of the most significant social and economic factors of the twentieth century, In recent years post-modem organizations have begun to replace bureaucratic control with market control, This approach is particularly attractive in the case of R&D employees who have been relatively successful in resisting direct managerial control. Government statistics are used to demonstrate that external R&D increased from 5% to 16% of internal R&D expenditure between 1989 and 1995, This trend is examined in the context of consolidation within the UK pharmaceutical industry, which has consider able implications for the sustainability of high-technology industry in the UK.

ID MODELS
AB The hog/pork industry in Quebec has been going through major institutional changes since 1989, the year an electronic auction was put in place to market all of the hogs in the province. Because the auction's ability to generate high prices did not meet the expectations of hog producers, the pure auction system was replaced by a hybrid one in 1994. In this system, most of the hog supply was pre-attributed to processors ata negotiated price based on the U.S. price while the remainder of the provincial supply of hogs was sold through the auction, In this paper, we investigate how a seemingly inefficient marketing mechanism like pre-attributions can increase the efficiency of a usually efficient mechanism like an auction. We present theoretical arguments regarding the sustainability of collusion under the pure auction and hybrid systems in addition to analyzing auction prices with modern time series tools.

SO CITIES
LA English
DT Article
DE Latin America; Mexico; milk supply; urban agriculture; sustainability
AB This paper examines the use of urban space by dairy production activities in two areas of Mexico City with different degrees of urbanization (east and south). These activities have adapted to the recent urban conditions, from an original rural state. Dairy production is carried out in the house area, and producers pay for urban services as other residents, In the eastern zone, the activity is the sole form of income, while in the south, livelihoods are more diversified. In the east, a wide variety of food wastes from various sources are used, while in the south grass remains an important part of the diet, Raw milk in the east is usually sold direct to the consumer, while intermediaries are more common in the south. Herds tend to be larger and more specialized in the east than the south, In both cases there is important use of local resources both for housing and feeding the animals, Manure is used in pre-Hispanic agricultural systems in sub and peri-urban areas. Based on the range of functions provided to the city by these systems, and the present unnecessary dependence of Mexico City on imported milk, the options for policy and development support are discussed.

ID SOCIAL VULNERABILITY; INCOME INEQUALITY; VIETNAM; HURRICANES; POVERTY;
   HUNGER
AB We discuss approaches to the assessment of vulnerability to climate variability and change and attempt to clarify the relationship between the concepts of vulnerability and adaptation. In search of a robust, policy-relevant framework, we define vulnerability in terms of the capacity of individuals and social groups to respond to, that is, to cope with, recover from or adapt to, any external stress placed on their livelihoods and well-being. The approach that we develop places the social and economic well-being of society at the centre of the analysis, focussing on the socio-economic and institutional constraints that limit the capacity to respond. From this perspective, the vulnerability or security of any group is determined by resource availability and by the entitlement of individuals and groups to call on these resources. We illustrate the application of this approach through the results of field research in coastal Vietnam, highlighting shifting patterns of vulnerability to tropical storm impacts at the household- and community-level in response to the current process of economic renovation and drawing conclusions concerning means of supporting the adaptive response to climate stress. Four priorities for action are identified that would improve the situation of the most exposed members of many communities: poverty reduction; risk-spreading through income diversification; respecting common property management rights; and promoting collective security. A sustainable response, we argue, must also address the underlying causes of social vulnerability, including the inequitable distribution of resources.

AB Populations in agricultural landscapes often occur in source-sink situations: small patches of marginal habitat (sinks) are supported by an immigration flux from larger patches of high-quality habitat (sources). We sought to demonstrate that this situation occurs for Reed Warblers (Acrocephalus scirpaceus) in a riverine, mainly agricultural landscape in the Netherlands. We collected data on occurrence and habitat features in a large number of mostly small marshlands. We used a stochastic model to simulate the population dynamics in a metapopulation with sinks and sources. A statistical analysis of the field data, using regression techniques with occupation probability and abundance index as dependent variables, showed that habitat quality was less favourable in small habitat patches (e.g., ditches with reeds) than in larger patches (large, heterogeneous marshlands). The spatial cohesion of the landscape also played an important role: abundance of breeding Reed Warblers in regions with low spatial cohesion was low. Local extinctions and recolonizations occurred and their rates depended on the spatial parameters of the patch. This supports the hypothesis that metapopulation theory is applicable here. The results of the modeling study demonstrated that, besides the trivial dependence of sinks on sources, a larger amount of sink area and increased exchange of individuals increased the stability of source patches. This was shown not only by the larger size of the source population but also by increased resilience after a catastrophe. The area of the sink seemed less important than its distance to the source. The simulation indicated an optimal area of a few hectares (compared to a 10-ha area of the source) and a maximum distance of 2-5 km from the source. In creating sustainable landscapes, for example, by setting up an ecological network consisting of a limited number of high-quality patches, these small and seemingly insignificant habitat patches could play an important role and should be taken into consideration.

AB Progenics's rCD4-IgG2 (PRO-542) is a recombinant fusion protein, which has been developed using the company's Universal Antiviral Binding (UnAB) technology, and is in phase I/II clinical trials for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1) infection [273391].
   At the beginning of 1997, Progenics received a Phase II Small Business Innovation Research Program (SBIR) grant from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious diseases (NIAID) to fund the development of PRO-542 [236048]. A further grant of $2.7 million was awarded in August 1998 for the clinical evaluation of PRO-542 and other anti-HIV therapies [294200].
   Progenics is collaborating with the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center (ADARC) in New York and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta [178410]. In February 2000, Progenics and Genzyme Transgenics Corp signed an agreement to continue the development of a transgenic source of PRO-542. Genzyme will develop transgenic goats that produce PRO-542 in their milk in exchange for undisclosed fees and milestone payments. Genzyme will supply PRO-542 to Progenics for clinical trials with a possibility for eventual commercial supply [357291]. Following on from this, in October 2000, Progenics received an SBIR grant to fund a two-year project with Genzyme Transgenics into the development of cost-effective methods for the manufacture of PRO-542, by optimization of the production of the drug in the milk of transgenic dairy animals [385982].
   In August 2000, Punk, Ziegel & Company predicted that Progenics Pharmaceuticals will become sustainably profitable in 2003 following the launch of PRO-542 and GMK (Progenics Pharmaceuticals) in 2002 [390063].

AB We develop a matrix model for a harvesting policy that maximizes the harvest of a population without altering its age structure. The model is subsequently applied in harvesting a fish, Tilapia, Oreochromis nilotica population primarily to maximize the stock production. The MATLAB software is employed to generate a stable population structure, which is then subjected to two harvesting strategies from amongst which optimality is thus established.

AB Commercial plantation agroforestry systems have emerged as a promising Amazonian land use with the potential to reduce soil degradation, improve living standards, and decrease pressures on remaining forested areas. While it is generally accepted that tree-based agroecosystems have more closed nutrient cycles that help conserve soil productivity, few studies of nutrient dynamics in Amazonian agroforestry systems exist, making it difficult to assess the extent to which this land use-is sustainable in the region's weathered soils. We quantified net primary productivity (NPP) and the stocks and fluxes of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) over one year in a commercial plantation agroforestry system in Acre, Brazil, to determine how organic matter and N and P dynamics change when native Amazonian forest is converted to perennial crops, and how nutrient cycling in tree-based agroecosystems compares with other Amazonian land uses. We used a participatory approach that involved farmers throughout the research process, with the aim of stimulating a community dialogue on the importance of nutrient cycling dynamics to sustained agricultural production. As part of this process, management recommendations to protect and enhance nutrient cycling in a manner practical for resource-limited households were formulated by farmers during focus group discussions. Construction of a nutrient budget revealed that the system's largest elemental stocks were located in the top 20 cm of soil. By the ninth year following establishment, agroforest productivity was high, with annual NPP approaching 3000 g.m(-2).yr(-1). Approximately 80% of the annual N and P requirements were taken up from soil stocks. Nearly 40% of the annual aboveground P requirement was allocated to reproductive tissues, half of which was removed with the harvest of agroforest products. Removal of P was half as much as would be expected for a first-year annual crop grown in a shifting cultivation system, while N export was similar to that of annual crops. Inputs of N and P to the agroforest were negligible, and resorption of N and P from agroforest leaves was comparable to rates cited for mature forest growing on similarly nutrient-poor soils. Return of P to the soil in litterfall exceeded that reported for mature Amazonian forests, despite similar rates of litter production and N flux, rendering agroforest P-use efficiency considerably lower than that reported for native vegetation growing on equally P-poor soils. Overall, NPP and rates of P cycling in the 8-yr-old agroforest were high relative to Amazonian forests, but low soil contents of total N and extractable P, as well as moderate rates of N and P removal, suggest that this land use will require inputs of both nutrients to sustain system productivity in the future. Discussions with farmers indicated that planting and pruning N-fixing legumes was a feasible way to add N, but the efficient use of scarce inorganic amendments would require further research.

AB Understanding, assessing, and simulating behavior requires knowledge of the precepts that are explicitly or implicitly orienting behavior. Human actors can be viewed as (conscious) self-organizing systems attempting to remain viable in a diverse environment containing other self-organizing systems (other human actors, organisms, ecosystems, etc.), all driven by their own viability (sustainability) interests. These fundamental system interests, or basic orientors, have emerged in response to general environmental properties and are therefore identical across self-organizing systems: existence, effectiveness, freedom of action, security, adaptability, coexistence. Even in simulated actors learning to 'survive' in a difficult environment, the basic orientors emerge in the (simulated) evolutionary process - but different actors may evolve into different 'cultural types' with different orientor emphasis. Since balanced attention to all basic orientors is crucial for viability, the set of orientors can be used to derive indicators that Facilitate comprehensive viability and sustainability assessments. The paper outlines the theoretical approach of 'orientation theory' and its application to the assessment and simulation of sustainable development issues. The formal approach of mapping indicators on basic orientors and assessing sustainability dynamics is illustrated using Worldwatch indicator time series. In an actor simulation this approach is used to successfully guide a small global model onto a sustainable path with high 'quality of life'. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In mainstream economy, behaviour is often formalised following the rational actor-approach. However, in real life the behaviour of people is typified by multidimensional optimisation. To realise this, people engage in cognitive processes such as social comparison, imitation and repetitive behaviour (habits) so as to efficiently use their limited cognitive resources. A multi-agent simulation program is bring developed to study how such micro-level processes affect macro-level outcomes, Sixteen agents are placed in a micro-world, consisting of a lake and a gold mine. Each agent's task is to satisfy its personal needs by fishing and/or mining, whereby they find themselves in a commons dilemma facing the risk of resource depletion. Humo economicus and Homo psychologicus are formalised to study the effects of different cognitive processes on the agents' behaviour. Results show that for the H. psychologicus the transition from a fishing to a mining society is more complete than for the H. economicus. Moreover, introducing diversity in agents' abilities causes the Ii. economicus on the average to decrease its time spent working, whereas for the H. psychologicus we observe an increase in the time spent working. These results confirm that macro-level indicators of sustainability, such as pollution and fish-harvest, are strongly and predictably affected by behavioural processes at the micro-level. It is concluded that the incorporation of a micro-level perspective on human behaviour within integrated models of the environment yields a better understanding and eventual management of the processes involved in environmental degradation.

AB Since the German reunification in 1990, lignite production in the Lusatian mining district has significantly decreased as a result of substantial economic and structural changes. This development coincides with efforts by the government of the stare of Brandenburg to enhance the production of biomass on set-aside arable and mining land for energy transformation purposes. In this context the goal is that a share of 3% of the primary energy consumption should come from biomass. As part of the on-going recultivation activities in the post-mining landscapes, short-rotation tree plantations as a special form of energy forests have recently come into focus. Thus, in 1995 a 2.5 ha short-rotation plantation was established on clayed-sandy, nutrient-poor substrates in the Lusatian mining area Welzow-Sud in order to study the ecological potential of fast-growing tree species under the prevailing site conditions. Even under unfavourable soil conditions with a low N and P supply, above-ground biomass production ranged from 2.5 to 11.7 tons dry matter per hectare. Three-year-old plants of fast growing tree species like poplar, willow, and aspen were marked by low mean N (5.3 mg g(-1)), Cl (113 mug g(-1)), Cl (0.8 mug(-1)) and Pb (0.5 mug g(-1)) contents. Therefore, this material is a most favourable biofuel. For the biomass accumulated within this 3-year period a calorific value of 30 000 MJ ha(-1) a(-1) has been calculated. The ash content of 2.4% allows this material to be used for amelioration purposes. This recycling approach guarantees balanced phosphorus, calcium, and magnesium supply. To maintain adequate site productivity only for nitrogen and potassium, a compensatory fertilization is required. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

ID HUMAN APPROPRIATION
AB The utilization of biomass is an important driving force for the socio-economic appropriation of net primary production (NPP) and thus leads to major disturbances in the natural energy flow of ecosystems. The appropriation of aboveground NPP in Austria amounts from 50 to 51% which is higher than the estimates for global NPP appropriation (25-39%). NPP appropriation is associated with a reduction of the standing crop of ecosystems. It leads to a disturbance of biogeochemical flows (e.g. carbon and nitrogen flows). NPP appropriation could also contribute to biodiversity reduction. These potentially detrimental side-effects can be reduced by increasing the efficiency of biomass use by implementing the strategy of 'cascade utilization'. This strategy proposes optimizing the use of biomass as a raw material and as an energy carrier in an integrated manner. If biomass, that had been previously used for some other purpose, is used for energy generation, it will not contribute to NPP appropriation. The utilization of currently unused biomass residues for energy generation could contribute some 76 PJ in Austria, i.e. 6% of the current primary energy consumption, without increasing NPP appropriation.

AB Tree plantations are an important component of tropical landscapes, providing wood, fuel, and perhaps carbon (C) sequestration. Primary production in wet tropical plantations is typically nutrient limited. In some Hawaiian Eucalyptus plantations, nitrogen (N) limitations to production are alleviated by intercropping N-fixing Albizia trees that may decrease available phosphorus (P). Thus, sustainable productivity and C sequestration may depend on species composition. We measured soil N and P availability and ecosystem N and C sequestration in a 17-yr-old replicated replacement series of Eucalyptus and Albizia in Hawaii. Species composition included pure plots of each species and four proportions of mixtures. Soil N availability increased with the proportion of Albizia in the plot, but soil P availability declined. Aboveground tree C accumulation showed a synergistic response to increasing percentage of Albizia, with the mixed stands having more tree C than pure stands of Eucalyptus or Albizia. In the top 50 cm of soil, total N and C increased linearly with percentage of Albizia. Stands with the highest percentage of Albizia had 230 g/m(2) mole soil N and 2000 g/m(2) more soil C than stands without Albizia. Stable C isotope analyses showed that increased soil C resulted from differences in both tree-derived C and "old" sugarcane-derived C. Deeper soil C (50-100 cm) was a substantial fraction (0.36) of total soil C but did not vary among treatments. Our results demonstrate that tree species effects on nutrient and C dynamics are not as simple as monocultures suggest. Mixed-species afforestation increased tree and soil C accrual over 17 years, and N inputs may increase soil C storage by decreasing decomposition.

AB Comparison of sustainability levels of societies has been difficult, as there is no framework that integrates its three main aspects: environment, economy, and social security. A concept is presented defining five levels of sustainability, characterized by growing awareness of and responsibility for the impacts of our actions in space and time. Examples of indicators comprising an Environmental index, a Social Index, and an Economic Index are given and an overall sustainability index is tentatively calculated for 24 Nations. Differences in sustainability levels are shown, Sweden being the most and Sierra Leone the least sustainable nation.

AB States, districts, and schools are promoting and attempting whole school improvement through the use of externally developed reform designs. This article examines how and why schools adopt reforms and the consequences of those processes for reform implementation and sustainability. Case study data are presented on 22 schools, and three types of reform adoption processes are discussed (a) districts encouraging schools to choose among a set of reforms; (b) districts pushing schools to adopt a particular reform; and (c) principals bringing reform designs to their schools. In no case did the impetus for reform adoption arise among teachers in these schools. Because a hierarchical approach is evident in each of these reform adoption scenarios, data are analyzed in terms of a micropolitical perspective. Findings show that the power relations surrounding reform adoption often thwarted genuine initial buy-in and interest in change among local educators, as well as, in some cases, their subsequent implementation efforts. Educators often also had varying perspectives on how the adoption process occurred, suggesting differences in perspective on the reform itself. Recommendations for how the reform adoption process could be improved are discussed.

AB The association between hominids and birds extends back at least one million years. Birds have been and remain an important resource in many local communities. Historically, the Egyptian husbandry of birds was notably extensive, equivalent to the present utilisation of birds in hunting and domestication, especially in Europe, North America and Asia. The modern complexities of sustainable utilisation are demonstrated with a feasibility study from South Africa that involved the Makuleke community and the Kruger National Park. Harvest and reintroduction were tested for the undeniably sustainable resource of redundant second-hatched chicks of African Hawk-eagle Hieraaetus spilogaster, Milky Eagle-owl Bubo lacteus and Southern Ground Hornbill Bucorvus leadbeateri. The technique is feasible but the economic sustainability remains to be determined. Discussion is also presented on the modern concept of sustainable utilisation, the levels at which it can be practiced and the biological risks involved. The features of birds that affect their utilisation are considered and possible avenues for avian research presented, to enhance our knowledge of birds as potential resources and products. The overall emphasis is that biologists must make a proper evaluation of birds as a potential product, so that objective decisions are possible on whether or not to utilise birds as a sustainable resource.

AB As the world's second largest carbon emitter, China has long been criticised as a 'free-rider' enjoying benefits from other countries' efforts to abate greenhouse gas emissions but not taking due responsibilities of its own. China has been singled out as one of the major targets at the subsequent negotiations after the Kyoto curtain had fallen. By analysing the historical contributions of inter-fuel switching, energy conservation, economic growth and population expansion to China's CO(2) emissions during the period 1980-1997, this article first demonstrates that the above criticism cannot hold its ground. Next, we analyse what the economic effects would be if China's carbon emissions in 2010 were cut by 20 and 30%, respectively, relative to the baseline. We found that China's GNP losses under the two less restrictive carbon limits are in the same range as the often reported estimates for industrialised countries under very restrictive carbon limits. Then the article envisions some efforts and commitments that could be expected from China until its per capita income catches up with the level of middle-developed countries. By emphasising the win-win strategies, these efforts and commitments could be unlikely to severely jeopardise China's economic development and, at the same time, would give the country more leverage at the post-Kyoto climate change negotiations. Finally, the article is concluded with the argument that combating global climate change is in China's interest. It will be beneficial to a more sustainable development of the Chinese economy as well as to the global climate. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

ID POSTWAR
AB The ability to predict how national electricity industries will respond to the challenges of competition and the demand for sustainability requires a good understanding of the nature of technological systems and a workable theory of technology choice. So far, two distinct theoretical perspectives, the economic and socio-political concepts of technological systems, have competed for dominance in policy analysis and policy making. This paper is a comparative study of the way in which the electricity industries of Denmark and France responded to a series of challenges beginning with the 1973 oil crisis and continuing through the present push to liberalise electricity markets. Focussing on the forces that directed technological change in these two nations, I examine the relative importance of economic and socio-political factors. My analysis indicates that socio-political factors which, together, can be described as political traditions have shaped technology choice. The Danish and French electricity industries have pursued several objectives in addition to economic efficiency. This has limited the function of free markets. Thus, they should be understood as political structures whose most important characteristic is the distribution of power. In this context, the economic perspective represents a normative demand for the re-arrangement of political values. Technological choice which radically departs from the status quo implies a significant redistribution of political power and is, therefore, very difficult. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

   perspective
SO ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION

DT Article

   index; environmental change
ID MANAGEMENT; EVOLUTION
AB Sustainable coastal resource management requires the safeguarding and transmission to future generations of a level and quality of natural resources that will provide an ongoing yield of economic and environmental services. All maritime nations are approaching this goal with different issues in mind. The UK, which has a long history of development and flood protection in coastal areas, has chosen to adopt shoreline management, rather than coastal management, so placing coastal defence above all else as its primary and statutory objective. This paper aims to provide a geomorphological perspective of long-term coastal evolution and seeks to compare the UK approach with wider interpretations of coastal management. Based on a literature review, it is argued that coastal management (CM) and shoreline management, as a subset of CM, should share the same ultimate objectives, which are defined by many authorities as sustainable use. The objectives, both strategic and pragmatic, which follow from such an aim may appear to conflict with a reading of many of the texts for international and national CM or designated area management which emphasizes stability rather than sustainability. The result is that coastal defence is seen not merely as a means to an end but as an end in itself. It is argued within this paper that sustainable use of the coast, however, demands both spatial and temporal flexibility of its component systems, and management for change must therefore be the primary objective. Response of the natural system to independent forcing factors must be encouraged under this objective, whether such forces are natural or anthropogenic. In achieving such an objective the concept of shoreline vulnerability may prove useful. A simple and preliminary Vulnerability Index is proposed, relating disturbance event frequency to relaxation time (the time taken for the coastal feature to recover its form). This index provides a first order approximation of the temporal variability that may be expected in landform components of the shoreline system, so allowing management to provide more realistic objectives for long-term sustainability in response to both natural and artificial forces.

TI Rehabilitation of industrial areas: case histories from England and
   Germany
SO ENVIRONMENTAL GEOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE contamination; dereliction; desk studies; foundation remnants;
   rehabilitation; site investigation
AB Contaminated and possibly hazardous ground represents a problem in all of the industrialized countries of the world. The investigation of a site that is suspected of being contaminated differs somewhat from a routine site investigation. Sampling of soils, groundwater and gas-producing material may be required. Various precautions may be necessary in doing this and operatives may have to wear protective clothing. Four case histories have been chosen to illustrate different aspects of the rehabilitation of abandoned contaminated land, namely, investigation, assessment, ground treatment and redevelopment. The Gst comes from Leeds in West Yorkshire, England, and outlines how a site investigation was undertaken and the nature of the contamination present, together with a note on the suggested redevelopment. The remaining three case histories are taken from the heavily industrialized district of the Ruhr in Germany, where extensive mining of coal and associated industries were developed from the mid-19th century onwards. The first considers the site of the former Graf Moltke mine near Essen. In this instance, the somewhat novel methods of data assessment and ground treatment are dealt with. The Mont Cenis site at Herne-Sodingen is one of the more notable old mining/industrial sites undergoing redevelopment in the state of North Rhine Westphalia. Hence, the case history concentrates of this aspect of rehabilitation. This involves not only the construction of new and interesting structures but an attempt to reduce energy consumption in an attempt to effect the concept of sustainable development of an urban area. The last example deals with the abandoned site of the Minister Achenbach mine at Lunen, where the ground conditions were further complicated by the presence of old bomb craters that had been filled with a variety of materials. In addition, because of the suspected presence of former foundation structures in the ground an electromagnetic survey was carried out across part of the site, the areas of high conductivity suggesting their presence.

AB As a result of the Leadership Conference on Biomedical Research and the Environment, the Facilities Committee focused its work on the development of best environmental practices at biomedical research facilities at the university and independent research facility level as well as consideration of potential involvement of for-profit companies and government agencies. The designation "facilities" includes all related buildings and grounds, "green auditing" of buildings and programs, purchasing of furnishings and sources, energy efficiency, and engineering services (lighting, heating, air conditioning), among other activities. The committee made a number of recommendations, including development of a national council for environmental stewardship in biomedical research, development of a system of green auditing of such research facilities, and creation of programs for sustainable building and use. In addition, the committee recommended extension of education and training programs for environmental stewardship, in cooperation with facilities managers, for all research administrators and researchers. These programs would focus especially on graduate fellows and other students, as well as on science labs at levels K-12.

AB The National Association of Physicians for the Environment (NAPE) has assumed a leadership role in protecting environmental health in recent years. The Committee of Biomedical Research Leaders was convened at the recent NAPE Leadership Conference: Biomedical Research and the Environment held on 1-2 November 1999, at the National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland. This report summarizes the discussion of the committee and its recommendations The charge to the committee was to raise and address issues that will promote and sustain environmental health, safety, and energy efficiency within the biomedical community. Leaders from every important research sector (industry laboratories, academic health centers and institutes, hospitals and care facilities, Federal laboratories, and community-based research facilities) were gathered in this committee to discuss issues relevant to promoting environmental health. The conference and this report focus on the themes of environmental stewardship, sustainable development and "best greening practices." Environmental stewardship, an emerging theme within and outside the biomedical community, symbolizes the effort to provide an integrated, synthesized, and concerted effort to protect the health of the environment in both the present and the future. The primary goal established by the committee is to promote environmentally responsible leadership in the biomedical research community. Key outcomes of the committee's discussion and deliberation were a) the need for a central organization to evaluate, promote, and oversee efforts in environmental stewardship; and b) immediate need to facilitate efficient information transfer relevant to protecting the global environment through a database/clearinghouse. Means to fulfill these needs are discussed in this report.

AB The principal themes for the Biomedical Research and the Environment Conference Committee on Environmental Economics in Biomedical Research include the following: healthcare delivery companies and biomedical research organizations, both nonprofit and for-profit, need to improve their environmental performance; suppliers of healthcare products will be called upon to support this need; and improving the environmental profile of healthcare products begins in research and development (R&D). The committee report begins with requirements from regulatory authorities [e.g., U.S. Environmental Protection Agency [EPA], the U.S. Food and Drug Administration), and the healthcare delivery sector). The 1998 American Hospital Association and EPA Memorandum of Understanding to reduce solid waste and mercury from healthcare facilities is emblematic of these requirements. The dominant message from the requirements discussion is to ensure that R&D organizations do not ignore customer, environmental, and regulatory requirements in the early stages of product development. Several representatives from healthcare products manufacturers presented their companies' approaches to meeting these requirements. They reported on efforts to ensure that their R&D processes are sensitive to the environmental consequences from manufacturing, distributing, using, and disposing of healthcare products. These reports describe representatives' awareness of requirements and the unique approaches their R&D organizations have taken to meet these requirements. All representatives reported that their R&D organizations have embraced environmental product design because it avoids the potential of returning products to R&D to improve the environmental profile. Additionally, several reports detailed cost savings, sustainability benefits, and improvements in environmental manufacturing or redesign, and increased customer satisfaction. Many companies in healthcare delivery are working to improve environmental performance. Fundamental to these efforts is the necessity of motivating suppliers to improve the environmental profile of new products used in the healthcare delivery sector.

AB Providing clean water at relevant quality and quantity is a challenge that regulatory authorities have to face in metropolitan cities that seem to develop at their limits of sustainability. Istanbul strives to face such a challenge for its population of over 10 million, through six surface water resources. Two approaches of classification for the reservoirs are presented, one based on current regulations and an alternative based on a more detailed classification. The results have shown that nutrient control is the primary issue, and one of the reservoirs has already exceeded the limits of being eutrophic, one is at mesotrophic conditions, and the remaining four are at the limit of being eutrophic, indicating the significance of making the correct decision and taking pertinent measures for management and control. It has been observed that the only mesotrophic resource, which also has the best general quality class, has no industry and a very low population density, whereas the one that is already eutrophic is also the one with the lowest quality class, has the highest population density, and has the greatest percentage of urban land use within its watershed.

DE sustainable forest management; criteria and indicators; analytic
   hierarchy process; multiple criteria analysis
AB This paper describes an application of multiple criteria analysis (MCA) in assessing criteria and indicators adapted for a particular forest management unit. The methods include: ranking, rating, and pairwise comparisons. These methods were used in a participatory decision-making environment where a team representing various stakeholders and professionals used their expert opinions and judgements in assessing different criteria and indicators (C&I) on the one hand, and how suitable and applicable they are to a forest management unit on the other. A forest concession located in Kalimantan, Indonesia, was used as the site for the case study. Results from the study show that the multicriteria methods are effective tools that can be used as structured decision aids to evaluate, prioritize, and select sets of C&I for a particular forest management unit. Ranking and rating approaches can be used as a screening tool to develop an initial list of CBI. Pairwise comparison, on the other hand, can be used as a finer filter to further reduce the list. In addition to using these three MCA methods, the study also examines two commonly used group decision-making techniques, the Delphi method and the nominal group technique. Feedback received from the participants indicates that the methods are transparent, easy to implement, and provide a convenient environment for participatory decision-making.

TI Sustainability: Waste minimization, green chemistry and inherently safer

SO ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRESS
LA English
DT Article
ID CHEMICALS; CATALYSIS
AB Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary defines sustainable as "maintain, or cause to continue, in existence or a certain state." The word "sustainable" is now used to define a world that is able to "maintain in existence" all life that now exists. To attain that goal, human activities will need to change. Waste Minimization, Green Chemistry and Inherently Safer Processes all seek to manufacture chemicals in an environmentally sustainable way by reducing waste generation, minimizing the impact of chemicals and chemical processes on the environment and the public, and minimizing any hazards to the workers. In this paper, we discuss the synergies among these concepts. The three disciplines must better coordinate their efforts to capitalize on the total teachings, develop and retrofit manufacturing processes using the best technologies, and ensure the highest return projects. In the end, the ultimate chemical process will produce a non-toxic, recyclable or easily biodegradable product that meets society's needs produces no waste, is inherently safer, and uses renewable feed materials.

DE sustainable development; urban management; Recife Metropolitan Area
AB The objective of this work is to apply the concept of sustainable urban development to a real case of metropolitan development planning in a developing country. The ideas of integrated conservation are used as the framework for the formulation of strategies and action polices for the management of the metropolis. The paper explores the concepts of conservation and areas of transformation as well those of service networks and information. The work tries to present general concepts for new urban planning initiatives. However, it has a strong practical sense because it is based on the real application of the new concepts on the formulation of the Development Plan of the Recife Metropolitan Area.

DT Article
DE urban policies; urban impacts; urban geography
AB The authors argue that the results of the post-1973 market-oriented urban policies in Santiago have been strongly conditioned by the "geographical resonance," or spatial imprint, of the earlier state interventionism, as well as by the "border spaces" product of urban development between. the city's poor areas and today's expanding modem neighborhoods and commercial areas. Urban policies have no simple or direct impact on the city as implied nowadays by the popular approach of "territorial impacts" of capitalist restructuring and globalization, or in the project or policy assessment methodology, that is part of the private and public forms of urban management. Geographical resonances and border spaces could even further paradoxical results, some of which are discussed in the article. The attention paid to these spatial complexities could provide better assessment of urban management initiatives and of the peculiarities of each city.

AB This paper proposes a signaling model that offers a new perspective on why governments deviate from optimal tax smoothing and delay debt stabilization. In our model, dependable - but not fully credible - governments have an incentive to tighten the fiscal regime when the signaling effect on credit ratings is larger (that is, when a sufficiently large stock of debt has been accumulated). At this point, they may deviate from tax smoothing not to be mimicked by weak governments. We show that a testable prediction of our model is that primary balances and debt stocks are complementary inputs in the credit rating function and we successfully test it on Italian, Irish, Belgian, and Danish data.

AB In semi-arid northern Tanzania, the native woodland is being rapidly cleared and replaced by low input agriculture. This has resulted in pronounced environmental degradation, and in particular loss of phosphorus (P) from the soil. We have used sequential extraction and P-31-NMR to investigate the effects of land use changes, i.e. native woodland, degraded woodland, cultivation for 3 and 15 years and homestead fields where manure was applied, on the amount and structural composition of P in this soil. Clearing and continuous cultivation reduced both organic and inorganic P in the soil. The difference in the amount of organic P from the bulk soil of the fields cultivated for 3 and 15 years was not statistically significant (P < 0.05), suggesting that most of the depletion in organic P occurred during the first 3 years of cultivation. By contrast, in the homesteads, there was much organic and inorganic P in the soil. The P-31-NMR revealed that cultivation resulted in a 53% depletion of orthophosphate diester P, whereas only a 30% and 39% reduction of orthophosphate monoester P was found in the bulk soil after 3 and 15 years of cultivation, respectively. These results concur with the suggestion that diester P constitutes more easily mineralizable forms of organic P in soil than does monoester P. Our P-31-NMR also showed that 70% of the inorganic orthophosphate P was depleted from the coarse and fine sand separates as a result of cultivation. The influence of clearing and subsequent cropping on the amount and forms of P was more pronounced in the coarse and fine sand than in the silt and clay, stressing the importance of particle size and chemical properties such as organic matter and oxides in the availability of P in this soil. Our results show that the current low input agricultural practice is not sustainable, and that practices must be developed to combat the ongoing degradation of the soil. A combined use of available organic materials such as animal manure with the judicious use of inorganic fertilizers can replenish the soil's fertility.

AB Recent advances in research on best practices for educating students with disabilities have improved the knowledge base about these practices. However, there remains a significant gap between the knowledge we have about these best practices, and the extent to which it has been implemented. Two common and simple explanations for this complex problem, "blame the teacher" and "blame the researcher," are both inadequate to explain this gap. Sustainability grants are designed to help understand linkages between research and practice, so that the knowledge about effective practices might be better represented and implemented in classrooms. Some facilitators for sustainability are the ability of teachers to give input along the way; and a feeling of collaboration, sensitivity, and responsiveness between the researcher and the practitioner. Issues related to the extent to which sustainability can reasonably be expected over time are presented.

TI Uncertainty and precautionary management of marine fisheries: Can the
   old methods fit the new mandates?
SO FISHERIES
LA English
DT Article
ID DIVERSITY
AB Continued stock declines in marine fisheries have resulted in a search for more risk-averse management approaches. In response, the Sustainable Fisheries Act of 1996 mandates habitat protection, bs catch reduction, and stock rebuilding. These changes emphasize precaution, and imply a shift in focus from maximizing yields to minimizing ecological impacts and maintaining long-term biological and economic sustainability: Unfortunately: there is little consensus on how a precautionary approach should be applied in managing overcapitalized marine fisheries, especially considering the substantial uncertainty in our understanding of ecosystem structure and function, and the effects of fishing. Speakers in a half-day symposium at the 1999 AFS Annual Meeting discussed a spectrum of: topics relating to analytic and decision-making uncertainty, precautionary management approaches, the social and political context in which decisions must be reached and the role of management decisions in creating incentives. New approaches within the current decision-making context show some promise for reducing uncertainty and becoming more risk-averse. However, past lessons force us to conclude that the old methods will not satisfy the new mandates for risk-averse management approaches that are robust to both uncertainty regarding the effects of fishing on the ecosystem, and uncertainty regarding the effects of regulations on those being regulated. This paper is a synthesis of the diverse views of nine symposium participants. Speakers and the titles of their payers are shown in the acknowledgments.

ID AMERICAN-FISHERIES-SOCIETY
AB Sustainability is widely recognized as the capacity of an area to meet the needs of the present generation without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. Humans ultimately depend on natural ecosystems to meet most of their basic needs. However, compelling scientific evidence indicates that ecological and societal health is threatened worldwide, especially aquatic ecosystems. Our population densities, consumption, and technology are among the pervasive pressures connecting and affecting sustainability at every level. These complexities are also overwhelming most local decision-makers capacity to assess such problems or respond with effective solutions. To address these challenges, many agencies and organizations are pursuing the goal of sustainability through more ecologically and socially inclusive "ecosystem-based managment" approaches. These approaches generally encompass the broad domains of environment, society, and related institutions. Numerous conceptual frameworks and hundreds of indicators are being proposed to quantify and simplify these more comprehensive methods. However, none of the frameworks bring together a universal, but relatively small, set of components needed to ensure the integrity of all ecosystems, societies, and decision-making processes-at all levels. This paper attempts to provide such a framework. To do this, widely accepted principles from ecology, human health, and management science were identified and integrated into a single, operational framework to help manage for sustainability. The flexible framework includes 13 core components believed necessary for "integrity": ecosystem diversity, productivity, chemical cycling, and disturbance; societies that provide for physiological needs, safety 'security, love and belonging, self-esteem, and self-actualization; and decision-making processes and institutions that are results-oriented, truth-seeking, consent-based, and adaptable. Also presented are: (1) candidate indicators from global, national, and local efforts, (2) important indicator selection criteria, (3) "amoeba plots" to diagnose and illustrate sustainability; (4) an adaptive management cycle using indicators; and (5) recommendations to expedite sustainability indicator development and use The consummate role of human conscience in achieving sustainability is emphasized.

AB Salmonid recreational fisheries in Argentina are becoming economically important. However, studies that may help ensure the sustainability and development of the resource are lacking. Official management organizations see fishermen as a homogeneous group with rather simple resource use requirements. On the contrary, preliminary data indicate that they are a heterogeneous assemblage of people with differing interests in settings and complex motivations. This paper studies the different human groups that constitute the fishermen population in the area of San Carlos de Bariloche in Rio Negro province. Responses to 420 questionnaires and interviews were analyzed for distribution of age, sex, trip objectives, place of residence, trip duration, years of experience, number of fishing trips per season and preferences. Multivariate procedures, multiple factorial analysis and cluster analysis were used to identify and study different fishermen groups. Identified groups are complex and diverse with overlapping boundaries. The fact that Patagonia has a unique diversity with regard to water bodies where salmonids thrive allows for special regulations that could take into account the complexities of the human component, thus promoting management oriented towards the different human groups that use the resource.

AB This paper attempts to provide insights into poverty, food insecurity, and malnutrition in Central Asia in the period following independence, and presents the available evidence from household-level data in the Kyrgyz Republic. It finds that although some improvement has been made in recent years, significant levels of poverty, food insecurity, and child malnutrition still exist. The paper argues that, in the short run, efforts should be made to protect vulnerable groups by investing in information generation and building capacity to design and implement food security and nutrition policies and programs. Increasing the speed of policy reforms and investment in productivity-enhancing agricultural research and rural infrastructure are fundamental for long-tem sustainable development in Central Asia.

AB After the breakup of the Soviet Union, the republics of Central Asia began to restructure their agricultural sectors to achieve food security and to adjust to the requirements of a market economy. Although they encountered many common challenges, their agricultural policies differed significantly. For this reason, it is important to see the results of these policies and to learn lessons from them. This paper discusses the role of and the challenges facing rangelands and livestock production systems in achieving food security among the pastoral communities of Central Asia. It analyzes the trends in Livestock development during the economic transition in Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, and Uzbekistan, and derives policy directions for the sustainable use of rangelands and for the growth of the livestock sector in Central Asia.

AB Given the present conditions of demographic growth and the complicated transition toward market economies in Central Asia, the problems of food security and designing policies to achieve it without compromising economic growth are at the forefront of policy agendas in these countries. This paper reviews food policy reforms in Uzbekistan, the Kyrgyz Republic, and Tajikistan in the context of sustainable agricultural development. Analyzing the trends in the agricultural sector during the transition period, it identifies the major impacts of policy reforms on food security and enumerates future challenges for improving food security in these countries. It finds that despite the progress made in reforming their economies toward market-oriented ones, the three countries continue to face food insecurity to varying degrees. It concludes that there is an urgent need to further expand and deepen the reform process by enabling functioning land, labor, and financial markets. (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

DT Article
DE Botswana; participation; conservation; community-based natural resource

ID DYNAMICS; KALAHARI
AB This paper examines the complexities of participatory conservation through a case study of the process of participation in a government funded community-based natural resource management programme in Western Botswana. The paper argues that different stakeholders have very different views on the levels of participation taking place in particular projects. Furthermore local people find it difficult to voice their concerns about the environment and issues of sustainability given the power relations involved in this 'participatory' process. The paper questions the accountability and motivation of the different stakeholders involved in participatory projects and suggests that implicit in the policy implementation process are mechanisms which constrain empowerment and dictate the forms of participatory conservation which can emerge. The paper concludes by reviewing the case study in the light of new policy developments in Botswana.

AB Forest management is an important carbon mitigation strategy for developing countries. As demonstrated by the case of Mexico, community forest management is especially effective because it offers tangible local benefits while conserving forests and sequestering carbon. Community forestry receives minimal government support now, but the clean development mechanism (CDM) of the Kyoto Protocol could leverage additional resources to promote the approach in Mexico and elsewhere. We argue that adequately designed and implemented, community forestry management projects can avoid deforestation and restore forest cover and forest density. They comprise promising options for providing both carbon mitigation and sustainable rural development. These kinds of projects should be included in the CDM. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Recently, a sustainable development action plan was prepared for the city of Semarang, Indonesia. An essential component of this action plan was the building up of an effective partnership among the diverse stakeholders to ensure their commitment. Such an approach in which the city's stakeholders are actively involved in decision making was new for Semarang. This paper describes the roles and attitudes of the different stakeholders in the development of the action plan, and the complex and difficult process to forge partnerships between them. The paper explores the constraints faced during this participatory process, and suggests that there is a need to build the capacity of all stakeholders involved - local government, civil society and the private sector - so that they will be able to play their envisaged respective roles better.

TI The historical development of the Mexico City milk supply system: local
   and global contradictions

ID CITIES
AB In order to help inform interventions in food supply systems, urban areas, and sustainable development, this paper traces the development of the milk supply system to Mexico City. The co-evolution of urban supply and demand factors with policy objectives is dealt with in three distinct periods. (1) The early 20th century in which milk production became an end in itself of cattle raising, with the introduction of new forage crops and the concept of the 'dairy basin'. (2) The period of the paternalist state is characterised by policy objectives to support Mexican dairy producers and ensure milk supply to the burgeoning urban population. To these ends, there was increasing government intervention in cattle breeding and production systems, distribution and processing of milk, and the importation of powdered milk from international stocks. (3) The neoliberal period included a retreat of the state from quality control enforcement, the inclusion of imported milk the industrialisation process of products for national sale, and concentration of dairy enterprises into fewer hands. While ealier policy objectives have indeed been achieved, three contradictions pose a threat to the systems sustainability: the disarticulation of national supply and demand by means of the financial attractiveness of imported milk stocks; the now minimal contribution of the urban area to its own milk consumption, and the poor quality of industrialised milk products reaching the consumer. It is expected that the system will persist essentially unchanged in the near future, as the various actors involved each act in their own self-interest. Constructive interventions should focus on the contradictions created by the pursual of previous policy approaches, and necessarily address issues of sustainability at various scales.

TI Stakeholders' partnership approach to infrastructure provision and
   management in developing world cities: lessons from the Sustainable
   Ibadan project
SO HABITAT INTERNATIONAL
LA English

DE sustainable human settlements; infrastructure; urban environment;
   stakeholder partnerships
AB In recent decades unprecedented urbanization has constituted a huge challenge to urban infrastructure development and management in most developing countries. Meanwhile, the appropriateness of conventional urban planning approaches to the improvement of urban environmental conditions in the face of deteriorating urban environment have often been questioned. It became inevitable to search for new approaches particularly in the context of low-income urban communities. International organizations such as the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the United Nations Centre for Human Settlements (UNCHS) have subsequently initiated strategies to evolve a participatory approach to the development and management of the urban environment. One of such strategies is the Sustainable City Programme (SCP) which aims to provide municipal authorities and city stakeholders in the public, private and community sectors with an enhanced capacity for environmental planning and management. The programme is being implemented in several cities in parts of the developing world, including Ibadan - the Sustainable Ibadan Project (SIP) - in Nigeria. This paper examines the partnership approach to urban environmental infrastructure improvement, development and management as represented by the SIP. The relevance of the participatory partnership approach of the SIP for cities in parts of developing regions is examined. The paper implicitly stresses that bottom-up participatory stakeholder partnership is a strategy capable of enlisting the financial, material resources and expertise of various sectors of the urban community towards the improvement of urban environmental infrastructure. The paper presents preliminary findings of a study. Although traditional appraisal techniques were not employed, nonetheless, the paper presents a discussion of the processes and dynamics of the SIP on the basis of which some useful lessons may be drawn.

AB One of the key public health challenges facing indigenous and other minority communities is how to develop and implement effective, acceptable, and sustainable strategies for the prevention of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). In this article, the authors describe how an ethnographic approach was used to contextualize the behavioral risk factors for NIDDM and applied to the development of a more meaningful and appropriate epidemiological risk factor survey instrument for an urban Aboriginal population in Australia. The overall research design comprised a mixture of qualitative and quantitative methods. The ethnographic study showed that the complex web of meanings that tie people to their family and community can and should be taken into account in any social epidemiology of health and illness if the findings are to have any effective and long-term potential to contribute to successful public health interventions targeting these behavioral risk factors.

AB Sustainable practices are needed in vegetable production to maintain yield and to reduce the potential for soil erosion and N leaching. We examined the effects of tillage [no-till (NT), chisel plowing (CP), and moldboard plowing (MP)], cover cropping [hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Both) vs. winter weeds], N fertilization (0, 90, and 180 kg.ha(-1) N), and date of sampling on tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) yield, N uptake, and soil inorganic N in a Norfolk sandy loam in Fort Valley, Ga. for 2 years. Yield was greater with CP and MP than with NT in 1996 and was greater with 90 and 180 than with 0 kg.ha(-1) N in 1996 and 1997. Similarly, aboveground tomato biomass (dry weight of stems + leaves + fruits) and N uptake were greater with CP and MP than with NT from 40 to 118 days after transplanting (DAT) in 1996; greater with hairy vetch than with winter weeds at 82 DAT in 1997; and greater with 90 or 180 than with 0 kg.ha(-1) N at 97 DAT in 1996 and at 82 DAT in 1997. Soil inorganic N was greater with NT or CP than with MP at 0- to 10-cm depth at 0 and 30 DAT in 1996; greater with hairy vetch than with winter weeds at 0- to 10-cm and at 10- to 30-cm at 0 DAT in 1996 and 1997, respectively; and greater with 90 or 180 than with 0 kg.ha(-1) N from 30 to 116 DAT in 1996 and 1997. Levels of soil inorganic N and tomato N uptake indicated that N release from cover crop residues was synchronized with N need by tomato, and that N fertilization should be done within 8 weeks of transplanting. Similar tomato yield, biomass, and N uptake with CP vs. MP and with 90 vs. 180 kg.ha(-1) N suggests that minimum tillage, such as CP, and 90 kg.ha(-1) N can better sustain tomato yield and reduce potentials for soil erosion and N leaching than can conventional tillage, such as MP, and 180 kg.ha(-1) N, respectively. Because of increased vegetative cover in the winter, followed by increased mulch and soil N in the summer, hairy vetch can reduce the potential for soil erosion and the amount of N fertilization required for tomato better than can winter weeds.

AB Conflicts arise between subsistence hunters and those who wish to conserve the animals they hunt. Solutions require measures of sustainability. Data are presented on the sustainability for the Wana hunters living in the highlands of Central Sulawesi, Indonesia. Pigs (Sus celebensis) and dwarf buffalo (Bubalus spp.) account for 58 percent and 40 percent of the large game harvest by weight. Primates (Macaca tonkeana) are occasionally killed. Data suggest pig hunting is sustainable, primates may have been overhunted in the past, and that dwarf buffalo are vulnerable. Using GPS, the area encompassing all of fields, traps, and house locations for the sample of 153 Wana was measured to be only 18.1 km(2). To sustain their current harvest of pigs, however, the Wana need access to at least 290km(2) of catchment. Their harvest of 0.30 pigs per person per year can be sustained if the Wana population density is no greater than 0.53 persons per km(2). Pigs are the most sustainable of the Wana's prey options. Removing primates from the Wana's diet would have a negligible nutritional effect. Persuading Wana hunters not to pursue dwarf buffalo will be the most difficult challenge for Morowali's managers.

DE Nigeria wetland; groundwater/surface-water relations; ecosystem
   protection
AB The hydrologic and water-quality characteristics of a small tropical riverine wetland at Ulakwo, near Owerri, Imo State, Nigeria, were evaluated by analysis of stream hydrographs, the groundwater flow system, and geochemical analyses. This research is an initial step toward providing information needed to develop a programme of sustainable development of the ecosystem. The wetland is underlain by a layer of organic debris and hydromorphic soils, which in turn are underlain by an unconfined alluvial sand aquifer about 80 m thick. Horizontal and upward vertical hydraulic head gradients of about 0.002 and 0.001, respectively, and the results of a flow-net analysis suggest that considerable amounts of groundwater flow into the wetland.
   Low concentrations of Fe, NO3, PO4, and SO4 in the wetland water column are probably due to shortterm removal of these nutrients from the surface-water by adsorption on the surficial wetland organic matter and bottom sediments. The groundwater flow system is important in the maintenance of the wetland, which probably plays an important role in the flow stabilisation and improvement of the water quality of the river.

   Internet services and implications for network interconnections
SO IEEE JOURNAL ON SELECTED AREAS IN COMMUNICATIONS
LA English
DT Article
DE capacity provisioning; differentiated service; network interconnection;
   peering stability; second price auction
AB This paper presents a decentralized auction-based approach to pricing of edge-allocated bandwidth in a differentiated services Internet, The players in our network economy model are one raw-capacity seller per network, one broker per service per network, and users, to play the roles of whole-sellers, retailers, and end-buyers, respectively, in a two-tier wholeseller/retailer market, which is best interpreted as a "sender-pay" model. With the progressive second price auction mechanism as the basic building block, we conduct a game theoretic analysis, deriving optimal strategies for buyers and brokers, and show the existence of networkwide market equilibria,
   In addition to pricing, another key consideration in building differentiated network services is the feasibility of maintaining stable and consistent service level agreements across multiple networks where demand-driven dynamic allocations are made only at the edges. Based on the proposed game-theoretic model, we are able to construct an explicit necessary and sufficient condition for the stability of the game, which determines the sustainability of any set of service level agreement configurations between Internet service providers.
   These analytical results are validated with simulations of user and broker dynamics, using the distributed progressive second price auction as the spot market mechanism in a scenario with three interconnected networks, and two services based on the proposed standard expedited forwarding and assured Forwarding per-hop behaviors.

AB The key to sustainable technology is achieving an economic benefit for environmental improvements. The tunability of benign compounds such as CO2 and water as supercritical and near-critical fluids offers improved performance and greater flexibility for separation and reaction processes, leading to economic advantages. Examples of such behavior are supercritical CO2 extractions and separations, CO2-expanded polar liquids for separations, and reactions in near-critical water. In each case the tunability is achieved through density changes or cosolvents and may augment product yield, quality, or rates.

AB Research conducted in the 1990s has demonstrated that one can design compounds which are "CO2-philic", that is, they exhibit miscibility with CO2 at pressures significantly below that of conventional alkyl-functional analogues. The use of such CO2-philic functional groups in the design of surfactants and chelating agents has allowed successful implementation of CO2 in processes such as emulsion polymerization, heavy metal extraction, and others. However, the high cost of widely used fluorinated CO2-philes can render the economics of a CO2 process unfavorable. Consequently, we have investigated the design of CO2-philes composed of only carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. Using fundamental data on the thermophysical behavior of CO2, as a guide, we focused on the design and synthesis of functionalized polyethers and copolymers of cyclic ethers and carbon dioxide that were found to be soluble in liquid and supercritical carbon dioxide. By choosing the proper amount of incorporated carbon dioxide, we can generate propylene oxide-CO2 copolymers that exhibit lower miscibility pressures than fluoroethers with the same number of repeat units.

TI Knowledge and traditional uses of animal resources by an Afro-Brazilian
   community. Preliminary results
SO INTERCIENCIA
LA Portuguese
DT Article
AB Traditional biological knowledge has called the attention of researchers due to the significance that indigenous techniques and knowledge has in areas such as environmental assessment, resources management and sustainable development. Human populations that live in ol around Conservation Units constitute an essential component of the landscape, and their activities are of great value for the conservation arid sustained use of the natural resources in the long term. This article discusses both the knowledge and traditional uses of animal resources by the dwellers of Remanso, in the Chapada Diamantina National Park, Bahia, Brazil, inhabited by approximately 350 Afro-Brazilians. The community is essentially poor and their members make their living by planting maize, bean, and manioc.
   Traditional zoological knowledge concerning the reproductive behavior, trophic ecology, and medicinal and trophic uses has been obtained through open interviews with 13 informants, both male and female, chosen according to indications of the insiders. The consistence of ethnozoological knowledge was observed through comparative cognition tables; where native information was compared with that from the scientific literature. Animal species were identified by comparing folk descriptions with those in the pertinent literature as well as through photographs.
   Folk knowledge regarding animals' reproductive and social behavior, and their food ecology is very consistent with that which is found in scientific literature. Such knowledge should be taken into account when conservation measures are to be defined and in management planning for the Marimbus/Iraquara protection area. Animals are gathered as pet, food, medicines, and income.
   This survey was not only conducted to record the traditional knowledge of native fauna, but to contribute to the understanding of the biology of local animal species and to the profit generation by the community. The suitable management of space and natural resources, as well as the respect for traditional knowledge would permit the maintenance of the environment quality and, thus, the conservation of both natural and cultural resources for the use of both present and forthcoming generations.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND WORLD ECOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE hierarchy theory; human ecology; sustainability
AB Human ecology, it is argued, even when embracing recent developments in the natural sciences and granting a place to culture, tends to excessively pessimistic conclusions about the prospects for creating a sustainable world order. This is illustrated through a study of the work and assumptions of Richard Newbold Adams and Stephen Bunker. It is argued that embracing hierarchy theory, elaborated by Howard Pattee, T.F.H. Alien and others, enables human ecology to conceive humans both as part of nature and as cultural beings in a way that gives due regard to the ethical development of humanity. That is, ethical constraints need no longer be conceived of as 'unnatural'. Characterizing the nature of such constraints, which it is claimed emerge from 'the struggle for recognition', this argument is shown to justify some optimism about the future, and to give some idea of how society should be organized if ethical constraints, able to constrain humanity's relationship to the rest, of nature, are to prevail.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND WORLD ECOLOGY

DE sustainability; socio-ecological principles; system conditions;
   strategic planning; backcasting; the Natural Step
ID SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; ECONOMICS
AB Backcasting is a planning methodology that is particularly helpful when problems at hand are complex and when present trends are part of the problems. When applied in planning towards sustainability, backcasting can increase the likelihood of handling the ecologically complex issues in a systematic and coordinated way, and also to foresee certain changes, even from a self-beneficial point of view, of the market and increase the chances of a relatively strong economic performance. To that end, backcasting should be performed from a set of non-overlapping principles that are general enough to be helpful in the coordination of different sectors of society and in business, as well as to cover relevant aspects of sustainability. Such principles are helpful when developing reliable non-overlapping indicators for monitoring of the development when coordinating various measures from different sectors of the society or within individual firms with each other, and when handling trade-offs in a relevant way. Furthermore, the transition can benefit from being undertaken in a strategic step-by-step manner, by which such investments search for those that combine two qualities: (i) technical flexibility to serve as platforms for future investments in line with non-overlapping principles of sustainability, and (ii) good possibilities of giving relatively fast return on investment. This framework for planning is developed together with the Natural Step, a nongovernment organization, and in collaboration with a network of scientists and business. Examples are given from firms applying the framework.

AB Agricultural systems have become increasingly industrialized and mechanized, relying on machinery and chemical inputs, rather than people and natural processes, to increase yields of food. The trend towards an increasingly globalised food system encourages unsustainable transportation of food around the world. Agricultural intensification and the globalisation of the agrofood chain has resulted in adverse environmental, social and economic consequences impeding moves towards sustainability. Organic farming can overcome many of the environmental problems associated with agricultural intensification. However, it does not have the potential to fully address the social and economic problems caused by the globalisation of the food system. Organic farming must be combined with local and regional sourcing of food products, for instance through forms of direct marketing of organic produce. Direct marketing schemes such as farmers' markets, food box delivery schemes and community-supported agriculture are all projects which, if managed with sustainability as the prime objective, have the potential to move towards a more socially, environmentally and economically sustainable agrofood system.

ID TOURISM
AB The fascination for mountains, breathtaking natural beauty, rich cultural diversity, socioeconomic traditions, history and lifestyles attract mountaineers, trekkers, naturalists ascetics, explorers and cultural tourists from all over the world to the Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve (NDBR) and adjoining areas. Expedition/mountaineering and tourism, as a livelihood option for the people living in the buffer zone areas of NDBR, was important, next to animal husbandry and agriculture. Until 1960, Bhotiya people in the buffer zone of NDBR and adjoining areas had a good trade relationship with Tibet. Closure of Indo-Tibetan trade due to the Indo-China war of 1962, followed by imposition of conservation policies due to creation of Nanda Devi National Park in 1982 and Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve in 1988, caused all consumptive uses and expedition/mountaineering to be banned in the core zone, which has not only affected the local economy to a large extent but also created conflict between local people and reserve authorities. The ban on tourism is the most severe concern of the local people as it provided significant income. Of the three complementary functions of a biosphere reserve, viz. conservation, development and logistic support (research and education), the management is biased towards achieving conservation by legal protection which may not be sustainable in the long term. People have started raising a voice against the ban on expedition/tourism in the core zone but have not yet damaged the core zone area. This paper deals with the history of expeditions and the impact on the local economy, identification of model ecotrekking/expedition routes and potential sites, and designing appropriate strategies/action plans for sustainable ecotourism. This will not only help to resolve the local people-policy conflicts and improve the local economy but will also help to achieve the biodiversity conservation goal.

ID COASTAL RESOURCE-MANAGEMENT; ORGANIZATIONS
AB This study, conducted from November 1995 to February 1996, describes the evolution and impact of fisheries co-management arrangements in a coral reef fishing village at Malalison Island, central Philippines. The island is the site of a community-based fishery resources management project of the Southeast Asian Fisheries Development Center Aquaculture Department, funded by the International Development Research Centre of Canada.
   Using a case study approach and inferential statistics in the analysis of data, the comanagement arrangements on the island are perceived to be successful based on equity, efficiency and sustainability criteria. Fishers, represented by the Fishermen's Association of Malalison Island (FAMI) who form the core group, participated actively in the management of fishery resources with legal and financial support both from the municipal and barangay (village) government. Potential problems nonetheless, still exist with the ambivalent attitude of fishers toward rule-breaking, especially of fishery rules directly affecting them. The future of co-management arrangements will largely depend on how the fishers and other stakeholders maintain and build earlier initiatives with the eventual phasing out of SEAFDEC AQD from the island. The rapid population growth could also affect project gains.

AB Recognizing the limitations common to both centralized and privatized management regimes, institutionalized resource management is beginning to incorporate the knowledge and skills of local resource users, coupled with the enabling policies and legislation of state systems, to arrive at cooperative approaches to resource management. These varying and dynamic approaches to resource management have been compelled largely through the recognition of the limited capabilities of existing management systems to adapt effectively to ecosystem change and the evolving needs of resource users. These cooperative approaches to management should not, however, be considered an institutional end-point, but rather a phase in the perpetual transition of a social system; each unique in character and individually variable depending on the resource being managed, the political climate in which management occurs, as well as the differing strategies employed by resource users to enact institutional change. Drawing from the experiences of the Whitefish Lake First Nation of Alberta, Canada, this paper presents a brief overview of the evolution of resource management theory, grounded in the real-world formation of the Whitefish Lake First Nation - Province of Alberta Cooperative Management Agreement.

AB India and Canada share a common heritage in natural resources management. Both have a colonial background, settlers and indigenous peoples; there is a history of management agencies with utilitarian attitudes, and a history of treating public lands as commodities for commerce rather than as resources for local livelihoods. This historical context guided the overall goal of this study, which was policy development for the sustainable use of mountain environments. Interviews, workshops and seminars were held with local people and resource management professionals in a comparative case study in two regions; the Kullu area in Himachal Pradesh, India and the Arrow Lakes area in British Columbia, Canada. The paper is organized around two main objectives of the work relating to the successes and failures of mountain environment resource management policies and the development of criteria for assessing and monitoring sustainability in mountain environments, in particular, criteria for examining relevant cross-cultural dimensions of sustainable development in these environments. By way of conclusion the paper considers further ways in which traditional resource policy development and implementation is being challenged by changing values and priorities; ecosystems management with people; and co-management and public participation.

AB The century is ending with failure to solve two major threats to the future: mass unemployment and growing inequality. Furthermore, in the poor parts of the world, the very possibility of sustainable development has been questioned by the economic crisis that started in Asia two years ago. This monetary and financial crisis truly deserved to be called a "crisis of development", for three main reasons. First, it hit almost exclusively most of the developing countries, at the same time sparing and even benefiting the industrial economies. Second, paradoxically, it was much more destructive in the most advanced of the developing nations. Third, it has created uncertainties and questions regarding the possibility of regaining the previous levels of economic performance that characterised "the Asian tigers". Competition is very analogous to games. Both need fair rules and impartial arbiters. Governments and trade negotiators think that these are sufficient, forgetting a third and fundamental element. To play a game, you have to learn how to play it; through education and time to train. A key to success will be access to information.

TI The limitless growth assumption
SO INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL SCIENCE JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB The propositions implicit in the Washington Consensus can be stated as follows: development is assimilated to limitless economic growth; the goal of social progress is reduced to a mere ''trickle-down" effect; the widest possible engagement in international trade is seen as the fundamental prerequisite for development; the role of the state is subordinate to that of the market; in short, there exists, or so it is maintained, one single model of rational development. This paper is devoted to a preliminary discussion of the first of the above principles. It seeks first to show the extent to which growth is indeed the centre-piece of development strategies, setting out the arguments traditionally advanced in favour of its pre-eminence, with its concomitant requirement for limitless expansion of commodity output. However, growth on this scale clearly seems not to be sustainable in the longer term - hence the need to rethink where economic,growth fits into long-term development aims and strategies and to take fuller account of the arguments, of an economic, social, and ecological nature, being put forward against this view of growth as limitless.

TI Global trends and Eastern European societal transformations
SO INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL SCIENCE JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB We give a review of Eastern European transformations, which differs from the expectations typical at the beginning of the 1990s. These transformations are tension-ridden adjustments to global trends. They include transfer and local adaptation of normative and institutional patterns from the Western world. Four global trends and their controversial effects in the region are discussed. First, instrumental activism requires efficiency of decisions and actions, but clashes with ideas and practices of sustainability. Second, modern individualism, which took the lead after the collapse of official collectivism in the region, can be destructive, as it can involve high social costs and operate at the expense of the common good. Third, the worldwide trend towards organisational rationality, which tends to separate economy, politics and culture has also brought about, in the region, unpredicted organisational pathologies and anomie. Fourth, while the conditions of the transformation encourage the universalisation of value systems, at the same time, its tensions and conflicts sustain particularistic values.

ID BASE CATION RELEASE; GREAT-BRITAIN; PROFILE MODEL; DEPOSITION
AB Long-term buffering against acidic deposition is dependent on the replenishment of exchangeable base cations from weathering of soil minerals. Therefore, the rate of chemical weathering largely determines the sensitivity of soils to acidification. One method of estimating such sensitivity is to use the critical load approach. In principle, this indicates a level of anthropogenic acid deposition beyond which a soils long-term buffering capacity is not sustainable in relation to the load imposed. Using the Skokloster classification, critical loads were assigned to the principal soil in each soil association along a section of the east coast of Ireland. The Skokloster classification is based on allocating mineral soils to a critical load range according to parent material and associated mineralogy. The soil database used was the general soil map of Ireland and the accompanying Bulletin. The resulting regional map represents the spatial variation in sensitivity of soils to acidic deposition. The resolution of the national soils data is not sufficient for local-scale studies, but it is adequate to produce maps on a regional or national scale. In the current study, the most sensitive soils were located principally in the Dublin-Wicklow mountains, which agreed well with existing field research. The application of critical load sensitivity classes to a range of soil types using a simple methodology was only possible by making extremely broad assumptions about the current soils database. For more advanced or data intensive methods, improvements in the national soils database are essential.

AB This paper examines the evolution of urban transport planning since the 1960's, identifies the key trends that have influenced such planning, describes the current state of urban transport planning, and speculates on the important characteristics that will influence urban transport planning over the next several decades. Fifteen planning conferences since 1957 are reviewed to show the changing perspectives on planning from the professional community. Ten areas are identified that will provide special challenge to future transport planners-demographic changes, the importance of economic production and market forces for transport system performance, multimodal perspectives for transport planning, adopting an operations focus, an important role for technology, developing a sense of community, laying the groundwork for pricing, integrating transport decision making with growth management, transport planning within a sustainability framework, and providing greater accountability of the decision making and planning processes.

AB One event, such as increased human longevity, is impossible to accomplish without having other, perhaps unintended, effects. In addition to the effects on human society, other arguably equally important, effects will occur in the biosphere-the planet's ecological life support system. Sustainable use of the planet requires an objective evaluation of the consequences of changes in any critical parameter such as human life span. Preliminary action may then be taken to address unfavorable consequences and to enhance the likelihood of favorable ones. The central issue is whether humans can continue to increase in both numbers and per capita affluence without causing irreparable harm to the biosphere. This issue is a matter of enlightened self-interest to human society. A concomitant ethical issue is whether humans have an obligation to share the planet's resources in a fair and equitable manner with the many millions of other species on the planet. Human longevity is only one of the factors in this multidimensional problem. However, addressing this issue will almost certainly result in a reexamination of human society's relationship with natural systems and what changes are needed to result in a sustainable co-evolution of the two systems.

TI Ecological basis for a sustainable management of the indigenous
   vegetation in a Central-Asian desert: Presentation and first results
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED BOTANY-ANGEWANDTE BOTANIK
LA English

ID TAMARIX-RAMOSISSIMA; WATER; ISOTOPE
AB To provide an ecological basis for the regeneration and the sustainable use of the vegetation at the transition between eases and sandy desert, a joint European-Chinese research project is being conducted at the southern fringe of the Central-Asian Taklamakan desert (Xinjiang, China). The investigations are being carried out at five study sites located in the foreland of the river oasis of Qira (Cele). Four of these sites are dominated by one species each, which is indigenous on a local (Alhagi sparsifolia, Populus diversifolia, Tarmarix ramosissima) or regional scale (Calligonum spec.). The fifth site is free of vegetation. Subsequent to irrigation performed by artificial flooding, the effects of the consecutive desiccation and of harvest on the water relations of soil and plants (including water-use efficiency and drought tolerance), the demand and turnover of nutrients (especially of nitrogen) and productivity of the respective species are being investigated. The composition of the vegetation and the population biology of the local species are being studied. Concomitantly, socio-economic inquiries are being performed to register the population's demand for plant resources and to provide a basis for the calculation of the management costs. The results of the study should provide a basis for the regeneration of that kind of vegetation which is best suited to meet the population's demand for plant resources and shelter from sand drift. The selection of the vegetation will be made on the basis of its water-use efficiency, productivity and capability of regeneration. The first results and an outlook for the forthcoming research activities are presented.

AB Although many have gained from the process of globalisation, there remains a stubbornly large number of people living in absolute poverty and a rise in inequality within and between countries, The issue is thus not whether to participate in the global economy but how to no so in a manner which provides for sustainable and equitable income growth. This study shows how value chain analysis can be used both ro chart the growing disjuncture between global economic activity and global income distribution nod to provide causal explanations for this outcome. In so doing, value chain analysis provides valuable insights into policy formulation and implementation.

TI TIM: Assessing the sustainability of agricultural land management

ID DRAINAGE
AB TIM (Threat Identification Model) is a framework for the ex ante assessment of agricultural land management sustainability at the land unit scale that identifies sources of unsustainability within agricultural land management systems. The model explicitly links defined hazards to land productivity and environmental integrity, land resource data and information, and land management practice options using expert and local knowledge on land management and its potential effects. The model was tested in the Crystal Creek Subcatchment, a narrow coastal strip of land situated in north Queensland, Australia. This area was chosen due to the expansion of the sugar industry onto increasingly marginal land in the area, which represents a threat to sustainable land use and a requirement for careful land-use planning and land management.
   TIM may be used in a relational database as a stand alone decision support system for land-management planning. Its usefulness in land-use planning is greatest when it is linked to a Geographic Information System (GIS) as shown in this paper. GIS allows TIM outputs, such as constraints to agriculture and site-specific best-management practices, to be identified in a spatially explicit manner.
   The main advantages of TIM are that it can be done ex ante, it removes the need to define sustainability assessment criteria and indicators, it utilises current understanding of the causes and effects of land degradation and how different land-management practices influence these, and links this knowledge to definite land-management options.

SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT

DE multiple attribute decision-making; site and watershed management;
   sustainable resource management
ID SYSTEMS; SUSTAINABILITY
AB Economic approaches to the valuation of ecological services have several limitations. Some of these limitations can be overcome using the multiple attribute decision-making model developed in this paper. The model postulates that a private or public decision-maker selects a site/landscape management plan based on the biophysical and economic attributes of alternative management plans, the decision-maker's preferences for attributes, and constraints on the selection of a management plan.
   Two cases are examined. Case A is a watershed consisting of publicly owned land that is managed at the site, management unit and landscape scales. Management is based on the philosophy of ecosystem management. Case B is a watershed composed of several privately owned units that are managed at the site scale by decision-makers whose primary motivation is economic profit. The preferred management plan in both cases is determined using a two-stage procedure. The first stage uses a stochastic programming model to identify the most efficient management plans for a site/landscape. The second stage determines which efficient management plan for a site/landscape is preferred by maximizing an expected utility function that is additive in the attributes and assumes that the decision-maker is risk neutral.
   Whether a land-management plan results in strongly or weakly sustainable resource conditions is evaluated. Strong sustainability requires the probability of exceeding the minimum acceptable value of an attribute to be greater than or equal to a pre-determined reliability level for each attribute. Weak sustainability requires the same condition except that it applies to a composite index of the attributes rather than each attribute. Bayes theorem is used to evaluate uncertainty about whether the state of a landscape is sustainable. (C) 2000 Academic Press.

AB Human trials in organ allografts have demonstrated that murine anti-CD3 mAbs are immunosuppressive. By mimicking Ag, anti-CD3 can produce T cell activation, anergy, or death, Activation of resting T cells in vivo results in dose-limiting cytokine release and is caused by Ab-mediated cross-linking of T cells and Fc gamma receptor (FcR)-bearing cells, With the goal of minimizing cytokine-induced toxicity, anti-CD3 have been engineered to lower Fc binding avidity, Preclinical murine studies have indicated that non-FcR-binding anti-CD3 can induce apoptosis of Ag-activated T cells. Since induction: of T cell apoptosis may be an important mechanism of immunosuppression by anti-CD3, we tested whether Fc mutations affect the ability of anti-human CD3 to induce apoptosis of activated T cells, We compared wild-type murine anti-CD3, M291, and OKT3 and their humanized, PcR- and non-FcR-binding structural variants in quantitative assays of T cell apoptosis, Non-FcR-binding variants produced more sustainable phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase-2, greater release of IFN-gamma, and more effectively caused activation-dependent T cell apoptosis, Non-FcR-binding variants dissociated more quickly from the T cell surface and caused less internalization of the TCR, which then remained available in greater abundance on the cell surface for signaling. Cross-linking of non-FcR-binding variants by antiglobulin enhanced TCR internalization and minimized induction of T cell apoptosis, We conclude that non-FcR-binding, humanized anti-CD3 have improved ability to induce apoptosis of activated T cells, presumably by allowing durable expression of the TCR and sustained signaling.

AB This paper examines the interaction between preferential trade agreements (PTAs) and multilateral tariff reduction in a model of imperfect competition. A growing literature finds that the formation of PTAs alters the incentives for and the sustainability of multilateral tariff reduction. We show that the causation is not one-sided: multilateral tariff reduction also affects the formation of PTAs. Specifically, tariff reduction enhances the incentives to form a PTA and increases the likelihood that it is self-enforcing. Thus, each round of multilateral tariff reduction should lead to a new wave of PTAs. This may help to explain the current trend towards regionalism. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB The effects of soil solarization and ammonium bicarbonate or ammonium sulfate against plant-parasitic nematodes on yellow squash (Cucurbita pepo) and on vinca (Catharanthus roseus) were evaluated at two sites. Solarization for 3 weeks in the spring suppressed population levels of Belonolaimus longicaudatus, Criconemella spp., and Dolichodorus heterocephalus throughout the growing season on both crops at both sites. Levels of Meloidogyne incognita were suppressed initially, but population densities increased by the end of the crop in several cases. In one site, numbers of Paratrichodorus minor resurged following solarization to levels that were greater than those present in unsolarized control plots. The effect of solarization was not enhanced by combination with ammonium amendments, but, in one site, application of ammonium bicarbonate or ammonium sulfate resulted in lower numbers of B. longicaudatus than in the unamended control. Additional research and improved efficacy of candidate amendments are required before they can be successfully integrated with solarization for nematode managements are required before they can be successfully integrated with solarization for nematode management. Efficacy of solarization against plant-parasitic nematodes was achieved despite a relatively short (3 weeks) solarization period.

AB This article establishes a framework for thinking about sustainable development in the metropolitan context by investigating the origins of the sustainability concept and its meanings when applied to urban development, surveying historical approaches to planning the urban region, and analyzing ways in which a context can be created for regional sustainability planning. Sustainability is seen as requiring a holistic, long-term planning approach, as well as certain general policy directions such as compact urban form, reductions in automobile use, protection of ecosystems, and improved equity. Based on the experience of three sample regions, the article suggests a long-term strategic approach in which vision statements, coalition building, institutional development, intergovernmental incentive frameworks, indicators, public involvement, and social learning help create a regional context in which sustainable development is increasingly possible.

AB Six of originally eight long-term trials in Halle (Saale), Germany, are still continuing. Five are situated at Julius-Kuhn-Feld, an experimental station launched by Julius Kuhn in Halle in 1866. Apart from the Eternal Rye trial established in 1878, those are phosphorus, potassium, lime, and organic fertilization long-term trials, all being launched by Karl Schmalfuss in 1949. Other longterm trials have been terminated, bur data are available on the effects of nitrogen fertilization and the physiological reaction of fertilizers. Another long-term trial in Halle (Adam-Kuckhoff-Strasse 17b) investigates the influence of fertilization on soil formation from loess, Up to now, the major results are as follows:
   1. Changes in soil-ecological properties due to fertilization and relation were only evident after 30 years, and new steady states sometimes took 70 years to occur.
   2. In the long term, the C- and N-contents of the soil largely depend on the amount of hardly decomposable organic matter applied with organic fertilization, High mineral-N doses, with consequent high crop and root residues, increased the humus content of the soil.
   3. Mineral fertilization can replace organic fertilization in terms of sustainable yield capacity provided equal nutrient amounts were applied.
   4. The high P-supply ability of the soil in Halle could not be explained by traditional soil analysis methods of calculating plant-available P. With some restrictions, the same is valid for K.
   5. At the experimental site, soluble salts (nitrate, sulphate) accumulated in the subsoil,
   6. A regular lime demand of central German chernozems could be proved, especially in case of low soil organic matter (SOM) and physiologically acid fertilization.

AB Background The aim of the study was to evaluate the use of a democratic process for prioritizing the ASQUAM (Achieving Sustainable Quality in Maternity) clinical effectiveness programme.
   Methods Twenty-two improvements in the standards of maternity care were chosen as top-topic priorities at the 1996 and 1997 ASQUAM meetings. We wished to assess the relative priorities of local and national delegates, by comparing their voting patterns at the two meetings. The setting was North Staffordshire ASQUAM prioritization days, and the subjects were all the delegates at the 1996 and 1997 ASQUAM meetings. Main outcome measures were comparison of numbers of votes cast by local and national delegates for each of the 20 topics presented at the two ASQUAM meetings, and proportions of the 11 top-topics decided at each meeting that were chosen by local and national delegates.
   Results In 1996, significantly more local than national delegates voted for two topics related to maternal mortality or morbidity (incontinence and hypertensive diseases of pregnancy), but there were no statistically significant differences between the proportions of votes cast for any of the other 18 topics presented on the day. Indeed, local delegates had prioritized 11/11 of the final top-topics, and only one was omitted by the national delegates (10/11). In 1997, significantly more national than local delegates voted for three topics relating to professional stress levels, user involvement in working groups and antibiotic prophylaxis, but there were no statistically significant differences between the proportions of votes cast for any of the other 17 topics presented on the day. Again, local delegates had prioritized 11/11 of the final topics, with only one being omitted by the national delegates (10/11).
   Conclusion There appeared to be a remarkable concordance between local and national delegates at both meetings, suggesting an underlying rationality to decision making. We believe this to be a reflection of the process of careful evaluation of outcome and intervention supported by the protection of a secret ballot, allowing free expression of individual's values.

AB This paper examines the intertwined social and environmental histories of the Cahora Bassa dam constructed on the Lower Zambesi River in Mozambique. A basic premise of this historical analysis is that social and ecological sustainability are necessarily linked. We trace the transformations wrought by Cahora Bassa and the devastating effects on peasant communities inundated by the dam's reservoir, on down-river communities and on the ecosystems of the Lower Zambesi. The grandiose aims of the Portuguese colonial state to 'develop' the Lower Zambesi by regulating the river contrast sharply with the exploitation of African workers recruited to build the dam. The project was also steeped in the discourse of national security, which provided a convenient rationale for burying information regarding the dam's likely consequences. Oral testimonies from the labourers who constructed the dam and peasants whose livelihoods were disrupted reveal the harsh costs of Cahora Bassa. Similarly, the regulation of the Lower Zambesi irrevocably altered the region's ecosystems contributing to a general loss of ecological integrity. The Cahora Bassa project demonstrates that questions of sustainability are linked to relations of domination and struggles over meaning. The history of Cahora Bassa is about an authoritarian colonial state willing to achieve a set of economic and strategic objectives using all the coercive power at its disposal without regard for the social and ecological consequences.

AB The livelihood opportunities open to people, and the diverse portfolios of activities that make lip a living, are now key areas of conceptual and empirical research. Similarly, community-based natural resource management initiatives are currently receiving wide-spread attention in both policy and academic circles. This paper draws on research conducted in western Botswana, which examined community development and wildlife management in a Kalahari Wildlife Management Area. It focuses on the livelihood dynamics of residents living in two remote settlements in the Wildlife Management Area. These livelihood dynamics are closely linked with the complex history of resource use and conflict in the area. Hunting and gathering, two key livelihood activities, are examined in detail. The paper argues that, although the natural resource base has changed, and use of natural resources has in many cases dwindled, livelihoods based on these resources remain important in terms of cultural identity symbolic significance and as a real and perceived safety net in times of stress. These findings have both positive and negative consequences for the proposed community-based natural resource management initiatives in the area. The dynamics of people's livelihoods are nor always recognised by those implementing the changes. Community-based natural resource management projects have the potential to embrace social justice and ecological sustainability. However they also have the potential to undermine rural populations' individual and collective actions to manage their resources base and maintain viable livelihood strategies at a range of levels.

AB This article sets forth a set of six principles that define and operationalize the concept of sustainable development. Using these six principles, a sample of 30 comprehensive plans was evaluated to determine how well their policies support sustainable development. Findings indicate no significant differences in how extensively sustainability principles are supported between the plans that state an intention to integrate sustainable development and those that do not. In addition, these plans do not provide balanced support of all six sustainability principles, as they support some principles significantly more than others.

AB This article articulates a dynamic capability perspective on international business. The three essential ingredients of dynamic capability-capability possession (distinctive resources), capability deployment (resource allocation), and capability upgrading (dynamic learning)-have become increasingly fundamental to international expansion and global operations. Capability possession is critical to gaining competitive advantages and determining firm-level strategies to exploit such advantages. Capability deployment is crucial to mitigating the disadvantages of foreignness and preempting emerging opportunities. Capability upgrading is essential to the evolutionary development of sustainable advantages and creating new bundles of resources. Each of these capabilities is a necessary condition for sustained success in today's world economy characterized by increasing technological advancement and business globalization.

AB Birds living in fragmented habitat may occupy territories comprising more than one patch. This paper uses a theoretical model to investigate the costs (in terms of time and energy) of crossing gaps between patches for birds feeding young in the nest, using the great tit (Parus major) as an example. When the proportion of foraging trips involving gap-crossing was small (25%), gaps of about 300-550 m (depending on body mass and flight speed) could be crossed without exceeding likely maximum sustainable daily energy expenditure (DEEmax). However, a penalty of time lost in crossing gaps of about one hour was incurred. For more gap-crossing (due to larger brood size and/or a greater proportion of gap-crossing trips), distances that could be crossed decreased rapidly to about 50-100 m and time lost increased to more than six hours. Crossing gaps at maximum range speed, rather than at the slower minimum power speed, reduced flight times by 42% and slightly reduced overall daily energy expenditure because the higher flight costs per minute were more than off-set by the shorter flight times. Smaller body mass (17 g versus 19 g) was advantageous for gap-crossing, the distances which could be crossed without exceeding DEEmax being almost doubled for the smaller mass. The influence of changes in wing morphology, fat load and prey load size on the energetics of gap-crossing were also considered. Although the model was constructed for a woodland bird, problems of time and energy expenditure associated with gap-crossing will affect many species which exploit patchy resources, especially when the spacing of the patches increases, for example due to habitat loss and modification. In landscapes where semi-natural habitat is highly fragmented and most surviving patches are small (e.g., many farming landscapes) the costs of multiple patch use may represent another mechanism by which habitat fragmentation reduces the reproductive potential of the inhabitants of habitat patches which are of acceptable or even good quality, but are small.

TI Cropping systems of tribes of Chinnar Wildlife Sanctuary in Kerala
SO MAN IN INDIA
LA English
DT Article
AB In the Chinnar Wildlife Sanctuary, the mixed farming with the crop dominance of finger millet (Eleusine corocana) and monocropping of lemongrass (Cymbopogon flexuosus) are the two sub-systems of the land-use by the forest dwelling tribal groups namely Muthuvas and Hill Pulayas. The size of the farm holding per family was not more than 3 ha in any given settlement. The study revealed that there is a wealth of traditional knowledge and practices useful to make the mixed crop cultivation an ecologically sustainable one and to conserve a large number of crop varieties. The diffusion of lemongrass to the farming system of these communities reveals the farmers' willingness to innovate and experiment. Lemongrass based cropping systems also led to use of lands that were too dry and too infertile for indigenous crops. The strategies such-as soil fertility management and development of suitable agroforestry models in tune with the local requirements and conditions need to be adopted in order to make the sub-system ecologically sustainable one.

AB The Nallamalai forests of Andhra Pradesh is inhabited by Chenchus, a primitive tribal group that subsist by hunting and gathering. In satisfying the increasing needs under the influence of acculturation and culture change the Chenchus are forced to new modes of subsistence that demands new survival behaviour. The richness of the biodiversity of Nallamalai is significant in sustaining the Chenchus in the changing scenario and consequently the sustainability of biodiversity is equally an important concern.

AB Effects of cattle population density on nematode community structure were evaluated in a rotational grazing study involving 16 experimental pastures teach 20-32 ha in size) at a cattle ranch in south-central Florida. Summer pastures were grazed from Apr./May to Oct./Nov. and winter pastures fi-em Oct./Nov. to Apr./May). Experimental design was a split-plot, with two pasture locations (winter, summer) as main plots and four cattle densities (0, 15, 20, or 35 cow-calf pairs per pasture) as subplots. With a few exceptions, population densities of most nematode genera in winter and summer pastures were similar (P > 0.10). Cattle density had relatively little effect on population levels of individual nematode genera or on indices of nematode community structure. Of the more than 50 nematode genera a found at this site, Monhystera populations were affected most frequently by the short-term (6-7 months) grazing, but the nature of the responses were inconsistent. Nematode community data showed strung seasonal trends, with many genera more abundant in autumn than in spring samples (P less than or equal to 0.05). In this study, seasonal effects greatly overshadowed an? minor effects of cattle grazing on the soil nematode community.

SO NETHERLANDS JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
DE site specific management; sustainability; nitrogen fertiliser; water
   quality; risk
AB This paper reports a methodology to define and select basic activities for spatially variable N-management, referred to as management tracks. Their main purpose is to support decision making whether or not to apply variable nitrogen fertilisation. The methodology is based on biophysical simulation of crop growth and nitrogen leaching (WAVE) in combination with economic optimisation (linear programming) and enables a normative environmental-economic evaluation of site specific N-management to be made. The partial results of a case study with an input-intensive and an input-extensive crop (ware potato and winter wheat, respectively) showed that site specific nitrogen management led to positive returns over variable costs compared to uniform N-application, conditional on the validity of the WAVE model used in simulating yield effects. The investments that could be allowed for at maximum were 6,300 Dfl and 13,500 Dfl for winter wheat and ware potato, respectively, assuming application to an area of 100 ha. A pollution tax or a tax on nitrogen designed to internalise pollution costs in agricultural production raises these maximum amounts to 7,600 and 33,700 Dfl, respectively. practical feasibility requires site-specific nitrogen management to be integrated with time specific management since optimal N-tracks were found to be highly weather dependent. Besides, spatially variable management cannot be achieved unless good farming practices (soil testing and crop scouting) are already in place.

AB Using 15 years of grazing records from two trials with 31 different sulphur (S) and phosphorus (P) fertiliser combinations on a Tekapo/Pukaki high-country soil, the most profitable fertiliser combinations for long-term sustainable production were determined from consideration of fertiliser composition, ex-works, transport, and spreading costs, increase in sheep carrying capacities, and discount rates. In a soil with a high natural surface-soil P level, the optimum returns were determined solely by elemental-S fertiliser rates. The estimated greatest net returns from annual applications rates were at 53 kp S ha(-1) yr(-1), or between 24 and 39 kg S ha(-1) yr(-1) if ratio of return versus input was considered. Using carrying capacity response functions and elemental-S oxidation rates, it was estimated that the best longterm sustainable fertiliser strategy was for 5-yearly applications of 250 kg ha(-1) of 2.2-mm coarse-particle elemental S.

ID PUFFINUS-GRISEUS
AB Sooty shearwater chicks (Puffinus griseus) harvested by Rakiura Maori on Putauhinu Island in the 1997-1999 muttonbirding seasons were larger and more developed than randomly available chicks. Early in the season, when muttonbirders extracted chicks from burrows during the day, this difference may have resulted directly from harvesters selecting areas with higher quality chicks, or indirectly from their selecting higher occupancy or more accessible areas. Later in the season, chicks were harvested after they emerged from burrows at night. Initially, relatively few, light chicks with more developed feathers emerged, and selection between them was relatively weak. As chicks became more abundant, muttonbirders selected heavier, less downy chicks with longer wings. Muttonbirders often rejected small chicks, but there was evidence for selection of larger, more developed chicks even above the estimated reject weight. When undisturbed, higher quality chicks would probably have higher survival and probability of recruitment. Harvesting larger chicks will therefore have a greater impact on the population than randomly harvesting chicks. Models investigating harvest impacts should incorporate chick quality to avoid under-estimating harvest when assessing the long-term sustainability of a culturally important traditional harvest for Rakiura Maori.

AB The UK Department for International Development's White Paper and Strategies for Achieving the International Development Targets' recognize that knowledge and technology underpin development and that the elimination of poverty, improved economic growth and protection of the environment can be achieved through support for research and development that enhances the sustainable livelihoods of poor people. This philosophy is also the foundation of the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) future strategy A New Vision for 2010.(2) The DFID Crop Protection Programme (CPP) is committed to the development and promotion of socially and environmentally acceptable management technologies to reduce crop losses from pests(3) in developing countries. Improved pest management is an essential part of a holistic approach to crop improvement, substantially contributing to poverty elimination, enhanced livelihood security and reduced environmental degradation. This article reports the progress being made in the development, application and promotion of a broad range of pest management technologies that farmers are adopting, especially in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa, home to most of the world's poorest people. Without the advances made by agricultural research, including crop protection technologies, during the past 30-40 years, the effects of poverty would have been far worse. Further support is essential to meet the challenges of producing even more food from even less land using technologies that have minimal adverse environmental impacts and that contribute to poverty elimination. Technologies such as host plant resistance, judicious use of pesticides, biological control and integrated pest management will have an increasingly important role to play in the future.

TI The need for cultivation of medicinal plants in southern Africa
SO OUTLOOK ON AGRICULTURE

DT Article
AB Traditional medicine is an important part of healthcare in southern Africa. Most drugs are prepared from plants, all of which are collected from the wild. This has led to a large number of medicinal plants coming under severe threat and sustainable harvest is no longer a viable option. Therefore, a new strategy for developing these medicinal plants as commercial crops is needed. This could be both as an alternative crop for larger, commercial farms and for the small-scale farmer. Cultivation data need to be linked with pharmacological assessments of the crop during the development of protocols.

TI North Korea's challenge of regime survival: Internal problems and
   implications for the future
SO PACIFIC AFFAIRS
LA English
DT Article
AB Many analysts have predicted that North Korea would not survive the loss of its Communist allies without undertaking economic and political reform, yet North Korea has defied the "natural laws" of the politics of transition to the post-cold war era by clinging to survival. The paper outlines how concerns about North Korea's collapse influenced the policy direction and response of the two Koreas and their neighbours, and analyzes the critical factors likely to determine the sustainability of the North Korean regime, including North Korea's continued economic decline during the 1990s; the North Korean famine; refugee flows; the energy crisis; the external security environment, including the impact of U.S. and Chinese policies toward North Korea; and prospects for political or military instability in Pyongyang. Despite North Korea's recent opening to the international community, the North Korean leadership still faces potentially dangerous political risks that must be overcome for the North Korean system to survive.

AB This study aimed to evaluate the structural quality of a Dusky-Red Latosol (Oxisol) by the following attributes: aggregate-size distribution, geometrical average diameter of aggregates, aggregates resistance to simulated raindrops impact, and penetration resistance, under no-till and conventional till systems, using the native forest as reference trial. Among the utilized methods, the kinetic energy necessary for destructing the aggregates presented the best distinction among the studied management systems. In the superficial layer, the no-till revealed bigger and more resistant aggregates, being its values of geometrical average diameter and kinetic energy necessary for destructing the aggregates around 1.37 and 2.4 times higher than the conventional till. Critical values for penetration resistance were observed for conventional till and no-till systems at 5-20 cm depth. On the other hand, in the 0-5 cm layer, the no-till presented a low value for penetration resistance, in accordance with its elevated amount of organic matter, associated with vegetal material in decomposition at soil surface. These aspects emphasize the beneficial effect of this system for the structural quality, contributing to the sustainable management of the soil.

AB Biosynthesis of secondary metabolites may be affected by environmental stimuli. In the present work, the effect of drought on the levels of an indole alkaloid (camptothecin [CPT]) in Camptotheca acuminata seedlings was investigated. Three seed sources, one from its native habitat in China and two from earlier introductions to the United States, in Texas and South Carolina, were used to compare response patterns. Progressive drought stress significantly reduced biomass production in the 3 seed sources of C, acuminata. Stomatal conductance closely followed the drought cycles, indicating the stress levels experienced by the plants. Leaf CPT concentrations showed a strong increase in the initial drought cycle in all seed sources except Texas, but they deviated in the second drought cycle, in which the South Carolina source continued to increase, whereas the Chinese and Texas seed sources decreased. CPT was inducible by drought, but the sustainability of the drought effect on leaf CPT concentrations was low and varied among seed sources.

TI Peasant federations and rural development policies in the Andes
SO POLICY SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
ID CIVIL-SOCIETY
AB This chapter focuses on a special type of structural social capital embedded in second-tier indigenous peasant federations in the Andean countries. It first examines the manifestations of this social capital and then goes on to analyze the strategies of the various social actors for its use, mainly to further the interests of poor and oppressed members, but often in the service of broader societal or narrower partisan purposes. Cases are presented to illustrate how such a social capital resource, once created, can be used or transformed for other than the original purposes. Sometimes these spillovers are socially beneficial, confirming the mutability thesis of Hirschman (1984); but in other cases the diversions can be harmful and disempowering. The authors conclude that even considering these varied uses, meso-level peasant federations, when incorporated into rural development policies, can help to achieve equity and sustainability.

AB This paper outlines the experience of the Northumberland Strategic Partnership in leading a holistic and integrated approach to sustainable economic, social and environmental regeneration in a large and diverse county, A county with a long coastline which has boundaries with the densely populated Tyneside conurbation to the south, the sparsely populated Scottish border to the north with the north Pennines to the west. The paper emphasizes the importance of harnessing the skills of all members of the Partnership, encouraging multi-agency and multidisciplinary working to secure key cross cutting outcomes. The importance of gearing partners and government mainstream programmes to regeneration and the need to access numerous other funding regimes is emphasized. The paper illustrates some of the difficulties faced and promotes the development of a more mature relationship between government, the regions, local partnerships and communities.

   intervention; Food; Serum retinol; Tanzania
AB Objective: To evaluate the long-term effects of a horticultural and nutrition education intervention in rural Tanzania.
   Design: A quasi-experimental post-test design was used.
   Setting: The research was carried out in 10 villages in Singida region, Tanzania.
   Subjects: Mothers and their children aged 6-71 months (n = 236) from an experimental (Ilongero) and control (Ihanja) area were interviewed regarding knowledge and practices related to vitamin A nutrition. Intake of vitamin A-rich foods by the children during the 7 days prior to the interview was recorded. Stools were examined for helminths and serum samples were analysed for retinol and C-reactive protein (CRP) (n = 146) for the children aged 12-71 months.
   Results: Knowledge and practices were more favourable to vitamin A intake in the experimental area than in the control area, and an increased frequency of intake of green leaves was associated with higher serum retinol values. The experimental area had lower mean serum retinol levels (13.7 mu g dl(-1), n = 75) than the control area (19.3 mu g dl(-1), n = 71). One likely confounder was the higher helminth infestation in the experimental area (n = 75, 79%) than in the control area (n = 71, 49%) (P < 0.001). Children with helminths (n = 94) had a lower mean serum retinol level than those without (n = 52) (12.3 +/- 5 vs. 24 +/- 10 mu g dl(-1); P = 0.001).
   Conclusions: Food-based vitamin A programmes can make sustainable improvements in knowledge and dietary practices but these may not necessarily be reflected in increases in serum retinol. Programme implementation and evaluation should take confounders into consideration as, in this case, helminth infestation.

AB This paper examines sustainable development in the corporate mining context, and provides some guidelines for mining companies seeking to operate more sustainably. There is now a burgeoning literature that examines sustainable development in the context of minerals and mining, most of which is concerned with sustainability at global and national scales. What is often challenging to ascertain, however, from these numerous perspectives on sustainable mineral extraction, minerals and metals recycling, environmental management, and social performance, is how sustainable development applies to mining companies themselves, and what steps a mine must take in order to improve the sustainability of operations. Since mining processes have the potential to impact a diverse group of environmental entities, and are of interest to a wide range of stakeholder groups, there is ample opportunity for the industry to operate more sustainably. Specifically, with improved planning, implementation of sound environmental management tools and cleaner technologies, extended social responsibility to stakeholder groups, the formation of sustainability partnerships, and improved training, a mine can improve performance in both the environmental and socioeconomic arenas, and thus contribute enormously to sustainable development at the mine level.

AB Reduced and no-tillage (NT) are the main management practices contributing to the stability of agricultural land. We investigate the relationships between some arbuscular mycorrhizal characteristics such as extraradical hyphal density and the production of glomalin, an insoluble glycoprotein exuded by arbuscular mycorrhizal hyphae, with physical and chemical properties of an alfisol under NT. Soils at different depths (0-50; 50-100 and 100-200 mm) were collected from plots with four (4 NT), seven (7 NT) and twenty (20 NT) years managed under NT system. Soil from a natural prairie was also sampled as a control for comparison of management agricultural systems. Data obtained showed that pH, available-P, total P and organic carbon increased according to the time under NT. The percentage of porosity severely decreased in the 20 NT soil especially at two upper horizons. The percentage of water stable soil aggregates was similar in all the soils with exception of 7 NT soil probably due to Lupinus albus was the preceding crop. Total and easily extractable glomalin increased according to the years under NT representing about the 0.36% of organic matter in the upper layer of the 20 NT soil. Close relationships were found between total and easily extractable glomalin content (r(2) = 0.97), organic C and total glomalin (r(2) = 0.96), pH and mycorrhizal hyphal density (r(2) = 0.72), mycorrhizal hyphal density and total P (r(2) = 0.74). No clear relationships between soil water stable aggregates and glomalin concentration or hyphal density were observed suggesting that aggregation and stabilization in those soils could be governed by other type of interactions.

AB Like radioactive waste, municipal solid waste (MSW) requires consideration of a complex mix of intergenerational and intragenerational risks surrounded by uncertain science. Unlike radioactive waste, MSW is a common problem and hence one often perceived to be controllable, at least until a required facility is proposed in a particular community. The intragenerational risks focused on local communities rouse intense public pressures for management. Although some of the risks can be quantified, the risk assessment process cannot deal with all questions. This article examines the multiple dimensions of the decisions required to be made and the weaknesses of a number of decision tools traditionally used. A case is made for the need to integrate decision tools appropriate to the risks into reflexive and iterative decision processes open to public involvement. It is argued that this presents the best hope of both optimizing decisions about the intragenerational risks as well as raising public debate about the importance of sustainable waste management in transgenerational terms.

AB Late in the 1998 hurricane season, Central America was slammed by a devastating hurricane. Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Belize were greatly impacted by Hurricane Mitch, one of the deadliest storms to affect the region in the past 200 years. The economies of each of these countries were badly affected. In the case of Honduras-at the time the fourth-poorest country in Latin America-its president suggested that 50 years of progress had been wiped out by the hoods and mudslides associated with this relatively short-lived storm system. Humanitarian assistance poured into the region in the first months following the disaster. As of mid-2000, various national, bilateral, international, and nongovernmental programs were in progress or on the drawing board for recovery, reconstruction, and renewed development of the worst affected countries. Using Honduras as a case study, some of the ethical issues that abound in the decisions of whom to help, when, and how to help them in the wake of such an extreme climate-related human tragedy are examined. Should development assistance be focused on those who have been directly and adversely affected by this storm, or should the emphasis be on reducing the risk of exposure by future generations to such disasters? Is there yet another approach that seeks to protect future generations from similar harm while at the same time assisting present-day victims to get through their hardships?

AB There is no such thing as intergenerational decision making, at least not yet. In fact, there is no such thing as intragenerational decision making in the context of maximizing overall social good given resource limitations, there are just decisions being made in an ad hoc fashion. Even if one assumes that there is such a thing as intragenerational decision making, no uniform standard or guidance exists to make societal decisions for the common good. Risks to society are judged unevenly within the same agency and across agencies. Decisions are made in isolation and not weighed in the societal context of what is intra or intergenerationally important. The National Academy of Public Administration (NAPA) has set forth a framework for intergenerational decision making that provides a consistent and fair basis for making tough decisions in order to address difficult issues such as the long-term disposal of nuclear wastes. NAPA recognizes that there is an intergenerational obligation that must encompass broader questions than the narrow issue of waste disposal since resources are finite and needs are great. The fundamental principles are based on sustainability with the overarching objective that "no generation should needlessly now or in the future, deprive its successors of the opportunity to enjoy a quality of life equivalent to its own." Coupled with this objective are four supporting principles of trusteeship, sustainability, chain of obligation, and pre caution. The NAPA process also recognizes that no decision can be final and that a "rolling future" view is better than making decisions for "all time." It attempts to balance the needs of the present with those of the future in an open and transparent process that is aimed at producing a decision, not just endless analysis. The U.S. Congress and president should develop a rational standard by which to judge laws that involve intra and intergenerational issues relative to the overall societal good. Present regulations need to be evaluated relative to a uniform level of risk and benefit to assess where the limited money available can do the most good for both the present and future generations in the context of NAPA sustainability principles It is hoped that decision makers will take a serious look at this process since it can work to resolve stakeholder stalemate.

AB Intergenerational justice is implicit in international commitments to sustainability. If ecological, economic, and social components of sustainability are to be achieved, there is a necessity for intergenerational justice considerations to be included in decision making. The present generation's risk judgments should include consideration of the possible outcomes for their children. But intergenerational issues cannot be considered in isolation from other current risk and fairness concerns. This article reports on a community-based integative model that describes justice and other attitudes and motivations that determine community and individual proenvironmental behavior in two nations: Germany and Australia. This model can account for a considerable amount of the Variance in political compliance as well as various proenvironmental behaviors. Group or individual self-interests have nearly no effects on global protective behavior. It is shown that universal as well as contextual principles, including distributive (within or between generations), procedural, and interactive justice, play a crucial role in fairness judgments. Other principles are also taken into account, such as efficiency, environmental rights, and rights to economic welfare. The results are discussed in relation to the importance of complex community fairness judgments in predicting and evaluating acceptance of political decisions, and for promoting proenvironmental behavior.

AB Community natural resource management (CNRM) has been extensively promoted in recent years as an approach for pursuing biological conservation and socioeconomic objectives. The rationale for CNRM is often compelling and convincing. Relatively little data exists, however, regarding its implementation, particularly the reconciliation of social and environmental goals. This article summarizes empirical evidence regarding the implementation of CNRM, based on five case studies in Nepal, the U.S. states of Alaska and Washington, and Kenya. Six social and environmental indicators are used to evaluate and compare these cases, including Equity, empowerment, conflict resolution, knowledge and awareness, biodiversity protection, and sustainable resource utilization. The results of this analysis indicate that, despite sincere attempts and some success, serious deficiencies are widely evident. In especially Nepal and Kenya, CNRM rarely resulted in more equitable distribution of power and economic benefits, reduced conflict, increased consideration of traditional or modem environmental knowledge, protection of biological diversity, or sustainable resource use. By contrast, CNRM in the North American cases was more successful. Institutional, environmental, and organizational factors help explain the observed differences.

AB A methodology is presented that explores soil survey information at the national level (1:1 M), generating sustainability indicators for wheat cultivation in Uruguay Potential yields were calculated for simplified crop production situations under several constraints, such as limitation of water availability calculated from soil physical properties and climatic conditions, and limitation of nutrient availability calculated from soil fertility and climatic conditions. Land quality sufficiency was examined by comparing these yields with the constraint-free yield conditioned only by solar radiation, temperature and the crop's photosynthetic properties. Crop growth was simulated only for areas suitable for the defined agricultural use. Model runs were repeated with inclusion of a topsoil loss scenario over 20 rears as defined from an erosion risk analysis. Comparison between crop growth simulations for the two situations, gives an indication of the changes in land quality status, which supplies an indicator for agroecological sustainability.
   On the basis of crop growth simulation it is concluded that wheat production constraints in Uruguay appear to be mainly related to water availability limitations, while nutrient availability is near optimal for the suitable soils. The simulated loss of topsoil impacts most on soil physical properties, expressed in reduced water-limited yields. Soil fertility status, evaluated bq change in nutrient-limited yields,was little affected by the scenario.

AB There is a need to develop sustainable nitrogen(N) management systems that minimize environmental losses by maximizing the use efficiency of applied fertilizers, particularly with wide-row annual crops that are often poor at utilizing N A key approach is to match nitrogen supply with crop demand using improved methods of fertilizer application and timing. One technique is to target liquid 'starter' fertilizers close to the seed, or around the roots of transplants, and to omit or reduce conventional broadcast applications. This paper examines the effects of starter fertilizer combined with various rates of seedbed and/or top-dressed N on the growth and yield of bulb onion (Allium cepa L.), crisp lettuce (Lactuca sativa L), forage maize (Zea mays Bonaf) and sugarbeet (Beta vulgaris L.). Starter fertilizer improved early growth and, in combination with reduced rates of supplementary N, gave yields comparable with higher rates of base N with each crop, except sugarbeet. The use of top-dressed N was as effective as base N in supplementing starter fertilizer and had the benefit that it allowed a top-dressing requirement to be estimated accurately using a simple nitrogen balance equation. These results, taken with earlier work, show that starter fertilizers offer clear opportunities for reducing N inputs, while maintaining yield and quality of these crops.

TI Sustainable small enterprise development in a Cuban transition economy
SO STUDIES IN COMPARATIVE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB This article examines the status of small business development in Cuba through 1999, and evaluates the potential future of small enterprises in a Cuban transition to democracy and capitalism. In any transition to democracy and capitalism, small enterprise development is highly desirable, if not essential, for creating a growing and sustainable economy. We attempt to elucidate the complex issues that will shape the development of small enterprises in Cuba's eventual transition to a market economy, as well as outline the relevant experiences of other economies in similar situations and provide suggestions for future internal and external policymakers working to further small business interests in Cuba. Special emphasis is placed on the obstacles grounded in human behaviors that are incompatible with a globally competitive market economy.

AB The article summarizes key insights from four laboratory experiments to study renewable resource management. The commons problem, which is widely held to be the cause of mismanagement of common renewable resources, was ruled out by the design of the experiments. Still the participants overinvested and overutilized their resources. The explanation offered is systematic misperceptions of stocks and flows and of nonlinearities. The heuristics that people apply are intendedly rational for static, now resources, but not far dynamic, stock resources. Simplifying and reframing the management problem, by focusing on net growth rates, is suggested as a means to foster the use of more appropriate heuristics. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB The macro model for analysis of the steel mass flow in Japan is proposed and the problems for realizing thr environmentally sustainable society are analyzed. In the model. the steels art: classified into four types; converter steel for machinery, converter steel for construction. electric furnace (EF) steel for machinery and EF steel for construction and they are assumed to be discharged from the society in accordance with lifetime distributions. The promotion of recycling increases the production of EF steel and its impurity concentration. Consequently, the amount of the EF steel supplied for machinery use is limited by the increase of copper concentration and it becomes necessity to reduce the copper contamination in post-consumer scraps in order to promote recycling. The goal contamination ratio is estimated from the calculation result on the scenario in which recycling ratio is assumed to be 100%. The reduction amount of CO2 emission by introducing the neu technology to reduce copper contamination is calculated and it is converted to the cost assuming the CO2 international emission trading, which could be invested to the development of the new technology It is shown that the investable cost is: in the range from 8.3 to 30 billion yens par year.

TI Tourists getting close to whales, is it what whale-watching is all
   about?
SO TOURISM MANAGEMENT
LA English

DE ecotourism; whale-watching; satisfaction; Tangalooma
ID RECREATIONAL USE; CANADA
AB To date research on whale-watching has tended to focus on impacts on the whales. Management approaches often rely on minimum approach distances. An associated assumption is that whale-watchers wish to get close to whales. Studies of motivation for other recreational activities show that humans seldom undertake recreational activities for simplistic reasons. Thus, this study was developed to determine the influences over whale-watchers' enjoyment, more specifically, to assess the importance of the geographical proximity of whales. Twelve whale-watch cruises at Tangalooma, Australia were surveyed and 704 questionnaires analysed. Results showed the number of whales and their behaviour, numbers of fellow passengers, cruise duration, boat construction and sea-sickness influenced satisfaction. The geographical proximity of the whales was not a major influence. Many whale-watchers (35 per cent) returned satisfied even when no whales were sighted. Whale-watching is not simply about getting close to whales, many other variables are important. A better understanding of the watchers, as well as the whales, will assist in the sustainable management of this growing tourism industry. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Solid waste management needs to be environmentally sustainable to reduce overall environmental burdens. It also needs to be economically sustainable to be affordable for all sectors of the community served. Integrated waste management (IWM) takes an overall approach to this, involves the use of a range of different treatment options and deals with the entire waste stream. The tool of Life Cycle Inventory (the goal definition and inventory stages of a Life Cycle Assessment) can successfully be applied to integrated waste management systems to assess their environmental burdens. Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) tools for solid waste management have been available for some time. Several models have been developed and applied to both theoretical and actual waste management strategies. This report reviews a case study where a Life Cycle Inventory model was applied in the development of an integrated approach to waste management.

   international law; transboundary water agreements
AB The concept of sustainable development has gained considerable attention in the field of natural resources law and policy since the United Nations Rio Conference of 1992. The practical application of the concept has. however, proved to be one of the major challenges of the 21(st) Century. Due to conflicting interests between various groups, the concept has struggled to be transformed from abstract theory to practical application. The field of transboundary water law and policy is not immune from this problem. While the concept has been mentioned in most agreements dealing with transboundary waters, it is not always clear what the normative prescription of such inclusion is. This can be seen by the varying attention that the concept, and in particular its core values, has received in recent transboundary water agreements. While the agreements show a clear commitment on the side of States to work towards sustainable development, they also demonstrate that the concept has yet to be clearly prescribed in legal terms. A review of recent transboundary water agreements leads to the conclusion that, while there are some positive signs, considerable work remains to be done in order to produce practical mechanisms designed to effectively and efficiently balance the need for development with the need to protect the environment.

AB This study seeks to examine source choice perception and sustainable rural water supply development in Ban Thadindam, a Thai village situated about 220 km north of Bangkok. Ir makes use of an elementary schematic matrix that was initially developed for the valuation of water sources as perceived by water users in East Africa. In applying the elementary choice scheme, the author interviewed the village Kamnan (district officer) and a few villagers. The results of this study show that a wine range of water supply sources was perceived by the Kamnan. Out of a practical range of six sources, four were perceived and accepted, roof train water), river, spring, and pond, and two were perceived but not accepted. well and canal. The reason why well and canal water sources were rejected was because of their hardness and turbidity. Of the four sources accepted roof(rain water) was rated very favorably as the preferred choice while river. spring, and pond sources were judged equally favorable. Awareness of source choice and the conditions under which choice is made is crucial for the understanding and development of sustainable rural water supply. By adopting a wide combination of sources and integrating them to provide a rich water supply for treatment, and by taking advantage of filtration technology given by the Asian institute of Technology, Environmental Engineering Division, the villagers, with the help of the Project Managing Committee, transformed the demonstration filtration facility into a sustainable rural water supply system. The latter succeeded not only in providing adequate filtered water for the majority of the households in Ban Thadindam bur also in satisfying the water requirements for the whole village for two decades. The success of the rural water supply system has been attributable to many factors, but most important was the awareness the villagers have in the understanding of the interrelations between landscape, range of choice and the interaction between community participation, technology and environment.

DE sustainability; Bellagio Principles; performance measures; Israel
AB Sustainability of water resources is often gauged as the gap between supply and projections of demand. This static view, however, is insufficient to judge the ability of a system to cope with uncertainty and variability, and does not monitor progress towards sustainability. That is, sustainability should be viewed as a process. not a goal. Commonly, trued performance indicators such as reliability. resiliency, and vulnerability nt-e some aspects of the concept of sustainability. They are easy to use, can monitor trends. and can be adapted to account for changes in physical and social systems that affect the concept of sustainability. The case of Israel is considered as illustration. The water system and agricultural production dependent on it have exhibited high vulnerability and low resilience and reliability in spite of change to the master water plan at the beginning of the 1990s.

ID PROMETHEE METHOD; SYSTEMS; RANKING
AB The present article demonstrates the implementation of Multicriterion Decision Making (MCDM) analysis for a case study of Flumen Monegros irrigation area in the Huesca province of Spain. The criteria used to rank alternatives consist of (1) economic factors including initial cost of irrigation system, maintenance cost, profitability of crops, extent of European subsidies; (2) environmental factors which comprise water volume, water quality after irrigation, efficiency of the use of water, resistance to floods or droughts; (3) Social factors including employment of rural labour, area non-cultivated. Alternative policies are formulated by mixing factors such as irrigation system, water pricing, water allocation, crop distribution, fertiliser use, subsidies received. Multicriterion Sorting Technique (MCST) ELECTRE-TRI is employed to reduce the large size payoff matrix to predefined categories for further usage of MCDM techniques. Five MCDM techniques, namely, PROMETHEE-2, EXPROM-2, ELECTRE-3, ELECTRE-4, and Compromise Programming (CP) are employed to rank the alternatives. Spearman rank correlation coefficient is employed to assess the correlation coefficient between the ranking patterns obtained by the above MCDM techniques. Additive ranking principle is used for group decision making analysis. Results indicate that five MCDM techniques choose the same alternative strategy as the preferred one.

TI Sustainable water management through flexible method management

AB Water management projects are complex and contain many dimensions, including the nature of the problem, technological challenges, and political relevance. Experts and consultants in water management usually work with a limited set of analysis and project planning methods. This implies that experts and consultants have a restricted spectrum for bidding on water management projects and that the engagement of a specific expert or consultant introduces a biased approach to water management. To alleviate these limitations, experts and consultants should have a readily accessible collection of analysis and project management methods at their disposal, coupled with guidelines for combining these methods to best approach a water management project. In this paper we propose a taxonomy for classifying methods used in water management. Using this taxonomy, we derive a Project Management Specification Model (PMSM) to help experts select, combine, and operationalize methods to match best the requirements posed by a project. The taxonomy and PMSM were derived and validated by analyzing more than 90 methods together with experts in the field of water management, and by using them within two new project proposals made by an engineering company. We could conclude that PMSM's broad view on water management helps experts and consultants choose flexible analysis and project management approaches, and that it increases the involvement of, and acceptance by, all parties involved in water management.

ID WILDLIFE
AB Furbearer management evolved during the past century and led to the restoration of many species, including those that were once bountied. Regulated fur trapping programs have been integral to furbearer management. Typically, such regulations were created and later modified to allow trapping to meet the goals of population management. Societal changes have placed furbearer management in the midst of contention, with the foothold trap as a centerpiece. Furbearer managers must adopt a shared vision for the future and collectively strive to achieve it. We suggest such a vision. Key components are the development of Best Management Practices for trapping; cost-effective, reliable innovations to maintain scientific rigor and leadership in assessment of furbearer populations; and an effective, integrated, internal outreach program designed to build and maintain support for hunting and trapping as sustainable uses of natural resources and management tools within state fish and wildlife agencies.

TI Extent of double-brooding and seasonal movement of nesting females in a
   northern population of Wood Thrushes
SO WILSON BULLETIN
LA English
DT Article
ID REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS
AB Accurate estimates of the amount of double-brooding within a population are an important parameter for assessing the population sustainability of forest birds. In 1998 and 1999, we color-banded adult female Wood Thrushes (Hylocichla mustelina) at 70 nests early in the breeding season to assess the frequency of double-brooding in a northern population. We found that double-brooding was a common breeding strategy among Wood Thrushes in southern Ontario. Forty-seven females fledged first broods and 74% (n = 35) of them initiated egg-laying in a subsequent nest. It is possible that at least 87% (n = 41) of the females were double-brooded, based on the evidence of 6 later nests built within 50 m of successful first nests that were depredated or fledged young before their owners could be identified. Other second-brood nests were probably missed because they were overlooked and because some females moved considerable distances (100-400 m) between nestings. Most birds that failed in their early nesting attempt were not found again on the site, precluding verification of their renesting efforts.

AB Digital signatures are a basic technology for secure communication within infrastructures like the Internet. However, every new technology involves risks as well as new opportunities for the users. Current concepts and regulations for use are problematic. It cannot be ensured that the validation of a digital signature always has the same result independent from the time of checking. Similarly, it is not clear that the validity of digital signatures can be checked at any future time. Moreover, the delivery risks of digitally signed messages are not distributed according to the responsibilities of sender and recipient. For these reasons, alternative and more comprehensive solutions are necessary.

ID INTERGENERATIONAL EQUITY; ACCUMULATION; RESOURCES
AB This paper attempts to integrate the concern for human development in the present with that in the future. In arguing for sustainable human development, it appeals to the notion of ethical "universalism"-an elementary demand for impartiality of claims-applied within and between generations. Economic sustainability is often seen as a matter of intergenerational equity, but the specification of what is to be sustained is not always straightforward. The addendum explores the relationship between distributional equity, sustainable development, optimal growth, and pure time preference. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID SUBSTITUTION; CHINA
AB Promoting sustainable development requires evaluating the technical and policy options that will facilitate the adoption and use of energy efficient and less polluting cooking stoves and practices. The transition from traditional to modern fuels and devices has been explained by the "energy ladder" model that-suggests that with increasing affluence, a progression is expected from traditional biomass fuels to more advanced and less polluting fuels. In this paper we evaluate the energy ladder model utilizing data from a four-year (1992-96) case study of a village in Mexico and from a large-scale survey from four states of Mexico. We show that an alternate "multiple fuel" model of stove and fuel management based on the observed pattern of household accumulation of energy options, rather than the simple progression depicted in the traditional energy ladder scenario, more accurately depicts cooking fuel use patterns in rural households. The "multiple fuel" model integrates four factors demonstrated to be essential in household decision making under conditions of resource scarcity or uncertainty: (a) economics of fuel and stove type and access conditions to fuels, (b) technical characteristics of cookstoves and cooking practices; (c) cultural preferences; and (d) health impacts. This model also allows better estimates of the expected fuelwood demand and indoor air pollution in rural households. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB At least 32 Amerindian groups in the Amazon basin use terrestrial invertebrates as food. Leaf- and litter-consuming invertebrates provide the more important, underestimated food sources for many Amerindian groups. Further, litter-consuming earthworms are also an important food resource for the: Ye'Kuana (also known as Makiritare) in the Alto Orinoco (Amazonas, Venezuela). By selecting these small invertebrates the Amerindians are choosing their animal food from those food webs in the rainforest which have the highest energy flow and which constitute the greatest renewable stock of readily available nutrients. Hele we show that the consumption of leaf- and litter-feeding invertebrates as a means of recovering protein, fat and vitamins by the forest-living peoples offers a new perspective for the development of sustainable animal food production within the paradigm of biodiversity maintenance.

AB This paper reviews and discusses, from an ecological perspective, the causes behind the development and spreading of pathogens in shrimp aquaculture. The risk of disease in shrimp fanning often increases with culture intensity and high stocking densities, and when polyculture is replaced by monoculture. High pond densities will facilitate the spread of pathogens between ponds. Shortage of clean water supply and insufficient waste removal lead to overloading of metabolites, environmental degradation, and to the shrimp becoming stressed by bad water quality, and thus more prone to becoming affected by disease. Excessive fluctuations in abiotic factors like oxygen, salinity, and temperature may also increase stress and susceptibility to disease. The location of farms in mangrove environments can lead to acidification that may directly, or indirectly, through release of heavy metals from the sediments, lower disease resistance. The use of hatchery-reared larvae will increase genetic uniformity and thus disease risk in comparison to the collection of wild larvae where selection has already favored the most viable individuals. Global and regional transportation of seed larvae and broodstock will facilitate the spread of pathogens. Apart from the above factors, which are all dependant on the farming itself, contamination by pesticides and pollutants from agriculture and industrial activities may lower disease resistance of the shrimp, especially if combined with other environmental factors.
   We show that shrimp farming is, to a large extent, dependent on ecological services supplied by nature, and discuss the carrying capacity of shrimp pond farming from an ecosystem perspective, including aspects like culture intensity, pond density and sustainability. Since aquaculture is basically a natural ecological process, although in intensive shrimp farming it reaches industrial proportions, it is essential that we do not forget the underlying ecological principles, as this may help us to understand and contribute to the solution of some of the disease problems faced by shrimp farming.

AB The shrimp aquaculture industry has become increasingly aware of the need for developing sensitive and precise diagnostic tools (Biomarkers) with predictive capability for assessing the toxic effect of commonly encountered chemicals on shrimp culture. Potentially damaging compounds used in shrimp culture include disinfectants, therapeutics, feed additives, algicidals, pesticides, and fertilizers. These chemicals may cause biological damage at all life stages during shrimp production. Since many chemicals may be stressors to the organisms, lower production rates may occur, compromising the sustainability of the shrimp production. This manuscript gives a brief overview about toxic effects associated with the chemicals used directly or indirectly during shrimp production. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB THE MEXICAN INSTITUTE OF SOCIAL SECURITY (IMSS) Is MEXICO's LARGEST state-financed health care system, providing care to 50 million people. This system comprises 1450 family medicine clinics staffed by 14 000 family physicians, as well as 240 secondary care hospitals and 10 tertiary care medical centres. We developed a program of continuing medical education (CME) for IMSS family physicians. The program had 4 stages, which were completed over a 7-month period: development of clinical guidelines, training of clinical instructors, an educational intervention (consisting of interactive workshops, individual tutorials and peer group sessions), and evaluation of both physicians' performance and patients' health status. The pilot study was conducted in an IMSS family medicine clinic providing care to 45 000 people; 20 family physicians and 4 clinical instructors participated. The 2 main reasons for visits to IMSS family medicine clinics are acute respiratory infections and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Therefore, patients being treated at the clinic for either of these illnesses were included in the study. The sources of data were interviews with physicians and patients, clinical records and written prescriptions. A 1-group pretest-posttest design was used to compare physicians' performance in treating the 2 illnesses of interest. We found that the daily activities of the clinic could be reorganized to accommodate the CME program and that usual provision of health care services was maintained. Physicians accepted and participated actively in the program, and their performance improved over the course of the study. We conclude that this CME strategy is feasible, is acceptable to family physicians and may improve the quality of health care provided at IMSS primary care facilities. The effectiveness and sustainability of the strategy should be measured through an evaluative study.

AB Nitrogen is a very important nutrient element in agriculture. In soils it occurs in organic and inorganic forms. Inorganic N occurs primarily as nitrate in arable soils. Nitrate is subject to various processes such as plant uptake, leaching from soils among others. Leaching of nitrates from soils is a global phenomenon. Although a lot of attention has been paid world over on this phenomenon, its importance is being felt recently in developing countries like India where the emphasis has been on the problems related to increased food production from limited cultivable land. However, maintaining delicate agro-ecosystems in order to achieve sustainable agricultural productivity while protecting the environment has attracted the attention of scientists and policy makers. This article discusses the phenomenon of nitrate leaching from soils, its impact on man and animals and means to minimize the leaching. Nitrate leaching could be a major threat to environment in different agricultural situations. By proper management of agricultural systems, these leaching losses could be reduced and pollution problems can be minimized.

AB Even though lupin (Lupinus albus L.) is known to potentially fix 150-200 kg/ha nitrogen for the use of a succeeding crop, precise information about lupin x Bradyrhizobium strain interaction under the climatic conditions prevalent in the mid-Atlantic region of the United States is unknown. We conducted two greenhouse experiments with the objective of characterizing this symbiotic relationship and to evaluate potential interaction between Bradyrhizobial strains and lupin lines. In the first experiment, performance of 60 bradyrhizobial strains was evaluated by inoculating three lupin cultivars and using combined score, which consisted of an arithmetic total of plant vigor, nodulation scores from crown root, nodulation scores from fibrous roots, shoot dry weight, and root dry weight. In the second experiment, performance of 80 lupin lines was evaluated by inoculating with three selected Bradyrhizobial strains and using the combined score, which consisted of an arithmetic total of plant vigor, acetylene reduction activity, nodule number per plant, nodule weight per plant, and dry shoot weight. Significant variation existed for all traits in both experiments except for nodule number in the second experiment. Significant Bradyrhizobial strain by lupin line interaction existed for nodulation score, shoot and root dry weights, and the combined scores. Comparison of relative ranks indicated that nodulation effectiveness was dependent on specific strain and lupin line combinations. It was concluded that specific Bradyrhizobial strain and lupin line combinations would need to be identified for successful utilization of lupin's capability to fix atmospheric nitrogen for use in low-input and sustainable agriculture.

AB Urban planning and decision-making for sustainable development urgently need data of high spatial resolution to establish the relationship between the socio-economic performance of the urban system and its different sub-units (i.e. housing schemes, commercial and industrial developments, services) on the one hand and their environmental impacts of these subunits on the other.
   To achieve this task, a system was developed to delineate urban land cover units. The approach was tested for the city of Munich. The units delineate the fine-grained pattern of urban built-up and open spaces. The typology was based on established categories of zoning and development plans. In addition, the units were delineated on an aggregated scale to generate a synoptic understanding of the urban "metabolism" for different "strategic" levels of urban planning.
   A case study on urban hydrology is presented to characterize aspects of the metabolism of the urban system. Additional case studies covered urban climates, energy demand for space heating and carbon dioxide emissions. Results showed that the cover units and types had distinct environmental features. Furthermore the causal links with urban physical and land use features were investigated. Based on the hydrological case study, environmental targets and standards to promote sustainable development are proposed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

   EU regulation
AB The European Commission has carried out a thorough review and assessment on whether pipelines conveying dangerous substances need a level of control similar to chemical installations, based on consideration of the hazards and risks and on accidents world-wide. The study examines whether sufficient controls already exist within the European Union (EU) Member States, considering the control philosophy of the 'Seveso II' Directive and the need to support development of pipeline networks across the EU taking into account the principles of sustainability. Community legislation would be supported by a set of criteria for the classification of Major-Accident Hazard Pipelines. Such criteria are examined for the onshore transmission pipelines in the EU. The Commission study has shown that there is a large variation in the degree to which Member States have comprehensive 'major-accident hazard' legislation on pipelines, and that existing legislation rarely addresses elements of the Safety Management System. The assessment, based on a proposed Pipeline Safety Instrument, indicates that there will be added value in a European Instrument drawing on the principles of Seveso II Directive concerning Safety Management System requirements.

   countries; risk assessment; risk informed decision making
AB This paper presents the results of a workshop held in Vienna in November 1998 to study the recovery of land in Easter European countries polluted by industrial spoil, military activities and improper handling of hazardous wastes, a topic which is of particular importance to these countries, emerging as they are from a period in which these topics received less attention than in the West. While the derailed situations vary from country to country among the EU candidate accession states, many of the underlying problems related to land recovery are common to all of them, and there is therefore great opportunity for mutual benefit by a meaningful exchange of information on problems, and methodologies to tackle them. The means of prioritising, monitoring and the remediation technologies are key issues in such an information network; however, without effective financing solutions, it seems very unlikely that these countries will be able to tackle their problems with contaminated land in an efficient and "sustainable" manner. The paper discusses the present situation in the first group of EU accession countries, describing the situation in the various countries and outlining the conclusions and recommendations of the workshop.

AB It is argued that the current discussion on Best Available Techniques (BAT) may not foster true sustainable production. Other instruments from the Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC) Directive, such as reporting, may be more effective in this respect. The Irish Integrated Pollution Control (IPC) system has operated for more than 5 years. Its emphasis is on prevention, environmental management systems (EMS), and reporting. Initial results are encouraging. In this paper, the system is used as a case study to illustrate the potential power of the Directive.
   EMS, if solely voluntary, may be less than effective. It is thus argued that the regulator can become involved in the process - so that EMS can be 'guided'. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

DT Article
DE errors; emergency department; public health
AB An unacceptably high rate of medical error occurs in the emergency department (ED). Professional accountability requires that EDs be managed to systematically eliminate error. This requires advocacy and leadership at every level of the specialty and at each institution in order to be effective and sustainable. At the same time, the significant operational challenges that face the ED, such as excessive patient care requirements, should be recognized if error reduction efforts are to remain credible. Proper staffing levels, for example, are an important prerequisite if medical error is to be minimized. Even at times of low volume, however, medical error is probably common. Engineering human factors and operational procedures, promoting team coordination, and standardizing care processes can decrease error and are strongly promoted. Such efforts should be coupled to systematic analysis of errors that occur. Reliable reporting is likely only if the system is based within the specialty to help ensure proper analysis and decrease threat. Ultimate success will require dedicated effort, continued advocacy, and promotion of research.

DE water logging; soil salinity; cropping intensities; subsurface drainage;
   drainage costs; drainage benefits; drainage feasibility
AB The sustainability of irrigated agriculture in India is threatened by waterlogging, soil salinity, and alkalinity. To reverse declining agricultural productivity, a combination of surface and subsurface drainage, supplemented by improved irrigation management, has been identified as the most appropriate strategy. But subsurface drainage for salinity control is costly. Therefore, its benefits in terms of sustained agricultural production must be thoroughly investigated to establish its technoeconomic feasibility. The present study attempts to do this by analysing the cost of installing subsurface drainage, the direct on-farm benefits of subsurface drainage, and the financial feasibility of subsurface drainage.
   The site of the study selected for this study is Haryana State. The results show that, after the installation of drainage, land use intensified because a sizeable area of formerly fallow land was brought under cultivation. They also show that the cropping pattern changed in favour of more remunerative crops and that crop yields increased. These immediate gains from drainage are helping to increase land productivity, gainful employment of the farmers and, hence, farm income. The financial and economic feasibility of drainage in waterlogged and saline areas looks favourable, provided that sufficient water is available for leaching and irrigation, and that a sustainable solution for the disposal of the low-quality drainage effluent is found. With regard to the latter, creating ponds to temporarily store drainage effluent is technically possible, while not threatening the financial feasibility of the investments in drainage.

AB Soil erosion continues to be a major concern for the development of sustainable agricultural management systems. Sustainability modelling analysis for soil erosion must include not only vulnerability prediction but also address impact and response assessment, in an integrated way. This paper focuses on the impact of soil erosion on crop productivity and the accommodation of agricultural use and management practices to soil protection. From the Andalucia region in Spain, soil/slope, climate and crop/management information was used to further develop an expert-system/neural-network soil erosion predicting model (named ImpelERO). Based on soil tolerance to water erosion, three regression equations were formulated to examine the effects of soil depth loss on crop productivity reduction. Also, a computerised procedure was developed to find a combination of management practices which would minimise soil loss in each field-unit. The overall approach of ImpelERO was applied in 20 selected benchmark sites from western Europe to quantify the soil erosion vulnerability with several crops, the impact of soil erosion on crop production, and the optimum management strategies. In the Mediterranean sites, soil losses reach an average of almost 50 Mg ha(-1) per year, the potential impact of soil erosion on the crop productivity was very important (up to 48% reduction in the 2050 time horizon), and the farming practices can be widely modified to protect environmental qualities. The results of this benchmark site analysis of soil erosion, however, must not be extrapolated to large geographical areas without additional spatialisation studies. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB The intensive use of Prince Edward Island (PEI) farmland for potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) production draws concern because of soil physical degradation under the intense tillage and other heavy traffic associated with the mechanisation of this crop, and the resulting vulnerability of sloping fields to hydraulic erosion. Growing public consciousness and pressure in favour of sustainable agriculture have engendered farmer interest in a possible place for commercial farm by-products in commercial cropping. Using existing natural erosion plots in PEI, the effects of compost amendment and straw mulching were assessed in terms of soil loss and soil physical condition on a fine sandy loam (Orthic Podzol). The treatment materials are local by-products of potato farming systems, and were used for an insight into the likelihood of sustainable commercial use. Compost had no effect on soil loss. Mulching reduced soil loss by almost 50%. Both treatments increased soil water content by 6-7%. Among the treatment effects on soil physical characteristics, soil penetration resistance below the root zone was reduced almost 20%; and, in the third year of the study, soil aggregate stability increased 7% with compost. Shear strength showed a strong (p less than or equal to0.05) regression relationship (R-2=0.835) with bulk density. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

   rural appraisal; smallholder farming; system dynamics

AB Time-tested, indigenous land-use systems can provide valuable information for the design of ecologically sustainable and socially acceptable agroforestry systems. One such traditional system is the growing of Acacia nilotica (L.) Willd. Ex Delile trees, locally known as babul, in rice fields of smallholder farmers in Madhya Pradesh State of central India, an area with subhumid monsoon climate and hot summer. The functional characteristics of the system were collected through participatory rural appraisal involving intensive interactions with farmers in the region during six years, and through a structured-questiornnaire survey in 25 villages, involving a total of 200 farm families. The farms had an average of 20 babul bees, ranging in age from <1 to 12 years, per hectare in upland rice fields, the tree-stand density being greater on smaller than on larger farms (>8 ha). Over a ten year rotation period, the trees provide a variety of products such as fuelwood (30 kg/tree), brushwood for fencing (4 kg/tree), small timber for farm implements and furniture (0.2 cu.m), and non-timber products such as gum and seeds. The babul + rice system was estimated to have a benefit/cost (B/C) ratio of 11.47 and an internal rate of return (IRR) of 33% at 12% annual discount rate during a ten-year period, though at a low level of income. Babul trees account for nearly 10% of the annual farm income of smallholder farmers (12 ha). By practising the agroforestry (rice + babul) system, farmers get higher cash returns on a short-term (IO-year) harvest cycle of trees, and the labour input (both family- and hired) on farms was distributed more uniformly throughout the year than in rice monoculture. Purchased inputs are seldom used in the system. The ease of management of the system, the self-generating and robust nature of the tree and the multiple products and services it provides, and easy marketability of the products are the major factors that encourage farmers to adopt the system. Furthermore, the farmers have secure ownership rights to their land, so that they are interested in long-term measures such as tree plantings on their farms. In spite of its long history and tradition as a sustainable approach to land use, the system has not attracted the attention of development agencies. More detailed investigations on its social, economic, and cultural attributes are warranted to not only improve this system, but provide insights into farmer adoption of agroforestry innovations.

AB Producers in the irrigated steppe of the southern Pocky Mountains are seeking ways to improve the summer productivity of their established cool-season grass pastures, commonly tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.). From 1994 to 1997, a study was conducted under irrigation at the New Mexico State University Alcalde Sustainable Agriculture Science Center, in which dry matter yield of monoculture tall fescue was compared with that of swards containing tab fescue in mixtures with alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), birdsfoot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus L.), cicer milkvetch (Astragalus cicer L.), and kura clover (Trifolium ambiguum M.B.) in a randomized complete block design with three blocks. Percent tall fescue in the sward and the yield of tall fescue in mixtures declined from 1994 to 1996 and then increased in all mixtures except tall fescue-kura clover in 1997. Dry matter yields of alfalfa and cicer milkvetch increased until 1996 then declined, while birdsfoot trefoil equilibrated in 1996 and 1997 and kura clover continued to increase. Combined dry matter yields followed a trend similar to that of the legume yields except that, in 1996 and 1997, yields of the tall fescue-cicer milkvetch mixture were comparable to those of monoculture tall fescue, which were 5.76 and 6.72 Mg ha(-1) for 1996 and 1997, respectively. Over the life of the study, tall fescue-cicer mill;petch yielded less than one-half that of tall fescue-alfalfa while mixtures of tail fescue with birdsfoot trefoil or kura clover were equal to each other and intermediate to the others.

ID SEDIMENT PRODUCTION; DEBRIS FLOWS; BUDGET; RISK
AB Timber harvesting in British Columbia influences (a) forest hydrology; (b) fluvial geomorphology; (c) terrain stability; and (d) integrated watershed behavior. Impacts on forest hydrology are well understood and include increased average runoff, total water yield, increased storm runoff and advances in timing of floods. Stream channels and valley floors are impacted differently by fine sediment, coarse sediment and large woody debris transport. Terrain stability is influenced through gully and mass movement processes that are accelerated by timber harvesting. Impacts on integrated watershed behavior are assessed through disturbed sediment budgets and lake sediments. The Forest Practices Code (1995) is a significant step towards sustainable management of the land in so far as it attempts to minimize these geomorphic impacts of forest in B. C.

TI Toward sustainable mountain communities: Balancing tourism development
   and environmental protection in Banff and Banff National Park, Canada
SO AMBIO
LA English
DT Article
AB Although they may have been studied less extensively than those in developing nations, mature mountain tourism communities such as Banff, Canada, potentially have useful insights to offer the international community regarding principles and practices for developing sustainable, community-based mountain tourism. Toward that end, this paper focuses on the Banff Community Plan in order to highlight 'made-in-Banff' solutions to issues of governance in sustainable mountain tourism. Banff's approach to balancing tourism development and environmental protection may be unique, given its complex 115-year history of association with Banff National Park. Nevertheless, the town now employs innovative principles such as 'no net negative environmental impact' and 'appropriate development and use' in its efforts to become a balanced and sustainable national park community. Such principles may contribute to implementation of Chapter 13 (the Mountain Agenda) of Agenda 21 and to resolution of governance issues in achieving sustainable mountain communities.

ID SOUTH-AMERICA; CLIMATE
AB The Upper Bermejo River Basin (UBRB) is the most biodiverse region in Argentina. A rugged territory and a long history of human settlement, combined with social and political isolation, have resulted in large areas with well-preserved forests, a large number of wild plant and animal species, and indigenous crops. Several factors, including agriculture expansion, intense logging activities, and oil and gas prospecting, are posing a threat to biodiversity. Current national parks and reserves are not enough to secure the survival of functional populations, especially of the large mammals. Conservation of biodiversity in the UBRB requires a broader approach: e.g, protection of the most sensitive areas outside present reserves; maintaining the remaining forest matrix under sustainable management regimes, involving the local communities in the process; and encouraging uses synergetic with conservation. Recent purchases by private enterprises of new protected areas, the willingness of local administrations to establish a new legal conservation framework, and local communities considering sustainable management of their lands, represent encouraging opportunities for the region.

AB Three markedly different models of multispecies competition-one mechanistic, one phenomenological, and one statistical-all predict that greater diversity increases the temporal stability of the entire community, decreases the temporal stability of individual populations, and increases community productivity. We define temporal stability as the ratio of mean abundance to its standard deviation. Interestingly, the temporal stability of entire communities is predicted to increase fairly linearly, without dear saturation, as diversity increases. Species composition is predicted to be as important as diversity in affecting community stability and productivity. The greater temporal stability of more diverse communities is caused by higher productivity at higher diversity (the "overyielding" effect), competitive interactions (the "covariance" effect), and statistical averaging (the "portfolio" effect). The relative contribution of each cause of temporal stability changes as diversity increases, but the net effect is that greater diversity stabilizes the community even though it destabilizes individual populations. This theory agrees with recent experiments and provides a degree of resolution to the diversity-stability debate: both sides of the longstanding debate were correct, but one addressed population stability and the other addressed community stability.

AB Research conducted at CSIRO Forestry ana Forest Products and the Cooperative Research Centre for Hardwood Fibre and Paper Science (CRC-HFPS) has investigated the feasibility of using near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy as a rapid, inexpensive method for assessing the pulpwood quality of plantation eucalypts. Michell and Schimleck (1) have published a review of this research. Since that review the methodology has been utilised in a number of research applications, which are summarised in this paper.
   Reliable pulp yield calibrations have been developed using NIR spectroscopy. A pulp yield calibration with a yield range of only 3 percentage points has been developed. It is also demonstrated that NIR spectroscopy can be successfully applied to the selection of 'high yield' trees.
   Collaborative research with the CRC for Sustainable Production Forestry has investigated the influence of fertiliser application on pulp yield in Eucalyptus globulus. An investigation of genotype by environment interactions in E. globulus has also been conducted. Further collaborative research has investigated the ability of NIR spectroscopy to estimate the cellulose content of increment core samples, with the view of using cellulose content as a secondary standard for pulp yield. Several excellent calibrations for cellulose content have been developed.
   The influence Of growth rate on pulp yield has also been investigated in trees of E, globulus and E, nitens grown on irrigated and rainfed sites. It was found that growth rate did not have a significant influence on pulp yield. This study provided a textbook example of how NIR spectroscopy can be used to provide information at relatively low cost.

TI Sustainability of marine fishing: a case study of West Bengal
SO APPLIED ECONOMICS LETTERS

DT Article
AB The marine fishery sector in India is important not only for domestic demand for protein food requirements but also from the imperatives of exports. An increased investment in this sector has taken place during the last few years and the fishing fleet has expanded at a very rapid rate. Presently, however, marine fishers are facing difficulties in fish capture in spite of exerting the same and sometimes more effort. Thus the question of the sustainability of marine fishing arises. The sustainability of marine fishing in the Digha-Shankarpur coastal region has been studied through estimation of the maximum sustainable yield based on a simple bioeconomic model. WLS estimation has been done to remove heteroscedastic disturbances. Estimated results show that actual yields of all varieties are still below maximum sustainable yield (MSY) except prawn, which has reached near optimal levels.

AB Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi as well as microbial-free inoculants used as phytostimulators (Azospirillum) or as biological control agents of fungi (Pseudomonas and Trichoderma) have shown beneficial effects on plant growth and health. The study of plants inoculated with biological control agents and AMF requires special attention because of the possibility that these fungal antagonists could also interfere with AM fungi. Our study was performed to test the effects of these inoculants upon mycorrhizal colonization in maize plants inoculated with Glomus mosseae, Glomus deserticola and natural AMF from the test soil. Populations of culturable bacteria and fungi in the rhizosphere soil were also examined since inoculation with AM fungi and other soil microorganisms can affect both quantitatively and qualitatively the microbial communities in the plant rhizosphere. Enzyme activities (esterase, phosphatase, trehalase and chitinase) were used as an index to detect changes in the microbial functioning in soil, as affected by mycorrhizal and other inoculation treatments. None of the microbial inoculants used, even those biocontrol agents of fungi, showed negative effects on AM establishment. Mycorrhizal colonization induced qualitative changes in the bacterial population depending on the inoculant combination involved. Esterase activity was particularly increased by G. mosseae (256%), phosphatase activity by natural AMF (166%), chitinase by G. mosseae (197%), G. deserticola (152%) and natural AMF (151%), and trehalase by G. deserticola (444%). As a result of mycorrhizal colonization and microbial inoculation, modifications of the microbial community structure and ecology were found. An understanding of these effects as part of ecosystem processes is essential for obtaining the maximum benefit for plant growth and health in the context of soil-plant system sustainability.

AB The present investigation aimed to analyze the role of agroforestry systems in improving soil organic matter status, microbial activity and nitrogen availability with a view to effective management of the fertility of moderately alkaline soils. The study site was located at Karnal (29 degrees 59'N, 76 degrees 51'E, 250 m.s.l.) and the systems were characterized by a rice-berseem crop rotation; agrisilvicultural systems of Acacia, Eucalyptus and Populus along with rice-berseem and single species tree plantations. Soil microbial biomass was measured using the fumigation extraction technique and nitrogen mineralization using the aerobic incubation method. Microbial biomass carbon was low in rice-berseem crops (96.14 mug g(-1) soil) and increased in soils under tree plantations (109.12-143.40 mug g(-1) soil) and agrisilvicultural systems (133.80-153.40 mug g(-1) soil). Microbial biomass was higher by 42% (microbial C) and 13% (microbial N) in tree-based systems as compared to monocropping. Microbial biomass immobilized 2.32-2.57% of the soil carbon and 4.08-4.48% of the soil nitrogen in tree-based systems. Soil carbon increased by 11-52% due to integration of trees along with the crops for 6-7 years. Cropland management practices and tree species influenced CO2-C production, biomass specific respiratory activity, and nitrogen mineralization rates. In tree-based systems, soil inorganic N levels were higher by 8-74% and nitrogen mineralization by 12-37% as compared to monocropping. On the basis of increased soil organic matter content, enlarged soil microbial biomass pool and greater soil N availability, agrisilvicultural systems have been found to be ecologically sustainable land-use systems for utilizing moderately alkaline soils.

AB 1. Economic development in arid regions is closely linked to efficient use of limited water resources. As such, management and conservation of these water resources requires concurrent optimization of the interrelationships between supply quantity and resource quality.
   2. Multiple uses of water resources generate conflicting needs within management, with different uses requiring objective characterization of quality for different management scenarios and goals.
   3. A sound management programme needs close interactions between water policy makers, managers, users, engineers and limnologists, and thus needs a common language that can transcend the boundaries of the individual fields.
   4. This paper describes a system of water quality indices and standards designed for conservation and sustainable management of Lake Kinneret (Sea of Galilee), Israel, based on observed variability in various chemical and biological parameters during a 25-year period (1969-1992). Such a system can form a common language which can then be used as a tool for optimal management.
   5. This system of water quality indices (a) includes both traditional limnological parameters (plant nutrients, chlorophyll, primary production) and engineering parameters (coliform bacteria, turbidity), (b) is acceptable to all parties involved in lake management, and (c) is easily adaptable to different management scenarios and to management-induced changes in ecosystem functioning.
   6. Analysis of variability in these water quality parameters in Lake Kinneret during 1994-1999 when the lake was showing signs of destabilization highlights the usefulness and limitations of this system. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Economics, especially the narrowly defined form of economics known as neo-liberal economics, along with its policy derivative known as economic rationalism, dominates public and political debate and decision-making in Australia and many other nations as the twentieth century approaches its close. In the context of environmental issues, as also in that of welfare issues, the present over-dominance is unhealthy. Despite the best attempts of environmental economists and ecological economists, they have had relatively little influence on the broader economic profession, or on the political and business communities. Economics and free trade also dominate the international scene at the expense of equity and environmental issues. Environmental debates, by their very nature, are usually complex, requiring interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary approaches which include the economic perspective, but much else besides. Despite the importance of local context and spatial and temporal location, there is a need for a meta-theory or national philosophy to allow the integration across space and time so often needed. The present meta-theory, firmly based in economic rationalism, is inadequate as a basis for environmental decision-making. We desperately need a new meta-theory that explicitly integrates economic, environmental, welfare and many other perspectives. Perhaps such a meta-theory could be broadly based on the concept of sustainability, though much more work is needed to refine such an approach. A major swing in public opinion from the old meta-theory to the new is essential as a forerunner to political action, and education at all levels is needed to bring about this change. There are some signs that this change is already informing public opinion, and that it may have begun to influence mainstream Australian politics.

AB Global environmental politics and policy are conventionally seen as the province of nation-states and international negotiations. However, there has been increasing attention devoted to the part that local places can play in the pursuit of (global) sustainable development. In this paper, I explore the role of local government in Australian greenhouse policy. A brief outline of the role of local government in environmental management is followed by a short history of greenhouse policy in Australia. From its initial marginal position, local government has begun to occupy a more prominent role in greenhouse policy development and implementation. The paper examines the processes that have led to this change, the development of local greenhouse and energy policies in Newcastle, New South Wales, and the initiation of the 'Cities for Climate Protection' program by the federal government. In conclusion, some thoughts on the problems and prospects of a local approach to the greenhouse issue are offered.

AB Fengshui deserves serious scrutiny from geographers. Fengshui has been a highly significant influence on the shaping of human environments in the Chinese cultural sphere for at least 4000 years. Efforts to eliminate it in the twentieth century, by Chinese governments intent on modernisation, have failed. Advice on fengshui is still eagerly sought today by families and businesses in Chinese communities, whether on the mainland, offshore or overseas. The first part of this paper briefly introduces fengshui. The second part applies Lefebvre's three modalities of space to the time-space manipulations and outcomes of the operation of fengshui. The third part explores what fengshui offers a postmodern world, concentrating on (a) the nature of the 'harmony' it seeks to establish between people and nature; (b) the nature of fengshui's time-universe; and (c) the extent to which fengshui's goals of time-space harmony offer a framework for approaching sustainable development.

   agriculture; community participation; volunteers; rural development
ID AUSTRALIA; PARTICIPATION
AB Landcare is an important example of the potential of state-sponsored participation to establish viable local organisations and contribute to rural development. In this paper, the authors discuss their research using organisational theory to explore Landcare effectiveness. Data were obtained from a mailed survey to Landcare groups in the state of Victoria during 1998. Levels of group activity were used as a surrogate measure of group effectiveness. Groups were ranked according to their level of activity to assess the impact of factors likely to affect group performance, the efficacy of program logic, and the extent groups were contributing to program goals. Survey data suggested key aspects of Landcare Program logic were sound. Examination of the membership and activity profiles of groups suggested 90 per cent of the respondent groups were making a worthwhile contribution to program goals. This research also confirmed the importance of factors identified by others as significant influences on organisational effectiveness: the importance of having clear goals, objectives and plans; resource availability; facilitation by an outside agency; access to a funded group co-ordinator; and communication between stakeholders. Unfortunately, there are critical, ongoing management issues surrounding many of these topics.

AB The paper compares and contrasts the development experiences of two fisheries-dependent archipelagos: the Shetland Islands, located in the temperate seas of the North-east Atlantic, and the Lau community of the island of Malaita, in the Solomon Islands of the tropical Pacific Ocean. Whilst the coastal communities of both island groups have always depended upon the sea for their livelihood, their indigenous peoples are distinct in origins, culture, historic tradition, economy, and social imperatives. However, a closer examination of the recent development of the two archipelagos reveals that, whilst they are contrasting in the fisheries sector specifics, they have, over different time scales, adopted similar management strategies in the pursuit of sustainable fishing. In both instances, the island communities have sought to support the local fisheries economy by tempering the external forces of the centre. This has been achieved, with varying degrees of success, by adopting management control and resource 'ownership' strategies in response to social and economic turbulence in the environment. The experiences of the two archipelagos have demonstrated that to maintain a coherent fisheries management strategy over time and a sustainable resources base requires a pro-active approach, the input of resources, and moderation of the pressures created by the market. The future is uncertain as the fisheries organisations of the archipelagos seek to stabilise the access and ownership arrangements applied to the common-property fisheries resources of coastal waters.

AB An ethnozoological research was carried out in the Tabora District (central-western Tanzania) from December '95 to February '96, to gather information on the sustainable exploitation of wildlife there and to outline the zoological culture of the native people (the Banyamwezi). The objective was to describe the hunting activity and the techniques employed in capturing wild mammals and to gather quantitative data on game harvest. An inventory of the mammal species living in the study area was conducted by three different methods: (1) direct field observation of animals and their tracks; (2) identification of animals captured by the villagers; (3) interviews with the hunters. The activities of 10 local hunters from seven villages were followed during a nine week period. The number of mammals killed and the techniques used for each species were recorded. Other data were collected through interviews of the villagers and concerned (1) the use of every species as food or for other purposes; (2) the species considered as pests; (3) the best places and time for hunting the different species; (4) the time spent hunting them; (5) the food restrictions and taboos; (6) the extent of the bushmeat market (quantity, price, etc.). A total of 236 animals belonging to 37 species were killed during the study period with the following breakdown into taxonomic groups: Bovidae (44.06%), Carnivora (22.88%), Lagomorpha (8.05%), Rodentia (7.2%), diurnal Primates (5.93%), Insectivora (4.23%), Hyracoidea (0.84%), nocturnal Primates (0.84%), Hippopotamidae (0.42%) and Pholidota (0.42%). Four different techniques were used by local hunters in the study area: guns (53.81%), traps (19.06%), spears (11.01%) and dogs (16.01%). Poaching is rampant because of the scarcity of ranger staff and vehicles for patrolling.

AB Tropical trees in the genus Aquilaria Lam. are the principal source of gaharu, one of the most valuable forest products traded internationally. Although these species are the focus of increasing conservation concern, information on their status and distribution is lacking. Information from herbarium accessions, a national forest inventory (NFI), field surveys and gaharu traders was used to assess the distribution of Aquilaria species in Indonesia, indicating population concentrations in Sumatra and eastern Kalimantan. Analysis of NFI data indicated that population densities are relatively low, with values generally <1.2 individuals ha(-1); mean values recorded in field surveys were <0.6 individuals ha(-1). Analysis of probability distributions emphasized the rarity of Aquilaria species, with a probability of encountering one or more individuals of Aquilaria in 1 ha being less than 0.2 in field assessments. Calculation of Morisita's index of dispersion indicated that the species are generally clumped, with Ip typically <0.6. Analysis of stand structure suggested continuous recruitment in some areas, but a general absence of larger individuals. Given current deforestation rates, these data suggest that all Aquilaria species in Indonesia classify as Vulnerable according to the IUCN Red List criteria. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

TI Damage on South African coral reefs and an assessment of their
   sustainable diving capacity using a fisheries approach
SO BULLETIN OF MARINE SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB Coral reefs in a marine reserve at Sodwana Bay (27 degrees 30 'S) make it a premier dive resort. Corals are at the southern limits of their African distribution on these reefs which are dominated by soft corals. The coastline is exposed and turbulent. An assessment of the degree to which sport diving damages the reefs is needed for their management. This study showed that recognizable diver damage is generally concentrated in heavily dived areas. This damage and that of unknown cause probably attributable to divers exceeded natural damage on the reefs, despite the normally rough seas. Fishing line discarded in angling areas also caused considerable damage by tangling around branching corals which become algal fouled and die. Heaviest damage was caused in isolated areas by a minor crown-of-thorns outbreak. A linear regression indicated that 10% diver damage occurs at 9000 dives per dive site p.a. Taking uncertainty into account, a precautionary limit of 7000 dives per dive site p.a. was recommended. Further recommendations are that the reefs be zoned in terms of their sensitivity to diver damage, depth and use by divers according to qualification, and a ban be placed on the use of diving gloves to reduce handling of the reefs.

TI Reconceptualizing participation for sustainable rural development:
   Towards a negotiation approach
SO DEVELOPMENT AND CHANGE
LA English
DT Article
ID MANAGEMENT; APPRAISAL
AB In many popular intervention methodologies aimed at stimulating sustainable rural development tin the widest possible sense) the idea of 'participation' is a leading principle. This article will demonstrate that the process in which actors are supposed to participate is often thought of as being a process of planning, decision-making and/or social learning. It will be argued that such an operationalization of development processes is based on inconsistent theoretical assumptions, and can easily lead to unproductive development interventions due to an inability to handle conflicts. As an alternative it is proposed to use negotiation theory as a basis for organizing participatory development efforts. The implications of such a shift in thinking about participation are far-reaching: it requires new modes of analysis, and different roles, tasks and skills for facilitators of participatory processes.

ID ETHICS
AB This article attempts to contribute to ethical perspectives on sustainability initiatives by comparing the relationship between economy and society in the usury debate in early modern England and the sustainability debate in the late 20th century. This comparison highlights that the changing relationship between economy and society has been a self-conscious and hotly debated struggle among Various groups at various times in history. The article concludes that if sustainability is going to be a viable ethical project, it may have to reclaim access to social and political relations which have been increasingly privatized in market economy throughout the modern period.

AB Tourism is viewed in many industrial nations as an environmentally friendly way to revitalize distressed rural economies and communities. In the forest regions of Dalarna and interior Maine: hopes are pinned on nature-based tourism, with the presumption that natural capital is underutilized. This paper explores the potential and pitfalls of nature tourism as a basis for sustainable rural development in regions where most land is held privately but quasi-open access for recreation has been either a right (Dalarna) or a customary entitlement (Maine). The paper applies theories of common pool resources and impure public goods to show that both property regimes are mal-adapted for sustainable nature tourism. Limited exclusion combined with rivalness in land uses mis-aligns incentives facing landowners, tourists, and recreation businesses. Short-term effects include congestion, reduced economic opportunity, and depressed production of non-recreational goods. Longer-term effects include environmental degradation and weak incentives for value-added investment. Tourism development is further impeded by a scale mis-match between small ownerships and large efficient recreation management units. The analysis suggests that sustainable nature tourism faces four land use challenges. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This study is an emergy evaluation of Mai Po mangrove marshes. The important emergy indices of the system are as follows, the total output emergy of the marshes is 26.39 x 10(17) sej/year; its macroeconomic value is 25.87 x 10(5) per year (in 1988 Hong Kong); its emergy density is 6.94 x 10(11) sej/m(2) per year; and its investment ratio (IR), environmental loading ratio (ELR), yield ratio (YR) are 0.48, 1.03, and 3.10, respectively. The emergy of education function in Mai Po was tentative calculated as 125.65 x 10(17) sej/year, its macroeconomic value is 123.19 x 10(5) $ per year (in 1988 Hong Kong), in which the knowledge distribution is outstanding, about 99.26 x 10(17) sej/year, the macroeconomic value is 97.31 x 10(5) $/year (in 1988 Hong Kong), occupied 92% of all investments of whole education system. These data show that used emergy of per area in Mai Po is high and the management and education function of the natural reserve is good, but environmental loading is high.

AB The maximal running speeds of lizards have commonly been measured using level racetracks in a laboratory, but the normal speeds of locomotion of lizards and most animals in their natural habitats are not well documented. Thus we quantified the locomotor activity of the lizard Uma scoparia in its natural sand-dune habitat to determine how commonly animals run near their maximal speed and how inclines in the environment might affect habitat use and the speed of locomotion. We used leaf blowers to erase footprints in the sand in three 40 m x 100 m plots differing in surface topography and vegetation and then measured attributes of the paths and tracks left by U. scoparia that were not disturbed (by observers) during their period of peak activity. Laboratory observations allowed us to estimate speed for each field measurement of stride length (n = 5993). The frequency distribution of stride speed had two distinct modes (mean values 0.25 and 2.00 m/s), for which only the lower one is likely to be aerobically sustainable. Bipedal locomotion was extremely rare (<0.5% of all strides), but much undisturbed locomotion was unexpectedly fast. The inclines of the surfaces upon which locomotion occurred conformed to random habitat use. In contrast, the inclines of paths made by lizards had lower than expected amounts of nearly horizontal locomotion and a propensity for traveling almost directly uphill, especially when surfaces were steep. Habitat structure varied significantly among plots and affected several aspects of locomotion. For example, path length, average speed per path, and average magnitudes of path and surface inclines per path varied significantly among the three plots. Multiple regression analysis also revealed that the average speed per 1-m interval was maximized for paths with relatively shallow downhill slopes (-6% grade) and decreased significantly both with increased amounts of vegetative cover and increased turning between successive intervals. Unexpectedly, during undisturbed and escape locomotion, lizards used inclines similarly.

AB bargaining game. As is well-known, in this game every individually rational allocation is sustainable as a Nash equilibrium (also as a subgame perfect equilibrium if players are sufficiently patient and if n > 2). Moreover, delays in agreement are also possible in such equilibria. By limiting ourselves to a plausible notion of complexity that captures length of memory, we find that the introduction of complexity costs (lexicographically with the standard payoffs) does not reduce the range of possible allocations but does limit the amount of delay that can occur in any agreement. In particular, we show that in any n-player game, for any allocation z, an agreement on z at any period t can be sustained as a Nash equilibrium of the game with complexity costs if and only if t less than or equal to n. We use the limit:on delay result to establish that, in equilibrium, the strategies implement stationary behavior. Finally, Re also show that "noisy Nash equilibrium" with complexity costs sustains only the unique stationary subgame perfect equilibrium allocation.

TI The pensions green paper: A generational accounting perspective
SO ECONOMIC JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB In this note we show how the policy proposals contained in the government's Green Paper on pensions (DSS, 1998) affect the long term sustainability of the UK's public finances and redistribution between current and future generations. Using the methodology of generational accounting we show that the proposals in the Green Paper will marginally increase the tax rise needed to ensure intertemporal solvency, and slightly worsen generational imbalances. The effect of implied changes in National Insurance Contributions, and the fiscal and generational implications of fully funding the proposed State Second Pension, are also discussed.

AB The problem of multiple scales permeates the study of ecological process and pattern, uniting aspects of space, time, and organizational complexity. In particular, it supports the maintenance of biological diversity, allowing for the magnification of underlying patterns of variation in the physical environment to create many resources from few, through the evolutionary diversification of species' niches and life histories. Specialization to particular stages of a successional gradient facilitates coexistence of multiple types in the presence of uncorrelated local disturbances, such as gap formation, which reinitiate successional sequences. Superimposed upon such successional dynamics are the effects of multiple stable states and multiple successional pathways (Levin 1976), which increase diversity even more. Multiple stable states more generally raise the possibility of sudden flips of systems from one stable configuration to another, and with such changes may come huge changes in the biotic composition. On larger spatial scales and longer time scales, these flips may become correlated resulting in the transformation of the landscape, or may result in sustained spatiotemporal mosaics of states. Instability at the local level may lead to the maintenance of biodiversity on broader scales. Finally, the ultimate scale mismatch involves that between the dynamics of natural systems and the cultural dynamics of human societies. Our ability to live sustainably in a global commons is dependent upon adjusting normative behavior, and tightening feedback loops more generally, so that individual actions serve the common good.

AB The restoration and rehabilitation of the native fish communities is a long-term goal for the Laurentian Great Lakes. In Lake Superior, the ongoing restoration of the native lake trout populations is now regarded as one of the major success stories in fisheries management. However, populations of the deepwater morphotype (siscowet rake trout) have increased much more substantially than those of the nearshore morphotype (lean lake trout), and the ecosystem now contains an assemblage of exotic species such as sea lamprey, rainbow smelt, and Pacific salmon (chinook, coho, and steelhead). Those species play an important role in defining the constraints and opportunities for ecosystem management. We combined an equilibrium mass balance model (Ecopath) with a dynamic food web model (Ecosim) to evaluate the ecological consequences of future alternative management strategies and the interaction of two different sets of life history characteristics for fishes at the top of the food web. Relatively rapid turnover rates occur among the exotic forage fish, rainbow smelt, and its primary predators, exotic Pacific salmonids. Slower turnover rates occur among the native lake trout and burbot and their primary prey-lake herring, smelt, deepwater cisco, and sculpins. The abundance of forage fish is a key constraint for all salmonids in Lake Superior. Smelt and Mysis play a prominent role in sustaining the current trophic structure. Competition between the native lake trout and the exotic salmonids is asymmetric. Reductions in the salmon population yield only a modest benefit for the stocks of lake trout, whereas increased fishing of lake trout produces substantial potential increases in the yields of Pacific salmon to recreational fisheries. The deepwater or siscowet morphotype of lake trout has become very abundant. Although it plays a major role in the structure of the food web it offers little potential for the restoration of a valuable commercial or recreational fishery. Even if a combination of strong management actions is implemented, the populations of lean (nearshore) lake trout cannot be restored to pre-fishery and pre-lamprey levels. Thus, management strategy must accept the ecological constraints due in part to the presence of exotics and choose alternatives that sustain public interest in the resources while continuing the gradual progress toward restoration.

AB This paper summarises the contributions to a special issue of Energy Policy aiming to assess the viability of solar photovoltaics (PVs) as a mainstream electricity supply technology for the 21(st) Century. It highlights the complex nature of such an assessment in which technical, economic, environmental, social, institutional and policy questions all play a part. The authors summarise briefly the individual contributions to the special issue and draw out a number of common themes which emerge from them, for example: the vast physical potential of PVs, the environmental and resource advantages of some PV technologies, and the fluidity of the market. Most of the authors accept that the current high costs will fall substantially in the coming decade as a result of improved technologies, increased integration into building structures and economies of scale in production. In spite of such reassurances, energy policymakers still respond to the dilemma of PVs with some hesitancy and prefer to leave its evolution mainly in the hands of the market. This paper highlights two clear dangers inherent in this approach: firstly, that short-term cost convergence may not serve long-term sustainability goals; and secondly, that laggards in the race to develop new energy systems may find themselves faced with long-term penalties.

AB Solar electricity produced by photovoltaic solar cells is one of the most promising options yet identified for sustainably providing the world's future energy requirements. Although the technology has, in the past, been based on the same silicon wafers as used in microelectronics, a transition is in progress to a second generation of a potentially much lower-cost thin-film technology. Cost reductions from both increased manufacturing volume and such improved technology are expected to continue to drive down cell prices over the coming two decades to a level where the cells can provide competitively priced electricity on a large scale. The subsidised, urban residential rooftop application of photovoltaics is expected to provide the major application of the coming decade and to provide the market growth needed to reduce prices. Large centralised solar photovoltaic power stations able to provide low-cost electricity on a large scale would become increasingly attractive approaching 2020. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB The objective of this paper is to suggest a methodology that will help us to determine if the present rate and direction of technological change is compatible with the development of a sustainable society. We combine two perspectives on technology assessment. The first focuses on current techno-economic trends and the second on long-term resource and environmental constraints to the diffusion of a new technology. We apply our approach to the case of solar cells. Based on an analysis of technology, actor and market dynamics we suggest that thin-film solar cells are about to dominate the industry. Within the thin-film family, there is competition between alternative designs. The diffusion of three of these will, however, be limited by resource, and perhaps emission, constraints. One design (a-Si) fares much better in terms of these constraints but is less efficient. Three policy issues are identified. First, the diffusion of solar cells is not yet self-sustained and further policy intervention is required. Second, the problems of the current thin-him designs suggest that there is a need for policies both to sustain variety and to balance that requirement with the short-term requirement of cost reduction. Third, policy must ensure that a diffusion of solar cells containing scarce metals does not lead to an erosion of environmental constraints. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

DE case-study; solar; village
AB The Sydney 2000 Olympic Games incorporates an athlete's village which is part of a larger new residential development called Newington, aimed at creating a practical example of more sustainable living for the 21(st) century. Newington has a range of environmental features including solar hot water, solar photovoltaics, energy efficient design and water recycling for irrigation and toilets. Each home will have 1 kW (peak) of roof integrated PV connected to the grid via an inverter system. This paper presents a case study of the management, design, installation and testing of the solar village PV systems and also discusses related policy issues and requirements. The Newington development demonstrates that using today's technology a high concentration of solar power may be readily integrated into a residential development with benefits to all participants. However, work is needed to allow sustainable options to be made available to the mainstream market. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Photovoltaics in Zimbabwe: lessons from the GEF solar project
SO ENERGY POLICY
LA English
DT Article
ID POWER
AB This paper explores the complexities associated with the diffusion of small-scale photovoltaic systems in rural areas of developing countries. It describes in particular the experience of the GEF Solar project in Zimbabwe and the impact that this project has had on the domestic solar industry. The authors draw a number of valuable lessons from these experiences. Donor-driven energy projects bring about direct benefits to the users and can help to stimulate technology transfer and capacity building initiatives. However, such projects also have a tendency to distort marker prices, hence directly undermining the already feeble renewable energy industry, and quite often they are predisposed to focus on activities occurring only during the project's lifetime. The authors argue that the Zimbabwean experience illustrates that a sustainable energy development programme requires a multi-pronged intervention that is well co-ordinated with a clear view of specific engagements beyond the donor commitment period.

ID MANAGEMENT; VALUATION
AB In recent years, Turkey has experienced rapid economic and population growth coupled with both an equally rapid increase in energy consumption and a vast disparity in welfare between socioeconomic groups and regions. In turn, these pressures have accelerated the destruction of productive, assimilative, and regenerative capacities of the ecosystems, which are essential for the well-being of the people and the economy. This paper describes the structure and function of major ecosystem types in Turkey and discusses the underlying causes of environmental degradation in the framework of economy, energy, environment, and ethics. From a national perspective, this paper suggests three sustainability-based policies necessary for Turkey's long-term interests that balance economic, environmental, and energy goals: (1) decoupling economic growth from energy consumption growth through the development of energy-efficient and renewable energy technologies; (2) linking economic efficiency and distributive justice of wealth and power through distributive and participatory public policies; and (3) integrating the economic and ecological systems through the internalization of externalities and ecosystem rehabilitation.

AB International declarations and charters have been produced to encourage and support higher education institutions (HEIs) to address their environmental responsibilities. This paper discusses the results of a critical examination of a range of international HEIs that have signed the global environmental Talloires Declaration. II also assesses the Talloires Secretarial (University Leaders for a Sustainable Future, ULSF) and the extent to which this has been a primary stimulus. An international survey was undertaken and the results presented in a discursive format in order to highlight key driving forces, barriers, and opportunities for environmental responsibility in HEIs. Analysis reveals that they occur on two distinct and evolving levels: the macro national framework level and the micro institutional framework level. Survey responses revealed that none of the HEIs have an embedded institutional environmental culture and most did not have all the micro institutional mechanisms in place for an integrated university-wide environmental response. Many of the institutional barriers to environmental responsibility occurred as a result of this lack of strategy. The most significant institutional opportunity cited was enthusiastic individuals, particularly those at senior management or directorate level, and these individuals were found to be a key driving force. Results also showed that environmental reporting along the lines developed by the private sector is a flexible mechanism that can stimulate progress internally and externally and can be cost effectively disseminated via the World Wide Web. Moreover the survey results indicate that ULSF is not currently a primary stimulus for institution wide action.

AB Species/variety mixtures of Salix are used as a disease control strategy for rust (Melampsora epitea Thum. var epitea) in short rotation coppice (SRC). Six LET (larici-epitea typica) pathotypes and two LR (larici-retusae) pathotypes of hi. epitea var. epitea and also M. caprearum were detected ill Northern Ireland plantations in 1994 and 1995. Three of these, LET7, LET8 and NI5 were detected in plantations for the first time. The predominant pathotype on most varieties was LET1, Logistic analysis showed that this pathotype was less prevalent on Salix x dasyclados Wimm, and more prevalent on S. viminalis L. 'Bowles Hybrid: than on S. viminalis '683'. The Shannon-Weaver Index of diversity indicated that there was greater pathotype diversity in mixtures than on the constituent varieties in monoculture. There was also a general trend of increasing diversity as the season progressed. The lowest pathotype diversity was recorded on S. viminalis 'Bowles Hybrid'. Pathotype predominance and diversity have an impact on the sustainability of the crop.

AB The storage of available soil fertility elements is a cornerstone of the sustainability of forest elemental cycles at the local scale, as well as to those on the global scale. Total soil elemental storage per m(2) for relatively undisturbed sites utilizing cumulative depth functions of amounts of storage for local soil pit profiles was eventually expanded to a world wide database from more than 3000 sites. Examples are presented that apply these data to carbon and nitrogen storage problems ranging in scale from local sites in California's Lake Tahoe Basin to soils at global levels.

AB Because of the rapid increase in the world's population, demand for forest products is increasing while large amounts of forest land are being lost or degraded. In addition, timber harvest is being restricted in many of the world's natural forests. The use of plantations managed for timber production must increase to meet the world's increasing demand for wood and fiber from this reduced land base. Concentrating timber production on the best-adapted sites will allow the world's demands to be met on fewer acres. Intensive management of plantation forests is perhaps the only way to meet the increasing demand for forest products and still reserve large areas of native forests for conservation and preservation purposes. Maintaining long-term soil productivity in these intensively managed plantations is critical. The impacts of intensive management on soil quality and subsequent tree growth can be positive, neutral or negative; the direction and magnitude of the impact depends on the specific management practice soil physical, chemical and biological properties. In order to understand and predict the impacts of intensive management, the factors limiting productivity on each specific site must be understood.
   Forest harvesting by itself tends to have minor impacts on soil quality and long-term site productivity. Compaction during timber harvesting can degrade the soil quality. However, tillage during site preparation can in most cases restore soil physical properties to pre-disturbance levels. Site preparation practices that remove large quantities of organic matter and surface soil can detrimentally impact soil quality, most notably on sandy soils. Intensive management practices such as fertilization can improve soil quality and increase site productivity by ameliorating factors Limiting growth. The increased growth rates in intensively managed stands can indirectly improve soil quality by increasing organic matter. The increased production of coarse roots in intensively managed plantations is particularly important in this regard. These changes can lead to long-term improvement in soil quality and site productivity, especially on the degraded soils on which many forest plantations are established.
   Based on the available data, intensive management can be practiced sustainably on many soils. Land classification systems are needed to identify soils that are suitable for intensive management. Site-specific management regimes must then be developed to insure that intensive management is practiced sustainably on these soils. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB New Zealand law requires sustainable forest management. International definitions of sustainability typically include maintaining the productive capacity of forest soils, and decision tools are needed for managing harvesting and site preparation practices. Trials were established between 1986 and 1994 in different physiographic regions of New Zealand to determine the effects of management on the second-rotation performance of Pinus radiata. Main harvesting and residue treatments at three North Island sites include: whole-tree harvest plus forest floor removal, whole-tree harvest, and stem-only harvest retaining a single layer of slash. These treatments were installed in a random block split-plot design (with and without fertiliser). Additional treatments were added at specific sites (e.g., double slash addition at Woodhill; topsoil removal at Tarawera) to test hypotheses that harvesting intensity is negatively correlated with second-rotation growth, that inadequate nutrition is the reason for the negative correlation, and that fertiliser additions can compensate for the negative impact of harvesting on nutrition. Stands were thinned-to-waste to reduce stocking by 50% at Woodhill (age 7 years), Tarawera and Kinleith (age 5 years). On recent coastal sand dunes at Woodhill, foliar analyses suggest that nutrient availability to trees of N, P, K, B, Mn, and Zn were reduced during critical periods of stand establishment by forest floor removal, and improved by retention of thinning slash. Diameter at 5 years declined as forest floor C:N ratio increased. Diameter after 11 years was reduced by forest floor removal, and positively related with residue retention. On approximately 100-year-old basaltic tephra gravel at Tarawera, foliar concentrations of K and B were positively related with slash and soil nutrient retention, however, the effect of harvest removals on tree nutrition and growth was substantially less than observed on recent sand dunes due to greater native fertility of basaltic gravel. Forest floor C:N ratio at Tarawera explained less variation in tree growth than at Woodhill. On the N-rich Taupo sandy loam of Kinleith Forest, there was no correlation between forest floor C:N ratio and tree diameter to age 5 years. Fertiliser additions have increased tree diameter at all sites, and can ameliorate harvesting-related reductions in growth. However, fertiliser additions caused significant reductions in foliar concentrations of most nutrients studied except N. These trials have been useful for identifying the benefits of residue retention among sites with varying levels of native fertility Based on the results of this study, we recommend organic matter retention during harvest and site preparation on N-deficient sites such as Pinaki Typic Sandy Recent Sail.

AB One hundred years of timber harvest and reduced fire frequency have resulted in the conversion of once open stands of ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests to dense forests dominated by Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii). Selection harvest and harvest with prescribed fire have been identified as possible tools to restore ponderosa pine stands to presettlement stand structures. Case studies were performed at three separate sites in western Montana to assess the influence of selection harvest and prescribed burning on soil N dynamics. These sites had been exposed to either selection harvest, selection harvest with prescribed burning, or a no-treatment control 0 (Lubrecht Experimental Forest), 2 (En Ranch), or 11 (Lick Creek Demonstration Site) years prior to initial soil analyses. Replicate soil samples were collected over at least two growing seasons at each site and analyzed for total C and N, potentially mineralizable N (PMN), short-term soil respiration rates, soil microbial biomass N, extractable NH(4)(+) and NO(3)(-), and soluble sugars (measured as 0.5 M K(2)SO(4) extractable anthrone reactive carbon (KARC)). Selection harvest without prescribed burning had little or no influence on levels of available N or microbial activity relative to the control at all three sites. Selection harvest with prescribed fire, however, significantly increased extractable NH(4)(+), NO(3)(-) and KARC immediately following treatment. Such differences were not observed 2 or 11 years following treatment. Potentially mineralizable N was significantly increased immediately following fire, but decreased to levels lower than the control 1 year following treatment. Levels of PMN were also found to be less than the control 2 and 11 years after treatment. Similarly, microbial biomass N was elevated immediately following prescribed burning, but was significantly lower than the control for up to 11 years following prescribed burning. Levels of mineralizable N were lowered within a year of treatment as a result of (1) N loss during soil heating, (2) N loss to plant uptake, and (3) potential leaching losses. The effect of reduced mineralizable N on long-term site productivity is not clear, however, these losses of N from the ecosystem should be considered along with stand mortality and yield when assessing the potential sustainability of forest management strategies.

AB The eastern hardwood forests of the US may be threatened by the changing atmospheric chemistry and by changes in harvesting levels. Many studies have documented accelerated base cation losses with intensive forest harvesting. Acidic deposition can also alter nutrient cycling in these forests. The combination of increased harvesting, shorter rotations, and more intensive harvesting, along with the potential for N and S saturation due to changing atmospheric chemistry in the eastern US, raises concerns about the long-term productivity of these commercially important eastern hardwood forests. We review the literature describing the effects of intensive harvesting and acidic atmospheric deposition on budgets of base nutrients which presents evidence that the ambient levels of N and S deposition are leading to N and S saturation and elevated base leaching from the soil in some eastern forests, and we discuss potential concerns for long-term productivity. We also discuss criteria and indicators for monitoring sustainability of the soils of these forests. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Foresters have always relied on a knowledge of chemical and physical properties of soils to assess capacity of sites to support productive forests. Recently, the need for assessing soil properties has expanded because of growing public interest in determining consequences of management practices on the quality of soil relative to sustainability of forest ecosystem functions in addition to plant productivity. The concept of soil quality includes assessment of soil properties and processes as they relate to ability of soil to function effectively as a component of a healthy ecosystem. Specific functions and subsequent values provided by forest ecosystems are variable and rely on numerous soil physical, chemical, and biological properties and processes, which can differ across spatial and temporal scales. Choice of a standard set of specific properties as indicators of soil quality can be complex and will vary among forest systems and management objectives. Indices of forest soil quality which incorporate soil chemical, physical, and biological properties will be most readily adopted if they are sensitive to management-induced changes, easily measured, relevant across sites or over time, inexpensive, closely linked to measurement of desired values, and adaptable for specific ecosystems. This paper traces development of the concept of soil quality, explores use of soil chemical and physical properties as determinants of forest soil quality, and presents challenges and opportunities for forest soil scientists to play a relevant role in assessment and advancement of sustainable forest management by developing the concept of soil quality as an indicator of sustainability.

AB Long-term agricultural field experiments provide relevant information for questions being asked about the sustainability of managed forests, particularly as management regimes become more intensive. In this paper, concepts and criteria related to sustainable site productivity are reviewed and findings from a range of long-term agricultural field experiments are evaluated. Based on this evaluation, the following site productivity principles are identified: (1) soil organic matter is the Link between most management systems and sustainable site productivity; (2) nutrient deficiencies can be corrected; (3) soil texture is a key variable affecting soil organic matter and site productivity; (4) return of crop residues enhances soil organic matter and site productivity; and (5) productive cropping systems have environmental benefits. While technological advances have proven to be highly successful for enhancing long-term crop yields, they also have the potential to mask underlying declines in site productivity. This hypothesis needs to be rigorously tested.
   Agricultural field experiments show that crop productivity can be sustained for long time periods when appropriate management approaches are applied. Management requirements to achieve sustainability differ, however, depending on site-specific edaphic and climatic characteristics and the needs of the crop. Site productivity principles derived from agricultural field studies are also highly relevant to sustaining site productivity of managed forests. Several characteristics of managed forests should be considered when extrapolating conclusions from agricultural experiments. These include harvest removals of biomass and nutrients, residue type and distribution, management and system characteristics, and soil types used. Many characteristics associated with even intensively managed forests are sought as goals of conservation cropping systems and should contribute toward sustaining long-term site productivity.

AB Quantifying temporal changes in soil temperature and moisture conditions is an important part of characterizing pre- and post-disturbance conditions that influence the health, productivity, and sustainability of forest ecosystems. In this paper, we present an experimental case study that was used to evaluate the ability of the forest hydrology model ForHyM2 to simulate field-observed changes in root-zone soil moisture and temperature, as well as snowpack depth, throughfall volume and forest floor percolate volume, for a jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.) site in northeastern Ontario. The experiment refers to two post-harvest treatment factors, each involving two treatments: (a) blading (removing) or non-blading the forest floor and part of the mineral topsoil, (b) herbiciding or non-herbiciding. It was found that harvesting increased the average daily soil temperature by 4-6 degreesC on all treatment plots during summer (5 cm soil depth). Blading increased the soil temperature further by 1-2 degreesC. Herbiciding did not have significant effects on soil temperature. Eliminating competing forest vegetation significantly increased soil moisture level on the non-bladed treatment plots.
   The model simulations were based on daily precipitation (snow and rain), air temperature, and a few site descriptors such as longitude and latitude, soil depth, soil texture, and leaf area index. The resulting simulations compared well (graphically) with the pre- and post-harvest field observations regarding soil moisture, soil temperature, and snowpack water equivalents. Good graphical agreements suggest that the approach taken with this case study can be applied to the evaluation of soil moisture and temperature conditions to a variety of pre- and post-disturbance forest conditions. The results from the study would be useful for addressing below ground processes such as root growth, soil respiration, rate of organic matter decomposition, rate of soil weathering, nutrient cycling, etc., all of which strongly influence site productivity.

AB Decomposing taproot systems of mature loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) trees harvested 16 years earlier were examined to assess their effects on productivity of a naturally regenerated loblolly pine stand. Productivity by trees within a l-m radius of decomposing stumps was greater than that in zones farther from the stump. Production of the 16-year-old naturally regenerated loblolly pine stand on this eroded Pacolet soil would have been at least 28% less in the absence of decomposing root systems of previously harvested trees. Live-root density of the natural stand within decomposing root systems was about twice that found in soil profiles centered 2 and 4 m distant from the stump. Below a soil depth of 20 cm, decomposing root systems contained significantly higher root densities than the soil matrix. Decomposing root systems provide scattered microsites of enhanced fertility, aeration, and moisture which benefit growth of nearby trees and may play an important role in sustaining and restoring productivity of marginal Piedmont sites.

AB Soil quality standards and guidelines of the USDA Forest Service were some of the first in the world to be developed to evaluate changes in forest soil productivity and sustainability after harvesting and site preparation. International and national development of criteria and indicators for maintenance of soil productivity make it imperative to have adequate threshold variables within the USDA Forest Service. In the Pacific Northwest soils range from fine-textured Andisols to coarse-textured skeletal Inceptisols. Forest types encompass the highly productive coastal rain forest to marginally productive, dry, cold sites in the interior mountains. Constant values to detect detrimental disturbances within the soil quality guidelines are routinely applied across diverse soils and timber types and include diagnostic criteria for evaluating management-caused changes to soil productivity. Research information from short- or long-term research studies supporting the applicability of disturbance criteria is often lacking, or is available from a limited number of sites which have relatively narrow climatic and soil ranges. In this paper we calculated changes in soil carbon, nitrogen, erosion, and cation exchange capacity using threshold variables from the Regional USDA Forest Service Soil Guidelines to assess their applicability across diverse landscapes. Soils were selected from a climatic and elevational gradient in the Pacific Northwest. Application of selected USDA Forest Service standards indicate that blanket threshold variables applied over disparate soils do not adequately account for nutrient distribution within the profile or forest floor depth. These types of guidelines should be continually refined to reflect pre-disturbance conditions and site-specific information. Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Increased emphasis on sustainable resource management in forestry has effectuated a demand for various nontimber values. Nonconsumptive wildlife recreation is an important nontimber service produced on forest and rangeland. Travel cost models and data from the 1991 National Survey of Fishing, Hunting and Wildlife-Associated Recreation are used to estimate the demand and value for nonconsumptive wildlife-associated recreation in the United States. Resulting welfare measures are shown to be sensitive to assumptions about the cost of travel time, pecuniary costs, and functional form. Consumer surplus estimates range from 18.7 to 327.5 dollars per trip, while aggregate estimates of consumer surplus resulting from access to nonconsumptive wildlife recreation range from 5.8 to 66.4 billion dollars annually. Availability of information about nonparticipants allows comparison of truncated and untruncated demand models. Contrary to previous findings, consumer surplus estimates from truncated models are smaller than for untruncated counterparts. Trip demand is found to be adversely affected by per capita decreases in forest and rangeland. Models include interaction variables to avoid forcing hunting or fishing as potential substitutes for the large number of people who do not hunt or fish. Hunting and nonconsumptive wildlife recreation are complementary activities, while the results for fishing are mixed.

AB Objective measures of forest ecosystem condition are needed to gauge the effects of management activities and natural phenomena on sustainability. The Bioindicators of Forest Condition Project seeks to develop a Forest Condition Rating (FCR) system using a physiological, remote sensing approach. In particular, the goal of the project is to test whether hyperspectral remote sensing may be used to infer stand-level information about pigment concentration, chlorophyll fluorescence, and other physiological features of condition. The project spans a four-year period of intensive sampling in tolerant hardwood forests in Ontario using the Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI). For each airborne campaign, concurrent ground-based sampling for leaf physiological features was performed. Controlled laboratory and greenhouse studies were also conducted to derive relationships between leaf-based spectral measurements and physiology in the presence of environmental stresses. The project has identified several promising bioindicators of strain that are discernible from hyperspectral images and related to ground-based physiology. The most promising remote indicator for semi-operational testing is estimation of chlorophyll content, which can be used to classify maple stands on a five-stage scale of health. Chlorophyll fluorescence has also been discerned from spectral signatures, but our studies indicate it may be confounded by chlorophyll content. The intent here is to update the forestry community on progress made, insights gained, and the practical implications of the research.

AB A preliminary conceptual design on high performance dual-cooled blanket of fusion-driven transmuter is presented based on neutronic calculation. The dual-cooled system has some attractive advantages when utilized in transmutation of HLW (High Level Wastes). The calculation results show that this kind of blanket could safely transmute about 6 ton minor actinides (produced by 170 GW(e) Year PWRs approximately) and 0.4 ton fission products per year, and output 12 GW thermal power. In addition, the variation of power and critical factor of this blanket is relatively little during its 1-year operation period. This blanket is also tritium self-sustainable.

ID INTEGRATED ASSESSMENT; CLIMATE-CHANGE; PERSPECTIVE
AB In this paper, we argue that one way to address the concept of a sustainable Europe is through the use of scenarios. To that end, we discuss the current state-of-the-art in scenario development, both from a methodological point of view, as well as in terms of a review of existing scenarios that address the notion of sustainable development in a European context. We identify a number of deficiencies in current scenario studies, both in general and for European scenarios in particular. We then discuss the VISIONS project, which aims to develop visions for a sustainable Europe, taking the challenges into account that are derived from the identified weaknesses. Finally, the draft scenarios for Europe as they have been developed in the first year of the VISIONS project are presented. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper considers the development of a particular cultural industry, the indigenous film and television production sector, in a specific locality, Vancouver (British Columbia, Canada). Vancouver's film and television industry exhibits a high level of dependency on the location shooting of US funded productions, a relatively mobile form of foreign investment capital. As such, the development of locally developed and funded projects is crucial to the long-term sustainability of the industry. The key facilitators of growth in the indigenous sector are a small group of independent producers that are attempting to develop their own projects within a whole series of constraints apparently operating at the local, national and international levels. At the international level, they are situated within a North American cultural industry where the funding, production, distribution and exhibition of projects is dominated by US multinationals. At the national level, both government funding schemes and broadcaster purchasing patterns favour the larger production companies of central Canada. At the local level, producers have to compete with the demands of US productions for crew, locations and equipment. I frame my analysis within notions of the embeddedness or embodiment of social and economic relations, and suggest that the material realities of processes operating at the three inter-linked scales, are effectively embodied in a small group of individual producers and their inter-personal networks.

AB The development of information and communications technologies (ICT) has facilitated the emergence of a complex global urban system in which many formerly lower-order cities have been carving out "niche" specialist functions serving urban fields of transnational dimension. This is illustrated in the case of Dublin, which in recent years has been transcending its traditional role as Ireland's national metropolis through the development of a range of functions servicing mainly European markets. One such function comprises pan-European telephone call centre operations. The development and characteristics of this newly-emerging sector are described. It is argued that the growth of the sector confirms Dublin's - and Ireland's - dependent position in the international division of labour, and that its long-term sustainability is open to question.

   aquifer system
SO GROUND WATER

ID WASHINGTON; RECHARGE
AB Ongoing decline of water levels in the confined basalt aquifers of the Pullman-Moscow Basin of Washington and Idaho has prompted study of the timing, amount and distribution of recharge to the system. Previous radiocarbon ages indicate residence times on the order of 10(3) years and greater and suggest a low rate of recharge to the lower basalt aquifer since the end of Pleistocene time. By contrast, more recent hydrodynamic flow modeling studies invoke a larger Holocene recharge rate through the unconfined loess unit to the upper and lower basalt aquifers, which implies relatively short residence times (10(2) years). Stable isotopes were used to independently assess contrasting recharge models by comparing O-18/O-16 and D/H ratios of late-Holocene shallow ground water and deep ground water. Linear regression of local precipitation ratios yields deltaD = 6.9 delta O-18 - 18.4. There is no evidence of fractionation of ground water ratios by recharge processes or water-rock interactions. Deep basalt ground water delta O-18 values are depleted by 0.4 to 4.9 per mil relative to shallow, recently recharged ground waters and have delta O-18 values statistically distinct from waters sampled from other stratigraphic units. These findings suggest that the deep waters in the basin were not precipitated under current climate conditions and that aquifer recharge rates to the deep basalt aquifer are substantially lower than have been recently estimated. This in turn suggests that a sustainable ground water exploitation scheme must reduce reliance on the deep ground water resource.

TI The sustainability of the ancient Great Dam of Ma'rib in Yemen
SO ICID JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB The research in Southern Arabia during the last two decades has revealed an indiginous hydraulic culture. The Yemeni flood water irrigation system is capable to manage plenty of water. An earthen deflector dam conducts a part of the sayl into a canal system. Large: fields are flooded knee-deep. This soaks the soil enough to produce a yield.
   The famous Great Dam of Ma'rib functioned in the same manner. The earth dam, up to 20 m high, 620 m long and at its base about 100 m wide, raised the water to the level of the fields. Two sluices on each end of the dam served as entrances to the primary canals. A network of rectangular arranged secondary canals distributed the water on the oasis. Irrigation was immediate in the above described way. Surplus water was conducted back to the wadi by massive built overflows.
   The safety of the system was given by a wide spillway, an overflow at the South Sluice regulating the amount of water entering the primary canal and by the weak dam which was washed away by extraordinary big floods.
   A discussion leads to the conclusion that the Sabean oasis was irrigated in a real sustainable manner. The best proof is given by the long existence of the arrangement. The Sabeans faced only one severe problem; the silting up of the fields by an average of about 1 cm/ year. At the end the Great Dam was used by the Sabeans to conduct the sayl into another wadi. The reason for this was to evade the highest part of the oasis. The rapidly built dam system of al-Mabna caught the water on the north side of the oasis. From here a safe supply of the area around the capital was still possible.
   The new dam of Ma'rib and its appertaining irrigation is presented in a brief description. The comparison between the old and the new dam shows the many disadvantages of the latter and leads to conclusions about facts that must be regarded when planning an irrigation system.

AB Technology can induce changes. By the introduction of paddy cultivation in Japan, together with irrigation technology and iron tools, the primitive society of hunting and gathering was transformed into a modernized state with taxation system. Since the introduction of the technology, paddy fields have been cultivated in a sustainable manner for more than 2,500 years. This paper describes the process of technology transfer and associated changes as well as its implications, covering mainly three aspects; technology transfer and innovation, taxation and incentives, and sustainability of agricultural production. Lessons can be learnt by studying the history, and solutions could be identified to the problems that we are facing today.

TI Sustainable water management in the Netherlands by water boards
SO ICID JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB The main issue of the future: scarcity of water opposed to an ever growing demand in its turn creates two problems that are not new. On the contrary, scarcity leads to tension and conflicts and in due time impedes economic progress and the reduction of poverty. The inhabitants of The Netherlands faced exactly these two problems when fighting the abundance of water in their country throughout the centuries.
   In making the country inhabitable, constant care was demanded. The inhabitants, although all wishing safety and dry feet, did not all have equal interest in obtaining these aims. If more than one individual wants to have maximum profit of drainage facilities, he inevitably will prevent others from maximising their benefits. This is why harmonisation of interests, conflict-resolution and monitoring are of the highest importance. The Dutch have entrusted these cares to special public bodies, so-called water boards that were created about a thousand years ago and have survived untill the present day.
   This article addresses the variety of institutions as both written and oral rules that were designed over the centuries to set up and maintain the local and regional water management. The administrators of the water boards have designed all kind of rules applying both to the members inhabitants as well as to themselves. Rules defining rights and duties of the board were rules defining the frontiers of the territory and the limits to use of hydraulic structures, rules for O & M, rules for monitoring and against rule breaking and rules for an equitable system for fees and profits. Rules defining rules and duties of the inhabitants were voting rights, share in say, right to complain and lodge objections. The essential point in this multitude of rules is the principle of reciprocity. At the end of this article, a number of recommendations will be presented to realise favorable conditions allowing the creation or resurrection of likewise sustainable institutions elsewhere.

AB In systems where production of a commodity or service is accompanied by simultaneous generation of detriments, reduction of the latter usually implies increase in production cost. This leaves considerable scope for sustainable decisions regarding the extent to which control of detriments can be done in a cost effective manner. One example of such a system is production of power over an energy management scenario, where control of pollution from thermal units attracts considerable interest due to the environmental and economic implications.
   This paper presents an approach that decides the optimality for cost effective control of detriments accompanying a production process, The total burden on the production system is viewed in terms of two components, namely, a cost burden and a detriment burden; both considered relative to their values for the base case, which incorporates no control for detriments. The cost effective decision is obtained as an optimal tradeoff between the two burdens.
   The concept is formulated for the general production planning system, as well as for application to an energy management scenario. An illustrative case study adapted from the existing Indian energy scenario is used to highlight the applicability of the approach.

TI Decentralization of intertemporal economies with discounted maximin
   criterion
SO INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
ID PLANS
AB The intertemporal decentralization literature scrutinizes the ability of markets to achieve dynamically optimal allocation of resources. Put differently, it examines the possibility of designing a mechanism enabling short-lived agents to make independent decisions compatible with long-run optimum. The Hurwicz and Weinberger impossibility result states that the mechanisms that are both privacy preserving and optimal fail to exist when an infinite-horizon optimum is defined by Ramsey-type criteria with discounting. However, for a special case where the economy cannot sustain growth and agents do not discount future utilities, it is known that a decentralized mechanism using rolling plans is in a certain sense asymptotically optimal. To address the: problem of possibility of decentralization mechanisms in a sustainable growth economy with discounting, I consider a "discounted maximin" optimality criterion. It selects the programs that sustain growth of welfare at a given rate. The paper argues that this criterion is consistent with the principles of intergenerational justice, which can be defined in terms of intergenerational Nash equilibrium. Furthermore, the paper demonstrates that a decentralized mechanism designed on the basis of rolling plans generates decisions that are asymptotically optimal in terms of the discounted maximin.

TI Long-term yield patterns in barley-based cropping systems in Northern
   Syria. 3. Barley monocropping
SO JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
ID ON-FARM TRIALS; NITROGEN; LEGUMES
AB Results from monocropped barley treatments in long-term rotation (RTN) and continuous barley (CB) trials at two sites were examined for fertilizer effects on yield means and long-term yield trends. In RTN trials, mean responses to fertilizer (N:P2O5) applied annually at rates of 20:60 at the drier and 40:60 at the wetter site were almost double those from biennial application, confirming the need for annual fertilization in monocropped barley systems. In CB trials, with N and P applied annually in nine factorial combinations, at rates up to 120:90, responses to each nutrient were curvilinear and dependent on the presence of the other nutrient. Trend analysis showed a decline in grain yields over time where NP fertilizer had not been applied or applied only at low annual rates (< 60:45 or < 60:90, according to site); but straw yields, at worst, remained approximately stable in the absence of fertilizer and generally increased strongly with higher NP rates. Uncertainties in the interpretation of trend-analysis results indicate the need for methodology improvements, to include (i) additional single-value parameters of the growth environment, to improve the model's ability to account for seasonal variability, and (ii) a more flexible, non-linear function for time.
   It was concluded that barley monocropping is not necessarily non-sustainable in the medium term: provided adequate annual fertilization is maintained; but risks of pest or disease build-up, in addition to the superiority of legume-barley systems in biomass and crude protein output demonstrated in preceding papers, undoubtedly favour the introduction of some forage legumes into long-term barley sequences. The most practicable (and acceptable) systems may well be ones in which continuous barley is interrupted by a legume, or even a bare fallow, every third or fourth year. Above all, farmers should be helped to experiment with different forage legumes, barley-legume sequences, and modes of legume harvest, to optimize outputs in relation to their evolving and individual enterprise needs.

AB This paper develops a meta-theory of business based on virtue theory which links the concept of virtues, the common good, and the dynamic economy into a unifying and comprehensive theory of business. Traditional theories and models of business have outlived their usefulness as they are unable to adequately explain social reality. Virtue theory shows firms that pursue ethically-driven strategies can realise a greater profit potential than those firms who currently use profit-driven strategies. The theory expounds that the business of business is ethical business and that the crises that business and society face today are crises of leadership and ethics. The issues of leadership and corporate social responsibility are discussed in the context of the proposed theory.

DE renewable resource; heterogeneous preference; dynamics; sustainability
AB In recent years there has been increasing interest in the study of economic sustainability and its relationship with natural resources. This paper attempts to shed some light on the issue by taking into account the individual variations in time preferences for consumption and resource amenity. We characterize the long-run steady state, analyze its asymptotic stability, and explore the transational dynamics from any initial state. The welfare implications of the optimal path are also discussed. (C) 2000 Academic Press.

TI Biodegradation assessment of woolscour sludge and fellmongery sludge
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY
LA English
DT Article
ID SEWAGE-SLUDGE; NITROGEN; SOIL; RELEASE
AB Sustainable land application of agricultural and industrial wastes requires an understanding of factors likely to Limit waste decomposition and the release of plant-available nitrogen. This paper describes the biodegradation of a woolscour sludge and a fellmongery sludge and suggests a biodegradation assessment strategy suitable for agricultural and industrial wastes. After 50 d of decomposition in microcosms, the woolscour sludge mineralized 18% of initial C and 9% of initial N, while the fellmongery sludge mineralized 37% of initial C and 53% of initial N. Set N mineralization from woolscour sludge was principally constrained by the recalcitrant behaviour of the wool fiber component, whereas elevated temperature (43 degreesC) or anaerobic conditions constrained fellmongery sludge decomposition. Two negative consequences of soil amendment were identified. First, soil amended with fellmongery sludge leached up to 39% of applied sludge N as mineral N during 100 d of decomposition Second, both sludges caused a reduction in microbial biomass (MB) after 1 yr of soil amendment. Our data indicated that the woolscour sludge was a substrate of low quality for soil microbial metabolism and that chemical parameters are a poor predictor of biodegradation. On the other hand, the fellmongery sludge was a substrate of moderately high quality for which chemical characteristics permitted relatively consistent prediction of N mineralization.

ID WORK
AB The focus of this paper is on developing "quality" and sustainable construction businesses capable of riding market shifts and growing both nationally and internationally. Knowledge of current management tools and techniques will no doubt prove useful in the quest for transforming a nonperforming business. However, no long lasting effect can be expected unless attention is paid to the fundamental principles and practices that govern organizational behavior, including the views an organization has of its customers, competitors, and itself. Commercial performance of organizations has increasingly become not only dependent on resource efficiency, but also on retooling and aggressive new business development initiatives as well as reduction in base production and operational costs. The human factors and mental models that people have within any given organization profoundly affect the success or failure of that organization. In this paper a critical review of the current concepts and techniques influencing construction organizations is offered with a focus on people and organizational improvements. A set of critical success factors is then distilled, followed by a systematic process of applying the same to achieve success.

AB Awareness in Central and Eastern European countries of environmental problems is growing rapidly. Yet the social, economic: and political barriers to implementing drastic policy measures are still formidable. The acceptability of policy measures can be improved when the environmental and economic implications of alternative measures are shown in conjunction. Therefore, a prototype Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model is constructed for Lithuania. A key question in Lithuania concerns the future use of nuclear-generated power. Using the CGE model, medium-term scenarios describing combinations of high or low economic activity, fuel prices, and nuclear potential are run for the year 2000.

AB Experiments were conducted to compare changes in quality of slices of red tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill. 'Sunbeam') fruit from plants grown using black polyethylene or hairy vetch mulches under various foliar disease management systems including: no fungicide applications (NF), a disease forecasting model (TOM-CAST), and weekly fungicide applications (WF), during storage at 5 degreesC under a modified atmosphere. Slices were analyzed for firmness, soluble solids content (SSC), titratable acidity (TA), pH, electrolyte leakage, fungi, yeasts, and chilling injury. With both NF and TOM-CAST fungicide treatments, slices from tomatoes grown with hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth) mulch were firmer than those from tomatoes grown with black polyethylene mulch after 12 days storage. Ethylene production of slices from fruit grown using hairy vetch mulch under TOM-CAST was approximate to1.5- and 5-fold higher than that of slices from WF and NF fungicide treatments after 12 days, respectively, The percentage of water-soaked areas (chilling injury) for slices from tomatoes grown using black polyethylene mulch under NF was over 7-fold that of slices from tomatoes grown using hairy vetch under TOM-CAST. When stored at 20 degreesC, slices from light-red tomatoes grown with black polyethylene or hairy vetch mulches both showed a rapid increase in electrolyte leakage beginning 6 hours after slicing. However, slices from tomatoes grown using the hairy vetch mulch tended to have lower electrolyte leakage than those grown with black polyethylene mulch. These results suggest that tomatoes from plants grown using hairy vetch mulch may be more suitable for fresh-cut slices than those grown using black polyethylene mulch. Also, use of the disease forecasting model TOM-CAST, which can result in lower fungicide application than is currently used commercially, resulted in high quality fruit for fresh-cut processing.

AB Education plays a critical role in realizing sustainable development and promoting the capability of the people to address environmental/developmental issues. On the verge of the 21st Century, educational reforms and development are placed at a high priority in many countries. In the Asia-Pacific region, a project called "Learning for a Sustainable Environment Innovations in Teacher Education through Environmental Education" initiated by UNESCO-ACEID has contributed towards the promotion of environmental education, specifically comprehensive one in school. It is also evident that science/chemistry is one of the most important subjects in dealing with environmental education. The relationship between human life and the environment can logically be explained through scientific/chemical skills and knowledge. Accordingly it is required that some chemistry-oriented teaching materials on comprehensive environmental education be effectively implemented in school.
   Chemical treatment of waste material and wastewater generated in school laboratories can be the appropriate teaching material for environmental chemistry education, because the treatment involves some typically important chemical reactions such as precipitation, neutralization, oxidation-reduction, and so on. Some reaction cycles for recovering several chemical compounds from wastewater involving iron, manganese, copper and so on are useful to secondary school chemistry as well as introductory general chemistry at colleges and universities. It is important to develop chemical recycling systems for such metallic ions in school laboratories and to introduce the principle of recycling as a practice of environmental protection by students themselves. Such an approach enables students to understand chemical reactions involved and the role of chemistry in preserving our environment,, which may in turn lead to environ mentally responsible attitudes and actions in their daily lives.

ID SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB The failure of the command and control approach to fisheries management has encouraged governments to look for new ways of balancing the requirement to conserve fish stocks and yet maintain a flow of benefits that will meet economic and social targets. In the quest to establish a system for sustaining production in the Common Pond, the European Union (EU) has begun to investigate alternatives to the current management system. This research paper examines the problems associated with the current management regime operating in the EU in the light of alternatives for managing the fisheries. The research seeks to establish whether, given the serious problems confronting the EU's fishing industries, fishermen would be prepared to accept change and offer their ideas and support to develop an alternative management system. The research draws on the opinions of fishermen from Shetland and discusses the findings gained from interviewing key informants in conjunction with the results of an opinion survey of skippers and boat owners.

AB This paper presents a concise historic overview of the establishment and pathways of development of mathematical geology. Its very existence is largely due to the activity of Russian geologist Prof. Vistelius (1915-1995) who was the first president of the International Association of Mathematical Geology. Presented are important facts of biography of A, B Vistelius, as well as the history of his scientific investigations. It is elucidated that in the USSR, mathematical geology, like genetics or cybernetics, was hardly accepted by the ideology that dominated at that time from tis very appearance in the 40s. Both mathematical geology and its creator could not be squeezed into the tight limits of the Soviet ideology. But the difficulties only benefited his bright individuality and hardened his style of scientific reasoning, leadership, and fight for purity of science. Vistelius believed that mathematical geology would be the paradigm for geoscience in the 21st century. It is ascertained that the scientific ideology of conceptual modeling of geologic processes and objects suggested by Vistelius has totally proved itself. However, its further propagation is impeded by those geologists whose thinking is traditional and whose paradigm is old. This situation must be changed to enter the coming century equipped with economically reliable concepts ensuring sustainable development. It could be unprofitable and even dangerous to ignore the concepts developed by Prof. Vistelius. This paper focuses on the principal ideas of Prof. Vistelius and detailed large-scale program of development of mathematical geology in the foreseeable future. This program is fulfilled in the Institute of Mathematical Geology (IMAG) of the Russian Academy of Natural Sciences, founded by Prof. Vistelius.

AB The poverty-stricken mountain areas in South Central China face many challenges on the road to sustainable development in the 21st century. Great progress has been made in alleviating poverty in the past decade: while 15 million people in these areas suffered from extreme poverty in 1989, this number decreased to about 6 million by 1996. Cereal production during the same period increased from 50 to 397 kg per capita. But to break away from poverty and raise the standard of living, the region must now enter a new stage of development. It needs to benefit from the transition taking place from a planned economy to a market economy, especially with respect to new domestic market conditions. There is also a need to raise awareness of the requirements for sustainable development strategies in mountain areas. This will involve industrialization of agriculture, increasing the quality of products in the primary and secondary sectors, developing the service sector, improving infrastructure for transport and trade, and letting the market determine resource use rather than vice versa. The following introduction to the region and its problems is complemented by recommendations for enhancement of economic strategies in the mountain areas shared by Chongqing Municipality and the provinces of Hubei, Hunan, and Guizhou and linked by the Yangtze and its tributaries.

However, reserves established in developing countries, such as the Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve in India, are facing management versus people conflicts due to the insensitivity of management to both genuine and irrational demands coming from people who are motivated by potential economic benefits. The present case study focuses on the issue of crop and livestock depredation by wildlife as a major source of conflict. Feasible solutions in the given socioeconomic context are outlined here; some of these are being tested by the authors in the study area. The results are expected to provide more sustainable livelihood measures and stimulate greater participation in conservation programs.

AB The regional land use system in northern Pakistan is based on irrigated rop cultivation on valley floors combined with animal husbandry and forest utilization in the upper altitudinal belts. Local communities subsist on this agropastoral economy to a considerable extent. Environmental conditions and the ecological risks of resource utilization are intimately linked in this high mountain region. Rapid population growth, a corresponding increase in pressure on natural resources, and the consequent danger of environmental degradation raise questions about sustainable resource management in relation to contemporary land use and land cover change. The present study investigates vegetation changes and the development of-land use patterns in the Nanga Parbat region (Northwest Himalaya) using matched pairs of photographs. A comprehensive collection of historical landscape photographs, taken by members of the German Himalaya expeditions of 1934 and 1937, forms a valuable baseline data set for the area. Recent fieldwork made it possible to reproduce a number of these photographs from viewpoints identical to the earlier ones. Direct comparisons illustrate change and persistence in the cultural landscape over a span of 60 years. The development of the cultural landscape is characterized by the enlargement of settlements and the expansion of cultivated areas in most valleys. On a local scale, intensified irrigation has fed to an increase of groundwater-dependent thickets along the water channels and below the cultivated terraces. The montane coniferous forests are characterized by gradual decline, though change is drastic in some places due to local overexploitation. The submontane Pinus gerardiana and Juniperus semiglobosa forests in the vicinity of the villages and near the lower timberline have been seriously degraded.

AB The influence of reindeer pasturing on high mountain ecosystems in northern Norway was investigated using a landscape-ecological analysis. The most visible impacts of overgrazing are On the vegetation. In addition, soils and humus have been changed due to morphodynamic processes induced to a large extent by reindeer pasturing. Degradation of the high mountain landscapes within the last 30 years is described on 3 spatial levels: large-scale effects at specific localities, linear effects along reindeer fences, and small-scale effects on the altitudinal zonation of entire mountain systems. The structure of the ecosystem ha changed completely due to reindeer pasturing, which has resulted in landscape degradation under great pasturing pressure. The processes that influence the ecosystem as a function of different pasture intensities are described and show a complex correlation and interaction between the ecofactors. These include destruction of vegetation cover, reduction of roof density, erosion of humus and mineral soil horizons, reduction of soil moisture and soil stability, and changes in plant species composition. On the whole, degradation leads to a depression of the altitudinal belts, indicated by the new organization of the ecosystems. It can be concluded that reindeer herding at current levels is a destructive form of land use in the northern Norwegian high mountains and hence is not sustainable. The author believes that destruction of the natural environment could be reversed, although this is not to be expected.

DE waves; pump; resonance; coastal management
AB Flume experiments with a scale-model of a wave driven seawater pump in monochromatic waves are described. A tuning mechanism optimises the pump performance by keeping it at resonance with the waves. The pumping process itself was found to de-tune the system because of the reduced gravity restoring force due to spilling in the compression chamber. A perturbation analysis of the pump equations shows that performance of the system can be increased by optimising the shape of the pump intake to minimise losses due to vortex formation. An algorithm is derived, using a numerical model of the pump, which accurately determines the required volume of air in the compression chamber to induce resonance given variations in the wave frequency, the wave height and the tides. A sustainable development project to use a seawater pump to manage fisheries at a coastal lagoon in Mexico is described. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Soil knowledge and care have apparently lost most of their importance for french agriculture during the last decades. This was due to the agronomy and industry success in fertility management, water management and mechanisation. Nowadays changes in economic conditions and agriculture policy, environment issues and seek for sustainability are generating a reverse trend More precise and exhaustive informations on soil properties and their spatial variations become necessary to face the new challenges for agriculture: saving costs, improving products qualities, reducing pollutions, protecting biodiversity and preventing long terme soil degradations. New tools are also required to use this more complex amount of informations in an efficient way. Modelling, data bases and CIS have to be linked in decision helping systems. For farmers technical assessment, land planning and policy decision making at different scales. Soil knowledge and data, bases must be integrated in such systems in France. Availables geographic soil data bases are for too poor to answer these needs. New programmes are developed to complete a national soil data base with a multiscale purpose and set up a soil quality observation network.

AB This paper reports the successful outcome of case studies using integrated crop management (ICM) with a view to attaining sustainable, safe and economic practices for European farmers and growers. Examples are the adoption of 6-m conservation headlands to allow the use of selective herbicides for the control of problem weeds, whilst leaving non-competitive species as a habitat and food source for diverse fauna; a computerised warning system for the control of Phytophthora infestans in the Netherlands, enabling fewer fungicide applications; a computer model (Colibri) which allows French farmers and advisers to forecast development of Sitobion avenae populations in order to predict optimal dates for treatment and recommendations for achieving control of Myzus persicae in peaches grown in Italy which results in least harm to beneficial insects.
   Lower inputs have often resulted in more cost-effective programmes accompanied by less environmental impact, while support for farmers and growers by well-trained staff has proved to be an important factor contributing to successful outcome of the various projects.

   diseases; smallholders
AB Integrated crop management (ICM) goes beyond integrated pest management (IPM) in taking a more holistic approach that incorporates crop protection activities as an aspect of crop husbandry and as part of the overall farm management plan. This encourages farmers to consider the pest management benefits of sound crop husbandry and soil nutrient management, so that the use of commercial pesticides is a last resort, but when their use is necessary it is fully integrated with cultural practices. Viewed in this way, ICM has much to offer agriculture in Africa, which is still largely based on smallholdings. However, the ICM concept as it is applied in developed countries will require careful adaptation to the needs of smallholder agriculture in the developing world. The most significant difference between the two levels of agrarian development is that in Western Europe and to some extent North America, food production is in surplus, whereas in Africa the need is still to maximise food production per hectare. Environmental concerns cannot therefore be a central component of an ICM system that will be acceptable to an African smallholder. The first requirement if ICM is to be adopted in Africa is that it should deliver yield increases and also that the crop production increases are sustainable. Practices that pollute the environment or deplete the resource base are not ICM-compatible. Smallholder coffee in Malawi is taken as a case study to illustrate the contribution that an ICM approach could make to sustainable increases in crop production.

AB Integrated crop management (ICM) balances the issues of profitability and sustainability with the need for concern for the environmental as a whole. As such, it requires sound decision-making based on detailed knowledge of the integrated nature of farming and how any single activity can impact on the business viability (short- and long-term) and on the environment.
   This paper reports the development and use of a practical software package, Environmental Management for Agriculture (EMA), designed to support farmers, advisers and others in developing ICM practices. An exercise in technology transfer, the package uses a simple, but effective, technique relying on input data and information readily available on farm or stored in the system's databases. The paper explains how EMA can support ICM, provides an analysis of the identified user-groups and an insight into how the package is being used by these different groups. It also discusses advantages and disadvantages of using software tools in ICM decision making. (C) 2000 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB The energetic costs of swimming at the surface (swimming) and swimming underwater (diving) are compared in tufted ducks (Aythya fuligula) and three species of penguins, the gentoo (Pygoscelis papua), the king (Aptenodytes patagonicus), and the emperor (Aythya forsteri). Ducks swim on the surface and use their webbed feet as paddles, whereas penguins tend to swim just below the surface and use their flippers as hydrofoils, the latter being much more efficient. Penguins are more streamlined in shape. Thus, the amount of energy required to transport a given mass of bird a given distance (known as the cost of transport) is some two to three times greater in ducks than in penguins. Ducks are also very buoyant, and overcoming the force of buoyancy accounts for 60% and 85% of the cost of descent and remaining on the bottom, respectively, in these birds. The energy cost of a tufted duck diving to about 1.7 m is similar to that when it is swimming at its maximum sustainable speed at the surface (i. e., approximately 3.5 times the value when resting on water). Nonetheless, because of the relatively short duration of its dives, the tufted duck dives well within its calculated aerobic dive limit (cADL, usable O-2 stores per rate of O-2 usage when underwater). However, these three species of penguins have maximum dive durations ranging from 5 min to almost 16 min and maximum dive depths from 155 to 530 m. When these birds dive, they have to metabolise at no more than when resting in water in order for cADL to encompass the duration of most of their natural dives. In gentoo and king penguins, there is a fall in abdominal temperature during bouts of diving; this may reduce the oxygen requirements in the abdominal region, thus enabling dive duration to be extended further than would otherwise be the case.

AB In this paper we present several concepts related to integrated analysis of societal metabolism across scales. First we introduce the concept of "dynamic energy budget" of human societies, which is based on the distinction between exosomatic and endosomatic energy flows and the possibility of establishing autocatalytic loops (egg-chicken patterns) among them. Second, we discuss the nature of the dramatic changes that the industrial revolution induced on the characteristics of societal metabolism. Finally, we discuss methodological problems related to the representation of complex adaptive systems. Dealing with sustainability of human societies requires the parallel use of non-equivalent descriptive domains. This, in turn, requires the ability of "scaling up and down" when moving across levels handling parallel non-reducible assessments.

AB The crucial challenge for integrated analyses of socioeconomic systems is keeping coherence in their multidimensional representation. Our approach describes the hierarchical structure of socioeconomic systems using the profile of allocation of "human activity" over a set of compartments defined at different hierarchical levels (e.g., whole countries, economic sectors, individual households). Compartments are characterized in terms of intensive variables ("intensity" of both "exosomatic energy flows" and "added value flows" per unit of human activity) and the extensive variable "Total Human Activity" <-- --> "population." In this way, relations of congruence across hierarchical levels can be used to link non-equivalent analyses. That is, changes in demographic variables, economic variables, technical coefficients, indices of environmental loading, institutional settings, and social aspirations are no longer independent of each-other even if described within different scientific disciplines.

AB This paper presents empirical data to validate two points. (1) hn integrated analysis of societal metabolism bridges an economic view of changes in socioeconomic systems with a biophysical representation of them. To obtain this check, it compares a biophysical indicator of development BEP with 24 traditional indicators of material economic development. The comparison covers a sample of 107 countries of the world, comprising more than 90% of the total world population (year 1993). (2) The concept of societal metabolism is useful to make biophysical analysts aware of constraints implied by "economic viability" and to make economic analysts aware of constraints implied by "biophysical viability." To prove this point three practical examples of misunderstanding in the field of sustainability analysis are discussed.

AB There are over 200 definitions of 'sustainable development'. But if defining it is difficult, putting it into practice is even harder. This paper reviews what 'sustainability' and 'sustainable development' actually means in real-world terms and discusses the practical challenge it represents. In particular, the paper identifies the interdependencies of environmental, social and economic sustainability. The five available 'capitals' for human progress-natural, human, social, manufactured and financial-are also discussed, the conclusion being that our natural capital (the Earth) is the principal source of wealth from which all others flow.

AB In the first 20 years or so of the new century, the UK could start generating electricity from offshore marine current turbines and new buildings will start to integrate photovoltaics into their roofs and facades. This paper shows how these exciting technologies could enable civil engineers to provide clean, renewable electricity for consumers all over the world-including those currently without electricity. It will also create new jobs-but not in the UK unless the Government's preoccupation with preserving traditional industries is replaced by forward-looking and long-term initiatives.

AB Environmentalists tell us that improving energy efficiency will lead to a reduction in energy consumption whereas economists are convinced that the opposite will occur. This paper claims that the goal should be fewer carbon dioxide emissions not less energy use, which requires development of non-fossil fuel sources,The promotion of energy efficiency should thus not be to reduce energy consumption but to produce a higher quality of life and enable society to fund the transition to a greener and move sustainable future.

AB Integrated transport is not about what sort of transport people want, it is about what sort of city and countryside they want-close-knit friendly streets or suburban sprawl,This paper contends that sustainable transport is achievable but expresses the concern that the civil engineering profession could be more a hindrance than help. It concludes that if we continue to see major road projects as the natural order and all other transport projects as too small, too green or too unworldly, we will be left behind and will have missed the point.

AB Water companies have a pivotal role in the delivery of sustainable development. In providing safe drinking water, supplying water to industry and commerce and treating wastewater before returning it safely to the environment, they are also at the forefront in dealing with the impact of climate change. As explained in this paper, when dealing with something as complex as the global climate, we cannot wait for a perfect model to find solutions to the problems that we could soon be facing. It is vital to ensure that all water resource development plans, whether from the water companies or the regulators, are robust against a range of possible future climates.

AB Major construction companies typically have many thousands of suppliers and are thus at the forefront of delivering sustainable construction. This paper reports on an environmental supply-chain management initiative in Carillion pie, which has demonstrated that the Government's recommendations in this regard are both achievable and commercially beneficial. However, considering environmental issues alone is not sufficient-broader social and ethical issues need to be addressed before we can deliver truly sustainable construction solutions.

AB This paper presents a proposed new methodology for the integration of end of life issues into the design of new chemical plant. The methodology includes methods relating to business strategy, engineering management and engineering design. They are intended to allow organizations to develop awareness of the decommissioning issues relevant to design and to implement preventative measures. Such measures have the potential to reduce the whole-life costs and impacts of chemical plant projects by eliminating, reducing or mitigating the costs and environmental impacts associated with future decommissioning.

AB As a result of the UK Government's waste policy, which increasingly encourages sustainable development, and the realisation that water in the UK cannot be treated as an unlimited resource, there is growing interest in reducing the demand for water by industry. A series of industrial waste minimisation clubs have been set up within the country. This paper identifies the effectiveness of these clubs in reducing the demand for water. An overview of some of the clubs show how there is a major discrepancy between potential and implemented water savings, whilst a more detailed analysis of three specific examples show how water demand and cost to the company can be reduced, with the project paying for itself within around 1 year. It appears that companies are able to reduce water consumption by approximately 30%. If this level of saving was taken up by the entire industrial sector in England and Wales, water consumption could be reduced by approximately 1500 M1/day. This reduction would be more significant in regions of lower rainfall, for example East Anglia and Southeast England. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Organizing sustainable development: From diffusion to translation
SO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Policy changes towards global sustainable development have important consequences for how these policies are organized. New and alternative models of organizing tend to emphasize indirect control rather than direct control and supervision. However, our understanding of their effects and consequences is not very well elaborated. The purpose of this paper is to develop an understanding of specific characteristics and effects of organizing alternative environmental policies towards sustainable development. The paper is based on a field study of the latest attempt in Sweden to work towards sustainable development. Ln 1998, the Swedish government formulated a programme for local investments aiming at positive environmental effects and increased employment rates. Ln this article, we have posed more general questions on how to understand and to theorize upon the organizing of sustainable development. We suggest a view of the implementation of environmental policies towards sustainable development as a chain of translation. These translations highlight unintended consequences of the policies, e.g. the creation of a temporary linguistic community allowing local and global 'time spaces' to merge.

TI Scientific consensus on sustainability: The case of the natural step
SO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB The Natural Step (TNS) is internationally promoted as the basis of a scientific consensus on sustainability. TNS appears potentially consensual because it argues from a position of summary trends that are scientifically informed. However, comparison with other sustainability principles shows that this appearance is unjustified. Firstly, this is because sustainability principles vary widely in their implications and purpose. Secondly, TNS is ambiguous in its approach to risk assessment and controversial in its implied proposal for zero growth in the physical parameters of the human economy, biodegradable material excepted. Two concepts from the sociology of science are used to account for international corporate and public uptake of TNS, despite its ambiguity and highly precautionary message. These are the boundary object and anchoring devices. TNS illustrates how operationalization of sustainability theories unavoidably involves value judgements relating to the choice of features to be sustained, despite any scientific content that those theories may have.

TI Ethical sourcing: A contribution to sustainability or a diversion?
SO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB There is a plethora of codes of practice emerging to help business manage and communicate social and environmental performance, particularly the relationship with suppliers in developing countries. These codes lie at the heart of ethical trading or ethical sourcing, and often tackle issues central to sustainable business. However, there are often separate codes addressing social and environmental criteria, and no real coherence in either their development or implementation. Consequently, the contribution of ethical sourcing to the sustainable business agenda is open to question.
   This paper, drawing on the work in developing countries of the Natural Resources and Ethical Trade programme as well as others in the field, examines the reasons behind the divergence in social and environmental codes of practice.(1) It explores the contribution ethical sourcing has made to increasing business responsibility, but argues that greater cohesion between social and environmental standards is necessary if this approach to value chain management is to help achieve sustainable business goals.

AB In this manuscript I take an interdisciplinary, systems approach to the regulation of risky operations that can harm ecological environments. I develop safety procedures aimed at minimizing the risks of operational failures and industrial accidents. The procedures are designed for practicing managers and regulatory agents to use in partnership across four interactive levels of analysis: individual (managers and regulatory agents), organizational (risky operations), industrial (groups of risky organizations) and societal (ecological environments).

AB This paper discusses five concepts that industrial managers or advocates can adopt that will contribute to sustaining the environment through focused and knowledgeable industrial management. These are (1) develop a sensitivity to the constantly changing environment; (2) work without complaining or blaming; (3) organize a system of environmental diligence; (4) implement a strategy of environmental protection and development; and (5) recognize and develop a relationship between trade and the environment. Successful development and implementation of these concepts will greatly enhance industry's commitment to and sustainability of the environment. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Make friends with the wild things
SO TRAINING & DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB In Maurice Sendak's Where the Wild Things Are, a boy named Max befriends creatures that once scared him. Sendak's story teaches that the wild things that frighten us can be actually become our allies, as well as sources of creativity and power.
   In the corporate world, the wild things are the ideas, opinions, or aspects of our nature that we view as dangerous or irrational-things to be kept under control. So we push those entities out, thus negating their value. But just because those elements have been suppressed doesn't mean that they disappear. Often they bubble to the surface, causing problems and undermining the best-laid plans.
   In process psychology, the ideas, opinions, and human traits that don't fit into cultural norms are defined as "secondary processes." Process psychology teaches that people can embrace such entities for renewal and sustainability of a group or an organization.
   Tapping into that power requires
   a lens that can help us view the larger picture
   attitudes that provide a nonthreatening welcome to the wild things
   tools to work with the wild things
   Another word for the attitudes we need to adopt in order to transform our relationship to wild things is metaskills. Weitzel and Had list and define 12 important facilitator metaskills, drawn from Action-Focused Facilitation Process Tools, by Patricia McLagan, Zoe Zimmerman, and Had.
   Effective facilitators not only adopt metaskills in their work, but also draw on process intervention tools that bring to a group's attention the ideas, feelings, or traits that have been pushed out. The article lists nine of these tools.
   Making friends with the wild things doesn't mean throwing out traditional organizational development approaches. The attitudes and tools Weitzel and Had suggest are best used in conjunction with traditional approaches, depending on what is most applicable at the time.

AB An account is given of the ecology of Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) as a pertinent example of how a virus can affect the sustainability of an important crop. It is now generally accepted that the technologies used in modern agriculture should ensure that production systems are operated in such a way that the quality of the produce is maintained year after year without causing degradation of the environment. Recent experiences in countries of the Mediterranean basin demonstrate that the benefits expected from the introduction of new and highly productive plant varieties may be quickly eroded by the concomitant introduction of new virus strains which can greatly change the structure of the resident virus population. Quarantine inspection of plant propagules and genetic engineering are suggested as powerful tools to help achieve sustainability. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The eutrophication of lakes causes serious problems, such as water-bloom consisting of the harmful blue-green algae. To prevent an unusual degree of growth of phytoplankton, various restoration methods have been tried. "Biomanipulation": which uses zooplankton to prey on the phytoplankton, is a promising method because it can, In principle, create a desirable ecosystem. However, there are many equivocal points in the long-term stability of a newly developed ecosystem after biomanipulations. The fate prediction of a water ecosystem using a lake mathematical model is thus essential for implementing biomanipulations. There remain, however, many uncertain points in the dynamic parameters of the lake models, especially the parameters concerned with zooplankton and fish. In this study, we established a lake mathematical model based on the carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus flows among the biotic and abiotic substances in a water ecosystem. In this model, two types of phytoplankton (non blue-green algae and blue-green algae), three types of zooplankton (rotatoria. cladocera and copepoda), planktivorous fish (crucian carp), detritus and dissolved matters were considered. The dynamic parameters were estimated with a set membership estimation algorithm using random scanning based on mesocosm experiments, which can provide more rigid data than actual lake observations can. The model calculations showed good agreement with the observation data for both the non-filamentous blue-green algae dominant case and the filamentous blue-green algae dominant case. Using this model, we calculated the long-term stability of the effects of biomanipulations in a hypothetical lake. The calculation results clarified the blue-green algal species specificity in the longterm effects of biomanipulations. In the non-filamentous blue-green algal dominant case, the Long-term stable suppression of algal growth was predicted under a certain threshold fish biomass, while in the filamentous blue-green algal dominant case, the suppression was not sustainable even in a no-fish-coexisting series. Model simulation is very important to the design of biomanipulations, and the model proposed in this study is suitable for this purpose. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Regional depressurization due to groundwater withdrawal from a large confined midcontinent aquifer may cause significant changes in the regional flow field and solute distributions through time. This study addresses the effects of depressurization in the Silurian-Devonian carbonate aquifer in the western flank of the Appalachian Basin in Ohio, where salinity-derived variable-density flow effects are significant. This complex hydrogeologic environment is examined using an interpretative, transient, numerical flow and transport model to examine the hydrodynamics involved in the salinization process, to simulate changes in the velocity field and solute distributions over the past 100-year period, and to forecast the effects of three different depressurizing scenarios over the next 100-year period. The results indicate that large-scale depressurization can lead to significant changes in the regional flow patterns, resulting in changes in solute distributions and salinization of a portion of the aquifer. Depressurization creates vertical flow gradients within the carbonate aquifer that transport brine from underlying and overlying shale units into the updip freshwater portion of the aquifer. Model results show the development of flow reversals in the downdip portions of the aquifer that facilitate transport of brine from the deeper portions of the carbonate aquifer. These processes result in significant water quality degradation in the updip portion of the aquifer, which is extensively used for municipal, industrial, and domestic water supplies. Our results indicate the need to monitor water levels, pumping rates, and water quality so that future management decisions regarding the sustainability of the resource are based on complete and accurate field data.

AB Although barriers to international trade were removed during the 1990s, log prices remain inefficiently low in Ecuador. Oligopsonistic conditions, which prevailed in the forestry sector under protectionism, have not been relieved by increased competition. The problem is that new investment is discouraged by weak property rights, corruption, and dated legislation that hinders forest dwellers' participation in the market economy. Unless and until institutional reform is undertaken to stimulate investment and competition, the prospects for Ecuador's tropical forests, which are among the most biodiverse in the world, will continue to be bleak.

AB With the increasing liberalisation of the dairy market the competition of price grows for the dairy farmer, The situation of the competition for a single farm is mainly influenced by the costs of dairy production. An empirical analysis based on the data of dairy farms in the northern part of Germany shows a large variation of costs of production. On the one hand the main factor of influence is the management of production, mostly reflected by the milk yield per cow, and on the other hand it is the stock size. From a certain level of farm size the influence of management prevails the effects of size. In the long run it is necessary to increase the productivity of labour- and capital through growth of size in order to ensure sustainability respectively improve the farms position in competition.

AB The term 'sustainable development' and its component 'sustainable land management(SLM)' have been receiving increasing attention in development co-operation and at the global level. However, practical tools which can help local users and multi-disciplinary teams to work together and apply these general concepts at the local to regional levels have emerged only very recently. Some of these tools, as well as programme support services are presented in this paper. The author argues that only a comprehensive, participatory approach involving stakeholders at all levels will have the potential to develop locally useful solutions within a favourable, i.e. 'enabling' institutional environment. Assessment tools will require transdisciplinary methods that involve natural, social, and political sciences as well as local knowledge systems. Support services for SLM activities will have to include monitoring and impact assessment, experimentation with innovative ideas, resource assessment, information, and training. Examples from different parts of the globe have shown that the proposed tools are now receiving greater attention and may fulfil the requirements set forth by the concept of SLM.

AB The required increase in agricultural production to meet future food demand will further increase pressure on land resources. Integrative indicators of the current status of the agricultural production capacity of land and their change over time are needed for promoting land management practices to maintain or improve land productivity and a sustainable use of natural resources. It is argued that such land quality indicators should be obtained with a holistic systems-oriented approach. Two land quality indicators are elaborated that deal with (1) yield gaps, i.e. the difference of actual yield and yield obtained under optimum management practices, or yields determined by the land-based natural resources, and (2) a soil nutrient balance, i.e. the rate with which soil fertility is changing. The yield gap is based on the calculation of land-based cereal productivity at three different levels in terms of potential, water limited, and nutrient limited production, considering weather, soil and crop characteristics. These modelled production levels do not incorporate socio-economic aspects, which may impede agricultural management in its effort to release stress because of inadequate soil fertility, water availability and/or occurrence of pests and diseases. Therefore, location specific actual yield levels are also considered. Besides an evaluation of the actual status of the land, it is important to consider the rate of change. The quantification of changes in soil nutrient stocks is crucial to identify problematic land use systems. The soil nutrient balance, i.e. the net difference between gross inputs and outputs of nutrients to the system, is used as measure for the changes. The indicator for the soil nutrient balance combines this rate of soil nutrient change and the soil nutrient stock. Indicators for yield gaps and soil nutrient balances are defined, procedures for their quantification are described and their general applicability is discussed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

   Southeast Asia; decision support system
AB The current pressure on land resources necessitates the development of sustainable land management (SLM) systems. The process of developing such systems requires that methods are available to assess sustainability easily. Indicators of SLM need to include indicators of soil quality and land quality, but in addition they must take account of the environmental setting and include the more human aspects of land management: the social, economic and political aspects.
   Three case studies were undertaken to assess the sustainability of different land management systems practised by farmers on sloping lands of Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam. Using the framework for evaluating sustainable land management (FESLM), detailed socio-economic and biophysical surveys were undertaken of 53 farms. The surveys aimed to characterise the land management systems, outline their constraints and potentials, and identify indicators and thresholds of sustainability in line with the five pillars of sustainability in the FESLM: productivity, security, protection, viability, and acceptability.
   The data were used to develop a suite of SLM indicators, with associated thresholds. These indicators have been included in a prototype decision support system (DSS). Feedback on the indicators was obtained from the farmers after the DSS was used to evaluate their farming systems. The indicators are highly specific as well as simplified, but they make a useful first step towards the development of a more generic system for evaluating SLM and for more accurate site specific and integrated evaluation. Evaluation of this structured and systematic approach yielded encouraging results in a separate study in Nepal. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V All rights reserved.

AB The impact(s) of development activities on land quality often become manifest only several years after termination of a project. Baseline studies and cost-effective monitoring needs to be initiated while activities are on-going, and this needs to be continued in post-project activities. This is possible, however, only when relatively simple and cost-efficient monitoring methods are available. These tools, however, are still rare and need to be further developed.
   An international working group, initiated by GTZ and SDC (Swiss Development Co-operation) and strongly supported by the 'Land Quality Indicator Initiative' of the World Bank, developed guidelines for impact monitoring to address this constraint. These included a toolkit of relatively easy to handle and cost-effective methods. The impact monitoring procedure presented involves seven basic steps: identification of stakeholders, identification of core issues, formulation of impact hypotheses, identification and selection of indicators, selection and development of monitoring methods, data analysis and assessment of sustainable land management, as well as information management.

AB The interaction between economic and ecologic dynamic systems is analyzed with a multi-player dynamic game, in which each player invests and allocates available capital to the production or consumption of natural resources and goods, and evaluates the outcome of all players' actions as well as the reactions of the ecosystem. During the course of repeated actions a dynamic process evolves such that the players adapt the amount of investment and the direction of its allocation according to their action preferences. For stability of the interaction matrix the players can form stable coalitions. Cooperation and negotiation on the amount and the allocation of investment could lead to more sustainable use of natural resources. The dynamic coalition-formation process corresponds to a self-organized transition from unilateral action (Nash equilibria) to multilateral cooperation (Pareto optima). With increasing number of players the complexity-stability tradeoff limits the stable coalition size. As an example for resource conflicts the exploitation of fish resources is simulated, for different fish populations and different players harvesting fish. (C) 2000 IMACS.

AB Schistosomiasis is being successfully controlled in many countries but remains a major public health problem, with an estimated 200 million people infected, mostly in Africa. Few countries in this region have undertaken successful and sustainable control programmes. The construction of water schemes to meet the power and agricultural requirements for development have lead to increasing transmission, especially of Schistosoma mansoni. Increasing population and movement have contributed to increased transmission and introduction of schistosomiasis to new areas. Most endemic countries are among the least developed whose health systems face difficulties to provide basic care at the primary health level. Constraints to control include, the lack of political commitment and infrastructure for public health interventions. Another constraint is that available anti-schistosomal drugs are expensive and the cost of individual treatment is a high proportion of the per capita drug budgets. There is need for increased support for schistosomiasis control in the most severely affected countries. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The biological control of schistosomiasis has already proven its efficiency in several habitats in the Caribbean area. Two main types of biological control agents, either trematode parasites or competitor snails have been studied and tested against the snail hosts of schistosomiasis in this region. The first one, Ribeiroia guadeloupensis, a trematode sterilizing Biomphalaria glabrata was successfully tested in a Guadeloupean pond housing a natural population of B. glabrata. The second agent involves several species of competitor snails belonging to the Ampullariidae (Pomacea glauca, Marisa cornuarietis) and Thiaridae (Tarebia granifera, Melanoides tuberculata) families. Ampullarid snails were tested with success in several West Indian islands such as Guadeloupe. Thiarid snails have also proven their efficiency but also their limits in several types of habitats in Guadeloupe, Martinique, St. Lucia and Venezuela. Competitor snails have also proven to be useful in preventing the recolonization by the snail hosts after molluscicide treatments. The case of the rivers of the littoral central part of Venezuela is particularly relevant to this issue. The island of Martinique also constitutes a good example of the importance of competitor snails in a post-transmission phase of schistosomiasis control. This island is a well-developed country where schistosomiasis transmission was interrupted in the 1970s. However, the reactivation of some transmission sites was observed in the 1980s. The introduction of M. tuberculata into these sites resulted in the interruption of transmission and the near total disappearance of the snail hosts. Presently, the thiarid snails have colonized the whole Martinican hydrographic system and maintain dense populations preventing an eventual recolonization by the planorbid snails and thus are maintaining a sustainable control.

TI Hearing impairment prevention in developing countries: making things

DT Article
DE hearing impairment; prevention; developing countries; primary healthcare
AB It is estimated that at least two thirds of the world's population of persons with disabling hearing impairment reside in developing countries. Yet, little and slow progress have been reported in these countries towards tackling this problem principally on account of inadequate resources. The prospects for improvement remain uncertain. This paper re-examines the peculiar nature of hearing impairment prevention within the context of the existing health-care needs of most of these nations. It establishes that the failure to recognize the dynamics of the social change that underlie an effective national programme on hearing impairment prevention may, in itself, forestall a successful and sustainable outcome even when more resources become available.

SO FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT

DT Article
DE rare tree species; assessment; adaptive sampling; biodiversity; Nepal
AB Sampling to assess rare tree species poses methodic problems, because they may cluster and many plots with no such trees are to be expected. We used systematic adaptive cluster sampling (SACS) to sample three rare tree species in a forest area of about 40 ha in Nepal. We checked its applicability and efficiency and compared it to conventional systematic sampling. Comparison of SAGS to conventional systematic sampling showed that efficiency for density estimation increased 500% for the clustered Schima wallichii, but reduced 40% for the unclustered Daphniphyllum himalayense. The method was found to be more efficient for larger groups of individuals of a rare species than for extremely small groups. SAGS may also be used to establish relationships with spatially referenced variables, but data availability was a constraint. SAGS is a promising design for resource managers and survey specialists dealing with rare and endangered species in the context of biodiversity and sustainable forest management.

AB Fluids at temperatures and pressures near their thermodynamic critical points are attracting attention as media for heterogeneous catalytic reactions. Several factors have motivated this interest in catalytic reactions in supercritical fluids (SCFs), but the paradigm of pollution prevention is one of the most important. The increased awareness of environmental sustainability and the trend toward pollution prevention has led to a consideration of environmentally benign solvents such as supercritical water for chemical processes. This article provides an overview of the types of heterogeneous catalytic reactions that have been accomplished in supercritical water. Additionally, we provide new experimental results for the heterogeneous catalytic oxidation of phenol in supercritical water over bulk TiO2 and compare the performance of different transition metal oxide catalysts for this reaction.

AB Developing a sustainable form of industry based on green technology will require radical technological innovation by the private sector: Stimulating innovation in green technology through public policy requires an understanding of technology the innovation process, and how policy affects the innovation behavior of firms. This article explores how to design public policy measures to stimulate green technology innovation. The potential of current environmental policy measures to stimulate green technology innovation is assessed. Opportunities are identified to improve our understanding of the innovation process, to use policy mechanisms to more effectively stimulate green technology development, and to direct the trajectories of key environmental technologies.

TI Industrial ecology - Paradigm shift or normal science?
SO AMERICAN BEHAVIORAL SCIENTIST
LA English
DT Article
AB Industrial ecology is an evolving framework for the analysis and design of public policy, corporate strategy and technological systems and products. Its metaphorical denotation springs from conceptual models characteristic of sustainable or long-lived ecosystems. Some authors stress the material and energy flows within a system of producers and consumers and aim to build knowledge about these flows that can be used for such design purposes as above. Others see industrial ecology primarily in its more metaphorical sense as providing new normative themes for a possibly sustainable world. Such norms include connectedness, cooperation, and community. These particular norms are, more or less, contrary to prevailing elements of social structures in market-based, industrialized nations. The paradigmatic, normative potential of industrial ecology is contrasted with its potential as an emerging "science" of sustainability.

TI Regulation, business, and sustainable development - The antecedents of
   environmentally conscious technological innovation
SO AMERICAN BEHAVIORAL SCIENTIST
LA English
DT Article
AB A growing number of firms have begun work toward the development of innovative systems that consume fewer resources. reduce waste, enhance productivity while creating new market opportunities. However all of this environmentally friendly innovation occurs under varying types/levels of regulation and the role of such regulation is still debatable. To date, little research exists that investigates the relative importance of market-driven versus regulatory actions in influencing environmental technological innovation. This article presents a model of the antecedents of environmentally conscious technological innovation under high and low amounts of regulation. The authors present four abbreviated case studies undertaken as part of a larger U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-funded study that describe environmentally conscious product and process innovations in high and low regulation environments. The authors use the case studies to examine the extent to which the data support our model. The article concludes with a discussion of the implications of our findings.

TI Recurrent remodeling after ventricular assistance: Is long-term
   myocardial recovery attainable?
SO ANNALS OF THORACIC SURGERY
LA English
DT Article

   CARDIOMYOPATHY
AB Background. Long-term left ventricular assist devices (LVAD) have been used both as a bridge to heart transplantation and to recovery of native myocardial function. Despite much evidence for reversal of some of the structural and functional changes present in the failing heart during LVAD support, clinical evidence for sustained myocardial recovery is scant. We describe 2 patients in whom myocardial recovery during LVAD support led to device explanation only to have heart failure recur. This necessitated a second LVAD implantation, a process that we have termed recurrent remodeling.
   Methods. The medical records of 2 patients with cardiomyopathy supported with HeartMate LVADs (Thermo Cardiosystems, Inc, Woburn, MA) were retrospectively reviewed.
   Results. One patient was supported with an LVAD for 2 months, at which time the LVAD was explanted. progressive deterioration of cardiac function followed, requiring a second LVAD 19 months after LVAD explanation. After 2 months of further LVAD support, a second episode of apparent myocardial recovery was observed during a period of device malfunction. The other patient was supported with an LVAD for 12 months, at which time the LVAD was explanted. The patient experienced progressive hemodynamic deterioration and required a second LVAD 6 months after LVAD explantation. Heart transplantations of both patients were successful.
   Conclusions. Our understanding of myocardial recovery in the setting of hemodynamic unloading with LVAD support has not yet progressed to the point where we are able to accurately predict successful long-term LVAD explantation. The evolution of reliable predictors of sustainable myocardial recovery will help to avoid further cases of recurrent remodeling requiring repeat LVAD implantation.

AB This paper examines the status of traditional agriculture in two areas of Azilal province in the Atlas Mountains, seeking to identify what is needed to counter any breakdown in livelihood strategies and improve the quality of life enjoyed by the farmers. Irrigated terrace agriculture is an important part of livelihood strategies in the areas studied and has the potential to be more productive and sustainable. In some areas it is reported to be endangered by socioeconomic changes and highland land degradation caused by excessive shifting cultivation, sheep and goat grazing, and charcoal production. Field visits made during summer 1998 to establish the condition of irrigated terrace and runoff agriculture and the factors affecting it showed that in at least: one of the villages supportive social capital has ensured that challenges are being met and beneficial innovations are being made. Considerable variation in success was evident from community to community, with some farmers maintaining adequate lifestyles and innovating, while in other communities prospects are less promising. The effects of structural adjustment have clearly been felt and may also have triggered some of the highland degradation and difficulties, which clearly threaten some irrigated terrace agriculture and other livelihood practices.

AB The plant kingdom is colonized by a diverse array of endophytic bacteria which form non-pathogenic relationships with their hosts. When beneficial, such associations can stimulate plant growth, increase disease resistance, improve the plant's ability to withstand environmental stresses (e.g. drought), or enhance N(2) fixation. Crop sequences can favour the build-up of advantageous associations of bacterial endophyte populations leading to the development and maintenance of beneficial host-endophyte allelopathies. Utilization of rhizobacteria in sustainable crop production systems will require strategies to create and maintain beneficial bacterial populations within crops (endophytes) and as well in the soils surrounding those crops.

ID NIGERIA
AB An association in an alley cropping experiment of a short-term maize variety and a tree legume (Gliricidia sepium) adapted to the Sudanese Sahel region was studied from the point of view of the nitrogen balance and plot yields. Isotopic labelling applied in the field enabled the contribution to maize nitrogen nutrition from different nitrogen sources ( fertilizer, prunings, and soil) to be quantified. For equal cultivated areas, alley cropping provides a maize yield greater than that of maize grown in pure stand without nitrogen fertilizer. However this yield is only 40% of that obtained in pure stands with fertilizer nitrogen. Alley cropping gives a very favourable Land Equivalent Ratio (LER) of 0.90 and 1.58 compared with N-fertilized and non-N-fertilized plots, respectively. These LERs demonstrate the increased biological efficiency of the cultivated soil in an agroforestry system. The percentage of the total nitrogen in the maize coming from prunings (Nfdp) varies between 30 and 35% and the true coefficient of nitrogen utilization of the prunings (TCUp) varies from 15-25%. In the environment of central Senegal, the percentage of total nitrogen of G. sepium coming from N-2 fixation is quite low (Ndffix = 25%), and consequently, in the maize, the nitrogen coming from N-2 fixation (Ndffix) is only 8%. It is therefore necessary to improve the efficiency of nitrogen fixation of G. sepium in this zone to assure the sustainability of the agroforestry system.

AB Objective: The objective of this study is to explore the significance of the experience of liveliness in psychotherapeutic interactions and its relevance to the practice of psychotherapy.
   Method: Stern's notion of 'vitality affects' and Emde's concept of a 'primary affective core' are employed in developing a concept of liveliness, or an enlivening-deadening axis of experience. A critique of Freud's 'principles of mental functioning' is made in the light of this concept. Clinical examples are provided as illustrations of the relevance of considering the 'sense of liveliness', and its sustainability, in psychotherapy.
   Results and Conclusions: A sense of liveliness relates closely to activity within a system of interpersonal resonance with non-linear characteristics. The experience of, and responses to, vitality affects may be an important basis of a sense of liveliness. Sudden shifts towards experiences of deadness are a matter for concern in psychotherapy. This sphere of experience, although occurring largely outside verbal awareness, may constitute a distinct type of mental process. Three types of mental activity or process are postulated: (i) emergent, pre-representational activity characterised by the sense of liveliness; (ii) Play-related thought or activity typically experienced as enlivening; and (iii) work-related or adaptational thought or activity.

TI Precautionary priority in approving imports of genetically improved

SO BIOTECHNOLOGY LAW REPORT
LA English
DT Article
ID SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE
AB The "precautionary approach" to genetically improved organisms set forth in the newly issued biosafety protocol can be interpreted as: (1) limiting the use of certain genetically modified crops in agriculture pending further study of potentially disastrous ecological impacts, and (2) encouraging the use of certain genetically modified crops in certain contexts where the crops decrease the pace at which humanity is destroying biological diversity. To achieve the ambitious objectives of the Convention on Biological Diversity, the Biosafety Protocol should be interpreted as giving priority to adoption of innovative agricultural technologies that promote the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity. As a result, the protocol should compel the rapid approval with postmarket surveillance of the low-risk genetically improved row crops that are exported in commodities shipments (in particular, corn and soybeans) that provide nations struggling with food security(2) with the tools needed to meet goals for conserving biological diversity and assuring food security. Careful planning for ensuring food security and the efficient distribution of commodities will reduce the pressure that global hunger can place on conservation efforts.
   The single greatest threat to biodiversity in the 21(st) Century is likely to be the pressure to meet the needs of the billions of new human beings arriving on this planet, all of whom will need to be fed as efficiently as possible. Genetically improved crops flowing through the bulk commodities system can increase the quantity and ecological sustainability of global food production. To slow the intertwined downward spiral of hunger and biodiversity loss, the world will require efficiency of food distribution and increasing the productivity of the land currently cleared for use. The role of the bulk commodities shipments and the recombinant DNA process in promoting management of biodiversity should be documented to assist parties to the Convention in meeting its objectives.
   Commodities imports that "may contain" genetically improved crops should be permitted to continue to be freely traded without special documentation recording the details of GMO content. This nondiscriminatory treatment of the rDNA process should be compelled under the precautionary approach to the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity.

AB Both lifestyle and geography make the delivery of consumer health information in the rural setting unique. The Planetree Health Resource Center in The Dalles, Oregon, has served the public in a rural setting for the past eight years. It is a community-based consumer health library, affiliated with a small rural hospital, Mid-Columbia Medical Center. One task of providing consumer health information in rural environments is to be in relationship with individuals in the community. Integration into community life is very important for credibility and sustainability. The resource center takes a proactive approach and employs several different outreach efforts to deepen its relationship with community members. It also works hard to foster partnerships for improved health information delivery with other community organizations, including area schools. This paper describes Planetree Health Resource Center's approach to rural outreach.

   cropping practice
AB Brassica napus L, canola production on the Canadian prairies often is limited by hot, dry growing conditions in early July and a short growing season. Brassica napus canola seeded in the fall just prior to freeze-up or in the early spring as soon as fields are passable may allow canola to avoid these adverse conditions. Our objective was to determine if late October (fall), or mid- to late April (April) seeding dates improve canola yield and quality relative to a mid-May (15 to 20 May) seeding date. Plant density and height, phenological development, seed yield, seed weight and seed oil content were assessed in plots sown to herbicide-tolerant B. napus canola at three seeding dates on five fellow sites and three stubble sites at Scott, SK, from 1994 to 1998. A thinner plant stand occurred for the fall compared with spring seeding dates; however, this difference rarely. corresponded with less canola yield. Fifty percent flowering occurred 20 d earlier (June rather than July), reproductive growth (50% flowering to maturity) was 10 d longer, plants were 23 (fall) or 8 (April) cm shorter, and maturity occurred 13 d earlier when canola was seeded in the fall and April compared with mid-May seeding. Canola seed yield was 38% greater when seeded on the alternative dates rather than the more traditional mid-May seeding date. The yield advantage for alternative seeding dates was greater and more consistent on stubble than on fallow likely because of lack of soil crusting and temperature and wind protection from stubble. The response of seed weight to seeding date was similar to that for seed yield, indicating that a portion of the positive yield response to alternative seeding dates was associated with larger seed size. Oil content also was greater for the fall and April compared with mid-May seeding dates, but the improvement was smaller (6%) than that for seed yield. Fall- and April-seeded canola tolerated spring frosts and avoided adversely hot, dry weather during the flowering period, thus improving canola seed yield and quality. Alternative seeding dates provide canola producers in semi-arid regions with a sustainable option to diversify their cropping systems.

ID DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; HOUSING FINANCE; INDIA
AB In terms of wide-scale human welfare and sustainability, the conditions of life in urban squatter settlements have enormous significance. They comprise some 30-70% of the housing stock in many cities and towns in developing countries. Their scale is attributed to the inadequacies of housing finance systems and land development, along with the pressing realities of demographic growth and mass poverty, A major aim of international aid agencies and sometimes of governments is to improve the sanitary services and the legitimacy of property and occupancy rights in some squatter settlements. This aim has basic importance in development transitions, and especially in those associated with health, poverty, and brown agenda, urban environments, This raises dilemmas in institutional and organisational approaches to the improvement of squatter settlements, and it changes relationships between residents and their associations to urban politics and economics. More than this, households and communities will sometimes change their attitudes and approaches towards their housing and the environment, The discussions in this article explore these themes, some adding new dimensions to the literature.

AB A widely used assumption in forestry is that the demand for timber will exceed the maximum level available from forests on a sustainable basis. In this study, measurements of extracted timber and modeled forest productivity were used to investigate the relationship between harvested timber and natural forest productivity for current conditions, and under global change scenario. The analysis was confined to coniferous forests and countries that have coniferous forests within their territories. Annual roundwood production from the database of Food and Agriculture Organization was used as an approximation of annual timber harvest for each country. Annual stem primary productivity of coniferous forests was estimated using the BIOME-BGC model. Based on the current rates, annual timber extraction was extrapolated for each country for the next 80 years. Then, on a country basis, the timber harvest was related to the modeled forest stem productivity, assuming that the area of coniferous forest would stay unchanged for the next 80 years. The results of this study suggest that global coniferous forests currently produce more wood than people consume, but that this gap will narrow in the future.
   The results also suggest that wood extraction may reach forest regrowth by the middle of the next century, even though most coniferous forests are located in high latitudes and may have an accelerated stem growth associated with the joint effect of climate change and elevated carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere.

AB The ways in which people use beaches have important implications for coastal zone management, and in order for beach use to be sustainable, it often needs to be managed. The degree and mode of management depends on the circumstances of the beach, region, and country in question. The present legislation and coastal zone management framework in Ireland has shortcomings when in comes to managing beach use. One way of working within the present system to improve coastal management is through the use of bylaws managing beach use. They provide an opportunity for an integrated management approach that can focus on beach use, reflect the needs of the local community, and avoid the problems caused by the land-sea divide and the division of responsibility in the coastal zone.

AB This study presents evidence from the Cuyutlan lagoon, which demonstrates that aquaculture can be socially acceptable, economically viable and environmentally friendly when consideration is first taken of the local circumstances and environment. This evidence was obtained through a user survey, which asked key questions of the local fishing community. These questions aimed to determine the desires and needs of the local community in the context of the local environment. The results from this survey of 56% of the fishing community were presented. The wishes of the fishing community are discussed and a compromise suggested for a sustainable aquaculture for the Cuyutlan lagoon.

SO COMBUSTION AND FLAME

AB Nonlinear dynamics of radiation-induced oscillatory instability in diffusion flames is numerically investigated by employing a diffusion flame established in stagnant mixing layer with optically thin gas-phase radiation and unity Lewis numbers for all species as a model. Particular attention is focused on the radiation-induced extinction regime that occurs when the Damkohler number is sufficiently large. Transient evolution of the flame, initiated by imposing a Damkohler number perturbation on the steady solution, exhibits three types of flame-evolution behaviors, namely decaying oscillatory solution, diverging solution to extinction, and stable limit-cycle solution. The locus of the critically perturbed Damkohler number, across which diverging solutions are separated from decaying solutions or limit-cycle solutions, is obtained, and it can be used as a dynamic extinction boundary for laminar flamelet library. The bifurcation structure is found to be a double Hopf bifurcation, involving a supercritical Hopf bifurcation and a subcritical Hopf bifurcation. The stable limit-cycle solutions, which occur only in the radiation-induced extinction regime while not observed in the transport-induced extinction regime, are found in a small island-shaped parametric region of Damkohler number and flame temperature, in which the double Hopf bifurcation exists, with perturbation amplitudes smaller than the amplitude of the unstable limit cycle of the subcritical Hopf bifurcation. The stable limit-cycle behavior is implied to be relevant to the remarkably sustainable droplet-flame oscillations observed in the space shuttle experiment. (C) 2000 by The Combustion Institute.

AB In 1998, tropical sea surface temperatures were the highest on record, topping off a 50-year trend for some tropical oceans. In the same year, coral reefs around the world suffered the most extensive and severe bleaching (loss of symbiotic algae) and subsequent mortality on record. These events may not be attributable to local stressors or natural variability alone but were likely induced by nit underlying global phenomenon. It is probable that anthropogenic global warming has contributed to the extensive coral blenching that has occurred simultaneously throughout the reef regions of the world The geographic extent, increasing frequency, and regional severity of mass bleaching events are an apparent result of a steadily rising baseline of marine temperatures, combined with regionally specific El Nino and La Nina events. The repercussions of the 1998 mass bleaching and mortality events will be far-reaching. Human populations dependent on reef services face losses of marine biodiversity, fisheries, and shoreline protection. Coral bleaching events may become more frequent and severe as the climate continues to warm, exposing coral reefs to an increasingly hostile environment. This global threat to corals compounds the Effects of more localized anthropogenic factors that already place reefs at risk. Significant attention needs to be given to the monitoring of coral reef ecosystems, research on the projected and realized effects of global climate change, and measures to curtail greenhouse gas emissions. Even those reefs with well-enforced legal protection as marine sanctuaries, or those managed for sustainable use, are threatened by global climate change.

AB Treatment of chronic hepatitis B is directed at interrupting the natural history and clinical outcomes of the disease. It needs to take into account the virology and replication cycle of the hepatitis B virus (HBV), and the host immune response to HBV. Long term follow-up of patients treated with interferon supports the paradigm that a sustained, major suppression of HBV replication, particularly that associated with hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) seroconversion, interrupts the natural history of hepatitis B. The availability of potent but well tolerated and orally available HBV antivirals, of which lamivudine is the prototype, has allowed clearer treatment objectives to be formulated. These are: temporary or permanent reduction of hepatitis (necroinflammatory) activity, arrest of fibrotic progression, prevention of cirrhosis and liver failure, and prevention of recurrent HBV infection after liver transplantation. Lamivudine has good medium term efficacy in achieving each of these objectives. The only significant problem for the longer term is emergence of antiviral resistance conferred by mutations in the YMDD (tyro sine-methionine-aspartic acid-aspartic acid) motif of the HEV reverse transcriptase. As a result, contentious issues remain about defining when antiviral therapy is indicated, whether to treat for a defined interval or indefinitely and when to stop treatment if HBeAg seroconversion is not achieved. Some personal views are expressed in this review.
   Among newer HBV antivirals in clinical studies, adefovir dipivoxil, entecavir and emtricitabine appear to be at least as potent as lamivudine in suppressing HBV replication. Famciclovir appears less potent. In vitro studies show that YMDD mutations confer cross-resistance between lamivudine, emtricitabine and beta -L-Fd4C (L-2',3'-didehydro-dideoxy-5-fluorocytidine) However, adefovir dipivoxil, lobucavir, entecavir, DAPD (beta -D-2,6-diaminopurine dioxolane) and possibly clevudine (L-FMAU) suppress replication of YMDD mutant HBV, as well as wildtype. Preliminary studies indicate clinical efficacy of adefovir dipivoxil once resistance to lamivudine has developed. Immunomodulatory approaches to treatment of chronic hepatitis B are conceptually attractive, but newer agents used to date (thymalfasin, interleukin-12, therapeutic vaccines) have not demonstrated sufficient efficacy for widespread use. The next challenge for HBV treatment is to use antivirals in combination and/or in cyclical therapy to reduce the emergence of drug resistance and increase efficacy, particularly to achieve sustainable posttreatment suppression of hepatitis B.

AB This paper reviews international law and policy regarding the rights of indigenous peoples and local communities that are defining the role of traditional and indigenous knowledge in the management and conservation of biodiversity. The most influential forums occur within the United Nations system, particularly the Working Group on Indigenous Populations and the Convention on Biological Diversity. We discuss the "soft-law" context of declarations, regional agreements, ethical guidelines, research protocols, and policy frameworks, which reinforce indigenous entitlements. The elaboration of these rights will increasingly impinge upon scientific research by regulating access to the knowledge and resources of indigenous and local communities, and by requiring that policy and management be made with their full participation. Scientists should respond by following these developments, institutionalizing this participation at all levels of scientific activity, and respecting the value of indigenous knowledge.

AB This paper discusses the characteristics and application of Traditional Ecological Knowledge and Wisdom (TEKW) of aboriginal peoples in British Columbia, Canada. Examples are provided from various groups, most notably, the Secwepemc (Shuswap) Interior Salish and Kwakwaka'wakw and Nuu-Chah-Nulth peoples of the Northwest Coast, covering a range of features comprising TEKW: knowledge of ecological principles, such as succession and interrelatedness of all components of the environment; use of ecological indicators; adaptive strategies for monitoring, enhancing, and sustainably harvesting resources; effective systems of knowledge acquisition and transfer; respectful and interactive attitudes and philosophies; close identification with ancestral lands; and beliefs that recognize the power and spirituality of nature. These characteristics, taken in totality, have enabled many groups of aboriginal peoples to live sustainably within their local environments for many thousands of years. In order for TEKW to be incorporated appropriately into current ecosystem-based management strategies, the complete context of TEKW, including its philosophical bases, must be recognized and respected. A case study of ecological and cultural knowledge of the traditional root vegetables yellow avalanche lily (Erythronium grandiflorum) and balsamroot (Balsamorhiza sagittata) illustrates ways in which these components can be integrated.

AB The program of People's Biodiversity Registers (PBR) is an attempt to promote folk ecological knowledge and wisdom in two ways: by devising more formal means for their maintenance, and by creating new contexts for their continued practice. PBRs document folk ecological knowledge and practices involving the use of natural resources, with the help of local educational institutions and NGOs working in collaboration with local, decentralized institutions of governance. During 1996-1998, 52 such documents were prepared from village clusters distributed in eight states and union territories representing a wide spectrum of ecological and social regimes of India. They reveal a picture of generally declining productivity and diversity of living resources outside of intensively managed ecosystems. There are, however, notable exceptions; two of our case studies provide examples of self-organized systems of management that have successfully protected, and indeed promoted, restoration of forest and wildlife resources. The PBRs also indicate a widespread erosion of practical ecological knowledge and of traditions of sustainable use and conservation. This is linked to the fact that those most intimately dependent on and knowledgeable about biodiversity belong to the economically and politically most disadvantaged segments of the society. In consequence, conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity are not a high priority among the development aspirations held by the people. Nevertheless, people are concerned about degradation of the base of living resources and offer a number of concrete suggestions on their management. In fact, in a few cases, the PER exercises have encouraged people to put such measures for more prudent use of local biodiversity resources into practice. The process of preparation of PBRs, as well as the resultant documents, could serve a significant role in promoting more sustainable, flexible, participatory systems of management and in ensuring a better flow of benefits from economic use of the living resources to the local communities.

AB Indigenous people view both themselves and nature as part of an extended ecological family that shares ancestry and origins. It is an awareness that life in any environment is viable only when humans view the life surrounding them as kin. The kin, or relatives, include all the natural elements of an ecosystem. Indigenous people are affected by and, in turn, affect the life around them. The interactions that result from this "kincentric ecology" enhance and preserve the ecosystem. Interactions are the commerce of ecosystem functioning. Without human recognition of their role in the complexities of life in a place, the life suffers and loses its sustainability. Indigenous cultural models of nature include humans as one aspect of the complexity of life. A Raramuri example of iwigara will serve to enhance understanding of the human-nature relationship that is necessary in order to fully comprehend the distinct intricacies of kincentric ecology.

AB Wetlands ail over the world have been lost or are threatened in spite of various international agreements and national policies. This is caused by: (1) the public nature of many wetlands products and services; (2) user externalities imposed on other stakeholders; and (3) policy intervention failures that are due to a lack of consistency among government policies in different areas (economics, environment, nature protection, physical planning, etc.). All three causes are related to information failures which in turn can be linked to the complexity and 'invisibility' of spatial relationships among groundwater, surface water and wetland vegetation. Integrated wetland research combining social and natural sciences can help in part to solve the information failure to achieve the required consistency across various government policies. An integrated wetland research framework suggests that a combination of economic valuation, integrated modelling, stakeholder analysis, and multi-criteria evaluation can provide complementary insights into sustainable and welfare-optimising wetland management and policy. Subsequently, each of the various components of such integrated wetland research is reviewed and related to wetland management policy. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

ID COMMON PROPERTY; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; MANAGEMENT; PEOPLE; SYSTEMS
AB This paper argues that successful conservation of wetlands is fundamentally determined by the institutions and property rights associated with resource management decisions. Thus an understanding of property rights regimes, the constraints which they impose on users of wetlands resources, and the distribution of benefits of use among users and non-users are essential if the economic values of wetland ecosystems and functions are to be realised. We outline relevant theoretical perspectives on property rights and the sustainable utilisation of natural resources. We argue that wetland resources tend to have unique property rights regimes due to their ecological characteristics, namely, their multiple-resource characteristics, the indivisible nature of these resources, and the seasonal and cyclical nature of different wetland resource components. Case studies of property rights regimes in Indonesia and Vietnam are presented. These show that wetland resources are often managed as common pool resources, and that state appropriation of resources or the imposition of private property rights can contribute to unsustainable utilisation or conversion of wetlands to other uses.

AB 'Hydrology and Water Resources Development in a Vulnerable Environment' is the topic of the current phase of IHP-V. To ascertain sustainable use of landscape resources, ecohydrological processes in the surficial environment must be studied. The objectives of Project 2.3 are the interactions between river systems, floodplains, and wetlands. The gap between hydrology and ecology must be closed to understand the hydrological cycle in different ecosystems and to gain more detailed information on the plant and animal communities that influence the flow of water and its contents. Project 2.4 aims at the comprehensive assessment of the surficial ecohydrological processes on a global scale. Through experimental research, flow of water, sediments, nutrients, and pollutants in different scales, climates and geographic regions must be studied. Non-structural measures for construction and management should be evaluated with respect to environmental quality enhancement, and water ecosystem vulnerability should be assessed. It is the incitement to collect hydrological and ecological data in a more balanced way. Efficient lines of research in ecohydrology start with getting to know the partner's concepts and to begin to think in the partner's scales. This will indicate the start of genuine integrated research with all partners joined in an interdisciplinary network. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The development of a method of sustainable land use balanced with an ecosystem stability parallel to intensive cultivation was the aim of a restoration project in northwest Germany. The results of a substantial experiment in landscape ecology, conducted on a 1000-ha area in the past decade, demonstrate that small-sized, unused patches and linear structures connecting them are important parts of a protective concept for nature conservation. Thus, a restoration of semi-natural water courses with temporarily inundated floodplains, and other linear landscape structures, such as dam hedges, have a variety of functions, not only as paths of migration, habitats and protection against substance transports, but also as sites of active elimination of a nutrient surplus and other substances. Buried ecological potential, in the form of seeds of past communities, regenerates as soon as barriers to adequate survival have been removed. Restoration, creating and connecting a variety of smaller ecosystems within a landscape not only will be an important contribution to stabilizing floristic and faunistic assemblages and to the elimination of a nutrient surplus, but will result in significant improvements to ecosystem functioning of nearby intensively cultivated landscapes. However, an unalterable precondition for sustainable land-use must be the adjustment of cultivation to the carrying capacity of the land. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Lake Sevan is the largest freshwater body in Armenia and influences the water regime of the neighbouring countries, Iran and Turkey. Hydrobiological modelling techniques were applied to data collected from Lake Sevan since the 1970s and this has provided insight into the functioning of the ecosystem of the lake. Overexploitation and pollution initiated widespread changes throughout the entire lake basin. Uncontrolled abstraction of the lake's water caused severe water level reduction, resulting in eutrophication and water quality degradation. These events have major implications for Armenia. Any future hydrological engineering development should be preceded by an appropriate ecological impact assessment to prevent catastrophes similar to those experienced at Lake Sevan. There is a need to investigate the socio-economic consequences of the changes to Lake Seven and develop measures to limit potentially damaging economic activities. Additionally, this study has identified the need to develop tools to predict the effects of changes that threaten sustainable lake development. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The authors investigate the ways in which sustainable development is interpreted within the development plan process, focusing on the roles of local politicians and planners. The rapidly developing 'policy space' surrounding the idea of sustainable development provides opportunities for engagement between planners, politicians, and other local actors. This policy space and its relationship to the plan-making process is outlined, along with key political aspects, before the results from an investigation into two case-study unitary development plans are presented. These illustrate how the influences of planners and politicians, along with key characteristics of the planning system, were instrumental in shaping both the content and the form of sustainable development policies and had implications for the way in which local sustainable development was interpreted.

AB The current government has significantly reduced the scale of the road-building programme. Instead of new roads, where practical it wishes to see alternative, more sustainable, transport strategies pursued in attempts to reduce problems of traffic congestion. These strategies are to be evaluated within a new form of transport-assessment framework known as a multimodal study (MMS). A pioneering version of an MMS, the Sustainable Transport Study for Aberdeen (STSA), was published in 1998. Significantly, it was prepared against the backcloth of a proposal for a major strategic new road, the Western Peripheral Route. The authors consider whether the STSA provides a rigorous and objective examination of the full range of practical transport strategies for the city of Aberdeen in northeast Scotland, and consider how far it conforms in its scope and methodology to that advised in (subsequently published) government guidance on MMSs.

AB This paper describes the pioneering experience of the city of Leicester (in the UK) over the last 10 years in developing its Local Agenda 21, and other aspects of its work towards environmental improvement and sustainable development. It includes details of measures to improve public transport and to reduce congestion, traffic accidents, car use and air pollution. If also describes measures to improve housing quality for low-income households, to reduce fossil fuel use and increase renewable energy use and to make the city council's own operations a model for reducing resource use and waste. If also describes how this was done - the specialist working groups that sought to make partnerships work (and their strengths and limitations), the information programmes to win hearts and minds, the many measures to encourage widespread participation (and the difficulties in involving under-represented groups) and the measures to make local governments, businesses and other groups develop the ability and habit of responding to the local needs identified in participatory consultations.

TI The politics of sustainable cities: the case of Bengare, Mangalore in
   coastal India
SO ENVIRONMENT AND URBANIZATION
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper describes a local-national conflict over a power generation scheme in Mangalore (India) in order to highlight two important issues. The first is that the planning of large projects by national and state governments in India often bypasses local government and, as such, avoids accountability to local populations. The second is that the politics of sustainable cities is in the institutional domain; in this instance, the conflict was between what teas perceived focally as being sustainable as opposed to external interests that sought to exploit resources in response to larger markets. The paper describes the political organizations in a fishing settlement (Bengare) that falls within the boundaries of the city of Mangalore and how they worked with elected city corporation representatives to halt a scheme for barge-mounted power generation. It also describes how the city government of Mangalore has become more committed to participation.

AB The relationship between azalea lace bug, Stephanitis pyrioides (Scott), abundance and components of vegetational texture were examined in managed landscapes to determine which component(s) best explained patterns in lace abundance. In managed landscapes, azalea lace bug is a key pest of azaleas and its abundance varies dramatically in time and space. The components of vegetational texture examined were light exposure, plant species diversity, evenness and richness, host patch size, and structural complexity of the landscape. The best habitat predictors of lace bug abundance were structural complexity and light exposure explaining 54 and 53% of lace bug variation, respectively. Three of the remaining four components also were significantly related to lace bug abundance. Further examination of light exposure revealed that afternoon readings explained more of the variation (52%) in lace bug abundance than morning readings (9%). Of the five vegetational strata that comprise structural complexity, the overstory tree layer and ground cover/turf layer (70%) were the best predictors of lace bug abundance. The implications of this work are that landscapes can be evaluated for susceptibility to lace bugs and perhaps other pests. It also provides information for designing landscapes that support fewer pest problems, resulting in low-input sustainable landscapes.

AB A complex method for assessing the ecological state of groundwater by using indicators and indexes of underground hydrosphere sustainable development, and of characterizing its quality, is given for an oil field. The concept of forming indicators and indexes of sustainable development has been elaborated for this purpose. When forming a structure of environment indicators, the developments of the European Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in this sphere were considered. New indicators are given and a structure of indexes quantitatively characterizing them is worked out. Indexes can be simple, complex, multidisciplinary and inter-multidisciplinary by their structure. By their essence indexes are subdivided into five classes: indexes of quality, damage, interaction, hydrogeochemical and dynamic ones. The ecological state of groundwater is assessed by the following categories of sustainability: sustainable, slightly unsustainable, medium unsustainable, unsustainable, highly unsustainable, catastrophically unsustainable.

AB The thermochemical conversion and recycling of hazardous solid waste materials is investigated using high-temperature solar process heat. Two important sources of wastes contaminated with heavy metal oxides are considered: (1) electric are furnace dust (EAFD) and (2) automobile shredder residue (ASR). The chemical equilibrium composition of these complex materials and the energy required to process them, using carbon, methane, or pyre-coke as reducing agents, are computed for temperatures in the range 300-2000 K. Metals can be extracted from their oxides in reducing atmospheres at above 1300 K for both EAFD and ASR: Zn is obtained in the gas phase, while Fe, Pb, and Cu are obtained in the condensed phase. The thermal energy requirements for converting EAFD at 1500 K are 3008 kJ/ kg and 4143 kJ/kg using C(gr) and CH4 as reducing agents, respectively. For converting ASR at 1500 K, 2455 kJ/kg are required. The solar exergy conversion efficiency, i.e., the efficiency of converting solar energy into the chemical energy of the reaction products (given by the Gibbs free energy change of product oxidation), can be as high as 69% for the EAFD conversion and 87% for the ASR conversion. Major sources of irreversibilities are those associated with the reradiation losses of the solar reactor and the heat rejected during the quenching. The use of concentrated solar energy as the source of process heat avoids emissions of greenhouse gases and other pollutants derived from the combustion of fossil fuels and further offers the possibility of converting waste materials into valuable commodities for processes in closed and sustainable materials cycles.

TI Health seeking and hygiene behaviours predict nutritional status of
   pre-school children in a slum area of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia
SO ETHIOPIAN MEDICAL JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
ID DETERMINANTS; INFECTION; GROWTH
AB A cross-sectional study was done from March to May 1997 in four selected slum kebeles (villages) of Addis Ababa in which nutritional status of 758 children aged 6 to 36 months was examined and stratified into malnourished and well nourished groups. Analysis of hygiene and health seeking practices of randomly selected households of the two sets of children determined practices that significantly exacerbate childhood malnutrition. The rates of immunization for the malnourished (80.2%) and well nourished households (77.6%) were practically the same. No significant difference was found in the prevalence of home treatment or food withholding habits at times of diarrhoea episodes between the two, groups. The study established six: variables to predict childhood malnutrition in the slum Section of Addis Ababa: I) presence of child waste inside house (Odds Ratio = 7.44; p < 0.0001, 2) diarrhoea treatment at the hospital (OR = 0.47;p < 0.05), 3) prolonged storage of cooked foods (OR = 2.86 ;p < 0.05), 4) feeding with washed hands (OR = 0.44; p < 0.01), and 5)poor handling of drinking wafer (OR = 3.18; p < 0.01) and 6) foods'(OR = 3.52; p < 0.01). Hence strong and: sustainable advice with a view of changing the behaviours of households towards good personal and household hygiene practices, and increased utilization of health settings is recommended as these may limit the overall success of public health programmes.

TI The liberalization of the land market in Spain: The 1998 reform of urban
   planning legislation
SO EUROPEAN PLANNING STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
AB Against a general climate of liberalization, the Spanish Government has made a concerted effort to bring about a reduction in house prices. A legislative reform in April 1998 has sought to liberalize land and planning, through (a) refining the category of land previously excluded from development to enable residential development to take place, (b) allowing for greater flexibility of land uses and building controls, and (c) reducing administrative controls. This paper discusses the extent to which such reforms are likely to meet their anticipated objectives, resulting in beneficial effects in the land and housing markets, as well as the territorial impact of such reforms from a sustainability perspective.

TI Neo-liberalism and its impact on overfishing and overcapitalisation in
   the marine fisheries of Chile, Mexico and Peru
SO FOOD POLICY
LA English
DT Article
ID LATIN-AMERICA; TAX-REFORM; SUSTAINABILITY; POLITICS; EXPORTS
AB The linkages between neo-liberalism and the fisheries sector in three of Latin America's principal fishing nations are examined. The paper shows how macroeconomic policies have not only re-inforced the sector's traditional export orientation but also permitted increased private participation in harvesting and processing. Production and export growth was facilitated by the absence of an effective regulatory framework as the belief that fish stocks were plenteous (following the designation of 200 mile Economic Exclusion Zones in the 1970s) encouraged governments to permit open access fisheries regimes. The belated recognition that there were indeed 'limits to growth' spawned a series of fisheries laws in the early-1990s which have sought to re-regulate the sector. To date these efforts have been largely unsuccessful and the principal regional fisheries are presently both overcapitalised and dangerously overfished, (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB The population changes of two larch casebearer (Coleophora laricella Hbn.) populations were analysed under field conditions from 1991 to 1995 using a differential analysis: one insect species feeding at the same time on two needle types (spurshoot and longshoot needles) of two host species (European and Japanese Larch) under two different environments (Solling hills: resource-rich stand, lowlands: resource-poor stand). Casebearer density in the lowlands was always significantly lower than in the Selling hills. The main factors regulating casebearer density were obviously the same for both populations, although feeding intensity and environmental conditions differed. The most important factors influencing density changes were the mortality of the mining young larvae and, to a lesser degree, the hibernation and spring mortality of the L3/L4 larvae. The rates of pupal parasitism were low in the Selling hills (max. 8.7%) although density was much higher than in the lowlands where pupal parasitism was higher (max. 18.5%). There was no evidence for regulative effects of parasites or predators in both populations. It is supposed that larval mortality mainly depends on needle physiology, which in turn is supposed to be influenced by environmental conditions. Different environmental conditions seemed to determine the feeding tolerance levels of the infested host trees. Therefore, Larch trees growing under optimal conditions may be able to tolerate periodical defoliation by the casebearer but Larch trees growing under suboptimal conditions may have to reduce the risk of defoliation to a sustainable degree.

AB Timber harvest projections for aspen-dominated forests in the prairie region of Canada include a truncation of the current age distribution, whereby old stands of fire origin will become rarer on the landscape, while young, post-harvest stands will increase in abundance. To determine the effects this harvesting strategy might have on communities of breeding forest birds, we conducted point counts in young forests regenerated from clear-cutting (15-25 years), and mature (50-60 years), and old (80-110 years) forests regenerated from fire. Avian species richness was highest in old stands at the point-count station, forest stand, and landscape level. Increased species richness with forest age was associated with increases in the relative abundance of canopy- and cavity-nesting species. At local scales (station and stand), species richness of ground- and shrub-nesting birds was similar among forest age-classes. However, as determined by rarefaction analyses appropriate at the landscape scale, ground-nesting species were more common in young and old forests, while shrub-nesting species were more common in young and mature forests. Density of deciduous shrubs was an important factor influencing the abundance of species like American redstart, Canada warbler, and chestnut-sided warbler. An increase in conifer in old stands resulted in greater use by conifer- or mixedwood associated species such as bay-breasted warbler, magnolia warbler, and ruby-crowned kinglet. Our data indicate that vegetation and structural characteristics such as shrub density should be considered when prescribing sustainable forestry objectives. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB In the beginnings of climate change policy, results from the natural sciences were essential for motivating the establishment of global change diplomacy. At present it is increasingly being recognised that these results must be combined with findings from the social sciences if effective climate policy is to emerge. In particular, participatory techniques for the involvement of stakeholders, ranging from ordinary citizens to business people, are needed. The paper presents the methodology of Integrated Assessment (IA)-Focus Groups, designed primarily for involving citizens in Integrated Assessments of complex issues like climate change. It focuses on collages produced by European IA-Focus Group participants faced with alternative possibilities of energy use. The results suggest that citizens across Europe see strong reductions of current levels of energy use as more desirable than a business-as-usual perspective, Moreover, they indicate that the opinion formation by citizens is by no means restricted to unambiguous stereotypes. We relate these findings to the concept of 'reflexive modernisation', stressing the importance of uncertainty and ambiguity in environmental debates. Implications for representing uncertainty in IA models are discussed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Programme budgeting and marginal analysis (PBMA) is increasingly being used as a method of priority setting in the health care sector. Despite this, PBMA has, on occasions, been subject to problems in its application which can be seen as being 'institutional' in nature. This paper examines the extent to which the institutional setting of PBMA affects the way in which it can be conducted. In particular, a transactions costs perspective is taken to analyse the extent to which variation in such costs can alter the incentives of the individual participants. A number of recommendations for improving the sustainability of such projects is then provided. Following this, the implications which this 'institutional' approach has for the evaluation of PBMA are set out. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

ID EXTRACTIVE RESERVES
AB The importance of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) for forest-dwelling people in the tropics and the relatively small ecological impact of their exploitation has raised high expectations as to their potential to contribute to tropical forest conservation. Three major issues in relation to NTFPs are addressed: their potential to contribute to the conservation of tropical rainforests; their potential to improve the livelihood of forest-dwelling peoples and their potential for participatory forest management. It is concluded that for the proper management of NTFP resources, it is necessary to be specific about the aim of NTFP development and to take account of ecological as well as social and economic factors. Policymaking and land-use planning must furthermore take into account that NTFP extraction is part of an overall livelihood strategy of the people involved, in which other economic activities also play a role.

AB The field experiment was conducted for 2 seasons during 1997-98 and 1998-99 at Padappai to develop a sustainable weed management programme in rainfed cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L). Results revealed that, intercropping of rainfed cotton with soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) and sesame (Sesamum indicum L.) under unweeded plots led to weed suppression substantially by 39.6 and 28.4% respectively. However, the infestation of weeds were found minimum in the plots where soybean is grown as a intercrop in rainfed cotton.

AB A course on 'Disaster Management' is offered to social work students at the Masters level in the Department of Urban and Rural Community Development at the Tata Institute of Social Sciences. The experience of leaching the course has been extremely interesting. Since much of the literature on disaster management is restricted to the post-disaster situation, the course has had to bring in the development perspective in a bid to seek sustainable solutions - be they physical or psychosocial. Hence, the challenge is to prepare the mindset of students to address disaster issues not just on humanitarian and management principles, but with a perspective that includes foresight, relating to the intricacies of development processes, understanding vulnerabilities, and working within the dynamics of the nation state.

   Honduras
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT

DT Article
DE community financing; drugs; cost recovery; management; Bamako initiative
AB In response to UNICEF's Bamako Initiative, hundreds of privately run Community Drug Funds were established in Honduras during the 1990s, generally under the auspices of a non-government organization and usually with the financial assistance of international agencies. Honduras' Community Drug Funds (CDF) are rotating drug funds intended to: (1) serve as a means of increasing access to care in isolated rural populations, (2) promote the more rational use of medicines and (3) promote community participation in the financing and oversight of primary health care activities. This study is the first to analyse empirically the impact and efficiency of these institutions, relying upon primary data obtained from a survey of 51 of the 450 active CDFs in Honduras. Archival data from Ministry of Health and other sources were also analysed. The structure, operations, and impact of CDFs are detailed, with special attention given to access and quality of care issues. The study found that CDFs are rapidly becoming under-capitalized because of basic management problems, principally in pricing and in medicine purchasing practices. These shortcomings, and more generally, increasing financial pressures on NGO sponsors, are negatively affecting quality and access to care. Given the rate of erosion in CDF assets, unless they are recapitalized, the current average estimated lifespan of a CDF is 5.5 years. If these funds are to be sustainable, changes in their financing, training and supervision will be required. In addressing these issues, Honduran health policy-makers must decide how best to balance the competing goals of holding down costs, while maintaining adequate quality and improving access to care.

AB Citrus farmers in the Mekong Delta have a long tradition of managing the weaver ant Oecophylla smaragdina (Fabricius). From 1994 to 1998, insecticide use increased significantly (P < 0.01) from 66% to 84% in orchards where O. smaragdina occurred. In 1998, ca 75% of the sweet orange (Citrus sinensis) and 25% of the Tieu mandarin (C. reticulata) orchards had large O. smaragdina populations, due to lower pesticide pressure in the first crop. In orchards with O. smaragdina, farmers sprayed less frequently and used fewer highly hazardous insecticides. Major insecticides used in sweet orange were monocrotophos and alpha-cypermethrin, and those used in Tieu mandarin were methidathion, imidacloprid and fenpropathrin. Expenditure on pesticides was reduced by half when O. smaragdina was abundant, without affecting either the yield or the farmers' income. Therefore, O. smaragdina husbandry is a good example of a traditional practice which should be further promoted as an important component of sustainable citrus production. The experience of those farmers who use no or few pesticides should be drawn upon in developing farmer training programmes or mass media tools to promote IPM in citrus. Farmers practicing ant husbandry were significantly older than those not doing so.

AB SETTING: Fully supervised chemotherapy or directly observed treatment (DOT), for newly detected smear-positive cases in Beijing, has been successfully implemented for two decades.
   OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the progress made in tuberculosis control, and in particular to evaluate the impact of DOT on tuberculosis epidemiology in Beijing.
   DESIGN: Epidemiological parameters on tuberculosis, consisting of mortality, prevalence, notification rate, tuberculous meningitis in children and initial drug resistance rate, were collected and analysed. Their trends were evaluated and compared with DOT implemented for new smear-positive cases in Beijing from 1978 to 1996.
   RESULTS: The coverage of DOT for new smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis cases has increased from 10% in 1978 to more than 90% since 1990. Since DOT was introduced in 1978, mortality from tuberculosis has declined by an average of more than 7% per year. The prevalence of smear-positive cases decreased from 127/ 100 000 in 1979 to 16/100 000 in 1990, with a mean reduction rate of 17.2%, and the rates of chronic cases and tuberculous meningitis in children decreased dramatically. The rate of newly registered smear-positive cases decreased from 18.9/100 000 in 1986 to 7.3/ 100 000 in 1996, giving an average annual reduction rate of 9.1 during this period. Initial resistance to isoniazid and streptomycin decreased from respectively 13.9% and 12.3% in 1978-1979 to 4.2% and 5.8% by 1996. The level of multidrug resistance was low and stable, at 0.8% in 1996.
   CONCLUSION: The experience of the Beijing tuberculosis control programme convincingly demonstrates that it is possible to improve the epidemiological situation rapidly in a low-income country, at very low cost and in a manner that is self-sufficient and sustainable.

AB 1. Around 10% of recent papers in the Journal of Applied Ecology have examined interactions between birds and agriculture. This statistic reveals the important role now played by ecologists in assessing the effects of agricultural development worldwide. It also reflects the position of birds as both indicators and targets of agricultural change: their patterns of behaviour, distribution, seasonal phenology and demography track closely onto the spatial and temporal scales of agricultural intensification.
   2. Papers in this Special Profile illustrate how research in this sphere has shifted towards assessing the processes by which birds are affected ecologically by agricultural change. The works examine spatial patterns in extinction; assess long-term trends in bird abundance and agricultural practice; reveal how foraging and breeding performance in farmland birds varies between habitats; and evaluate the role of large-scale modelling in examining hypotheses about the influences of land management on birds. The final paper shows that birds can have intrinsically positive value in agricultural systems.
   3. All the papers propose management prescriptions for agricultural areas that blend the microscopic - for example, how to modify local land structure to benefit birds - and the macroscopic - for example, by suggested inputs into land-use policy. Perhaps most pertinent is the key conclusion that agricultural change is multivariate, so that straightforward univariate effects on birds are unlikely. Restoration of impacted populations might therefore require holistic strategies that encourage appropriately scaled agricultural extensification. Success would be most likely if farmers, conservationists and other key players were engaged collaboratively in the process.
   4. Current ideas about restoring farmland bird populations share a common assumption: if agricultural practice has reduced populations hitherto, then agricultural practice can restore the losses. We suggest that this assumption carries a range of predictions that now require testing through sustainable farm management - a situation ideally suited to 'BACI' style experiments.
   5. We reiterate the need to expand work on other groups of organisms affected negatively or positively by agricultural management to allow a broader perspective of impacts or benefits.

AB After nerve-repair grafting of medial gastrocnemius muscle, there is incomplete recovery of specific force and sustainable power, perhaps due to overcompensation by synergistic muscles. We hypothesized that increased workload due to synergist ablation would enhance graft recovery. Contractile and metabolic properties of control and nerve-repair grafted muscles, with and without synergist ablation, were determined after 120 days recovery. Specific force (N/cm(2)) and normalized power (W/kg) were less in the experimental groups compared with controls. Sustained power (W/kg) in the synergist-ablated nerve-repair grafted muscle was higher than nerve-repair grafted muscle, returning to control values. GLUT-4 protein was higher and glycogen content was diminished in both synergist-ablated groups. In summary, synergist ablation did not enhance the recovery of specific force or normalized power, but sustained power did recover, suggesting that metabolic and not mechanical parameters were responsible for this recovery. The enhanced endurance after synergist ablation was accompanied by increased GLUT-4 protein, suggesting a role for increased uptake of circulating glucose during contraction.

AB In Kuwait, an arid country with a low annual average rainfall of about 115 mm, fresh ground-water lenses are found at Raudhatain and Umm Al-Aish fields, in the northern part of the country. These lenses are formed due to a combination of unique conditions that include short duration, high intensity rainfall; geomorphology; and lithology that enables rapid infiltration to the underlying ground-water. Large depressions and playas, paleodrainage patterns, and catchment areas, which are necessary for the accumulation of large amounts of water during flash foods, were mapped from aerial photographs, Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery, and digital elevation model (DEM) datasets. From historical pumping and water quality variation data acquired between 1963 and 1977, the sustainable extraction rate for Raudhatain and Umm Al-Aish is estimated ttl be 5.5 and 3.5 Ml day(-1), respectively. These rates are fundamental to the delicate management required to extract freshwater from the lenses and yet avoid upconing of the deeper saline water.

AB The genus Prosopis contains many N-fixing species throughout the world's semi-arid regions. Previous work with Prosopis glandulosa found that small young trees obtained most of their N from N-fixation, while mature trees that had accumulated 1.3 Mg N ha(-1) in the soil beneath their canopy derived a much smaller percentage of their N from N-fixation. This work examined the percentage of nitrogen derived from nitrogen-fixation (%Ndfa) and soil development as a function of tree size on seven Texas sites. The tree basal diameters ranged from 3.2 cm to 76.4 cm. Leaf and trunk core samples were taken from trees to determine Nj P, and natural abundance ratios of N-15/N-14. Soil samples were taken 75 cm from the trunk and outside the influence of the tree canopy. Soil values for organic C, available P, pH, NO3, NH, and N-15/N-14 were measured. A comparison of N-15/N-14 from background soil parent material and the leaves or trunk was used to estimate the percentage of N derived from N fixation. Increases under canopy over background in soil C, N, and P were significantly correlated with trunk diameter and had maximum values of 17.7 ME ha(-1) for C, 4.4 Mg ha(-1) for N and 13 kg ha(-1) for available P. The soil C/N ratio was negatively correlated with trunk diameter. Leaf concentrations of N and P increased with trunk diameter. The soil N was significantly correlated with leaf N and P, the soil P was significantly correlated with leaf P. The N-15/N-14 ratios of the soil were highly correlated with the N-15/N-14 of the leaves, but were not correlated with the N-15/N-14 ratios of trunk wood. The trunk wood had a much higher % NL-lfa (75%) than the leaves (25%). This difference was to be expected, since the trunk represents the oldest tissues (when the trees obtained most of its N from fixation) while the leaves represent thr current years growth and is coupled with soil N-15/N-14 values. The %Ndfa of the leaves declined significantly with soil nitrate levels as would be expected since the N-fixation process is strongly inhibited by available N. If an increase of 2 Mg ha(-1) soil C could be achieved on the subtropical, semi-arid areas to which Prosopis and Acacia are adapted, 6.2 x 10(9) Mg of carbon would be sequestered. As projected 2010 carbon emissions are 8.5 x 10(9) Mg of carbon, management of tree legumes in arid regions has significant potential to positively impact global C sequestration.

AB With world demand for consumer goods, materials, and energy continuing to spiral upwards, man has become increasingly reliant on finite reserves of fossil fuels. Moreover, as consumption accelerates there is a danger that the net carbon emissions to the atmosphere may result in detrimental effects in future years. Currently, bio-based inputs account for about 2% of all basic building blocks in manufacturing, excluding wood furniture. A goal of a five-fold increase (to 10%) in the use of bio-based renewable resources, by 2020, has been created for the US. One of the proposed priority research components, to help achieve such an increase, is the further application of genomics to the development of novel renewable resources. The concept is that structural and functional genomics should provide gene discovery methods plus an improved ability to understand the genetic base for the regulation of particular natural molecular structures. Additional biotechnology tools may then be used for metabolic engineering of existing pathways, or to transfer discovered genes into large-scale production systems or to transform high-yielding crops.

AB This paper analyzes the determinants of spreads on syndicated bank lending to emerging markets, treating the loan-extension and pricing decisions as jointly determined. Compared to the bond market, our findings highlight the role of international banks in providing credit to smaller borrowers about whom information is least complete and, more generally, support the interpretation of bank finance as dominating that segment of international financial markets characterized by the most pronounced information asymmetries. Domestic lending booms and low reserves in relation to short-term debt have been priced in the expected manner by international banks. The high level of short-term debt in East Asia was supported by high growth rates but was characterized by a knife-edge quality. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

TI High-energy microwave thermotherapy in patients in urinary retention
SO JOURNAL OF ENDOUROLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Purpose: To study the outcome of high-energy transurethral microwave thermotherapy (TUMT) in patients with obstructive benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH),
   Patient and Methods: Between September 1995 and March 1998, patients presenting with urinary retention secondary to BPH were recruited into the study. Their mean age was 67.2 years (range 50-85 years). The mean catheterization time prior to treatment was 3 months (range 15 days-1 year). Among the 200 patients treated during this period, 30 were high anesthesia risk (American Society of Anesthesiologists Class III/IV), The patients were treated in a single 1-hour session using high-energy (Prostatron 2.5) software, the range of energy transmitted being 111.9 to 214.2 kJ (mean 196.3 kJ), Symptoms were scored according to the International Prostatic Symptom Score (IPSS), The mean prostate volume subjected to TUMT was 59 cc (range 40-149.7 cc). The patients were followed every 3 months with measurements of peak flow rate, postvoiding residual urine volume estimation, and IPSS,
   Results: Of the 200 patients, 33 were lost to follow-up, 155 were responsive (catheter free with physiologically acceptable peak flow rate), and 12 (7%) were nonresponsive. Only 4 patients (2%) experienced deterioration in their flow rates during the follow-up period of 2 years. They underwent transurethral resection, High-energy thermotherapy resulted in irritative voiding complaints in 80% of patients for 2 to 4 weeks.
   Conclusion: The initial results were encouraging, and the 2-year follow-up has shown appreciable sustainability in the treatment outcome, particularly in patients at high anesthesia risk.

AB Chalk grasslands are a habitat with high European importance for both flora and fauna. The largest known expanse of unimproved chalk grassland in north-west Europe lies within the Salisbury Plain training area (SPTA) in SW England, where sole use of the land for military training since the end of the nineteenth century has limited the ecologically damaging impacts of modern intensive agriculture. Organisational changes in the British Army may now paradoxically be threatening this unique ecological resource. In this study, historical aerial photograph analysis was carried out for SPTA using images from the 1940s through to the mid 1990s. Image analysis software enabled the creation of a model that analysed the extent and pattern of high intensity military disturbance on SPTA at a local landscape scale. Although trends in disturbance vary across SPTA for the time period under investigation, the average annual increase in bare ground since WWII has been in the region of 25.5ha. These trends indicate that disturbance is occurring at a greater rate than natural regeneration, representing a significant threat to the chalk grassland through habitat loss and fragmentation.

AB Tunas (Scombridae) have been assumed to be among the fastest and most efficient swimmers because they elevate the temperature of the slow-twitch, aerobic locomotor muscle above the ambient water temperature (endothermy) and because of their streamlined body shape and use of the thunniform locomotor mode. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that juvenile tunas swim both faster and more efficiently than their ectothermic relatives. The maximum sustainable swimming speed (U-max, the maximum speed attained while using a steady, continuous gait powered by the aerobic myotomal muscle) and the net cost of transport (COTnet) were compared at 24 degreesC in similar-sized (116-255 mm fork length) juvenile scombrids, an endothermic tuna, the kawakawa (Euthynnus affinis) and the ectothermic chub mackerel (Scomber japonicus), U-max and COTnet were measured by forcing individual fish to swim in a temperature-controlled, variable-speed swimming tunnel respirometer, There were no significant interspecific differences in the relationship between U-max and body mass or fork length or in the relationship between COTnet and body mass or fork length. Muscle temperatures were elevated by 1.0-2.3 degreesC and 0.1-0.6 degreesC above water temperature in the kawakawa and chub mackerel, respectively. The juvenile kawakawa had significantly higher standard metabolic rates than the chub mackerel, because the total rate of oxygen consumption at a given swimming speed was higher in the kawakawa when the effects of fish size were accounted for. Thus, juvenile kawakawa are not capable of higher sustainable swimming speeds and are not more efficient swimmers than juvenile chub mackerel.

AB In 1997, the Royal Dutch/Shell Group made a public commitment to contribute to sustainable development (SD) and has since undertaken extensive work to rum this into practical reality and integrate the concept into business activities. Shell E&P produced a framework to guide development of the business in line with the SD concept. The cornerstone of the approach is six sustainability principles, applicable from corporate to site level. Each Shell E&P operating company has used the principles to frame a strategy and assess its own course and contribution to SD, reflecting individual company operating environments, cultures, and stakeholder values. This paper provides a background to the approach developed and discusses progress to date. Examples from several Shell operating companies illustrate how SD considerations are being integrated into activities and how work is being taken forward. The focus is on ways that the E&P business can contribute toward sustainability goals. Movement by E&P companies into other energy sectors, such as renewables, is not considered.

AB In the development of single-dose microparticulate vaccines, identification of the type of protein release profile required to elicit high and sustainable immune responses is important. Microparticles exhibiting different protein release profiles (continuous, pulsatile and plateau) were made by solvent evaporation or solvent extraction methods from biodegradable polymers encapsulating the model antigen, bovine serum albumin (BSA). The immune responses obtained after a single intranasal or intramuscular administration of microparticles were determined, and also after a subcutaneous boost after 11 months.
   Microparticles were manufactured with acceptable protein loading and average volume size ranging from 1 to 10 mum. The integrity of BSA extracted and released from microparticles after 2 months incubation was retained. Microparticulate preparations administered by either intranasal or intramuscular routes, evoked rapid, high titre and long-lived (up to 11 months after priming) specific serum IgG responses which were significantly greater than for free BSA. The type of protein release from microparticles had no significant effect on the systemic immune responses. Interestingly, a formulation exhibiting a plateau-release profile was the only microparticulate system capable of inducing significantly greater IgA responses than free BSA after intranasal immunization.
   This study shows the benefit of microencapsulation in inducing high and long-lasting systemic immune responses after a single dose by both parenteral and mucosal delivery. We conclude that of the microparticles tested, the longevity and magnitude of humoral responses was not effected by the type of in-vitro protein release profile.

Nonetheless, the concept of sustainable rural communities' is embedded in popular, policy and academic discourses, where the needs of 'rural communities' are usually equated with those of farm families. Our ethnographic research in Northland, New Zealand illustrates the diverse interests to be found within 'rural communities'. Interviews and participant observation were undertaken between August 1995 and July 1996 in the Mangakahia Valley. The increasing divergence in the ethnic, class and occupational makeup of the population has brought with it complexities in terms of what can be said to contribute to 'sustainable rural communities'. We suggest that 'sustainable rural communities' be treated as a folk category, and instead, social science discourse should resort to the broader concept of social sustainability, which will have a locally defined content, not a universal definition, but will include elements of livelihood, social participation, justice and equity.

AB We compared the population dynamics of two geographically discrete stocks of rock sole (Lepidopsetta bilineata) one in the Bering Sea off Alaska near the centre of the geographic range and the other in Hecate Strait off British Columbia near the southern limit of the species' range. Rock sole in Hecate Strait had a higher rate of growth and natural mortality, matured earlier and had a higher reproductive potential than rock sole in the Baring Sea. The difference in the temperature regime probably contributes to the slower growth rate and longer time to maturity for the Bering Sea stock. There was evidence of density dependence in the relationship between spawners and recruits mitigated by ocean temperature for both stocks. Productivity declined at high stock sizes. We suggest that, in the case of rock sole in Hecate Strait density dependence could result from competition for food and habitat at the larval and juvenile stages. The species exhibits highly localised spawning which results in increased competition for a very limited food resource and prime habitat, In the case of Bering Sea rock sole production at high stock densities was impaired more than it was in Hecate Strait. This may have severe long-term consequences especially if environmental conditions are unfavourable for recruitment. We examined the effect of temperature at the time of spawning on subsequent recruitment for both stocks, plots of temperature recorded at the time of egg and larval development vs, subsequent recruitment in the Bering Sea did not show a discernible relationship, although it was a significant component in a Ricker formulation of spawner-recruit analysis. Temperature had a moderating influence on rock sole year-class strength in Hecate Strait but could not be considered a controlling factor. There was no synchrony in year-class strength between the two stocks suggesting that the two stocks an responding differently to environmental forcing factors and/or differences in spawning stock biomass. Target fishing mortality reference points for F-0.1 and F-med were higher for the rock sole stock in Hecate Strait than for the Bering Sea stock. Similarly, higher yield was associated with a given rate of fishing mortality for the Hecate Strait stock compared to the Bering Sea stock. A fixed target fishing mortality reference point that is sustainable for the Hecate Strait stock could result in an overfishing situation and a significant decline in abundance for the Bering Sea stock. The highest sustainable yield occurred at a fishing rate slightly above F-0.1 for both stocks. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

ID EMISSIONS
AB We examine the life cycles of gasoline, diesel, compressed natural gas (CNG), and ethanol (C2H5OH)-fueled internal combustion engine (ICE) automobiles. Port and direct injection and spark and compression ignition engines are examined. We investigate diesel fuel from both petroleum and biosources as well as C2H5OH from corn, herbaceous bio-mass, and woody biomass. The baseline vehicle is a gasoline-fueled 1998 Ford Taurus. We optimize the other fuel/powertrain combinations for each specific fuel as a part of making the vehicles comparable to the baseline in terms of range, emissions level, and vehicle lifetime. Life-cycle calculations are done using the economic input-output lifecycle analysis (EIO-LCA) software; fuel cycles and vehicle end-of-life stages are based on published model results.
   We find that recent advances in gasoline vehicles, the low petroleum price, and the extensive gasoline infrastructure make it difficult for any alternative fuel to become commercially viable. The most attractive alternative fuel is compressed natural gas because it is less expensive than gasoline, has lower regulated pollutant and toxics emissions, produces less greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and is available in North America in large quantities. However, the bulk and weight of gas storage cylinders required for the vehicle to attain a range comparable to that of gasoline vehicles necessitates a redesign of the engine and chassis. Additional natural gas transportation and distribution infrastructure is required for large-scale use of natural gas for transportation. Diesel engines are extremely attractive in terms of energy efficiency, but expert judgment is divided on whether these engines will be able to meet strict emissions standards, even with reformulated fuel. The attractiveness of direct injection engines depends on their being able to meet strict emissions standards without losing their greater efficiency. Biofuels offer lower GHG emissions, are sustainable, and reduce the demand for imported fuels. Fuels from food sources, such as biodiesel from soybeans and C2H5OH from corn, can be attractive only if the co-products are in high demand and if the fuel production does not diminish the food supply C2H5OH from herbaceous or woody biomass could replace the gasoline burned in the light-duty fleet while supplying electricity as a co-product. While it costs more than gasoline, bioethanol would be attractive if the price of gasoline doubled, if significant reductions in GHG emissions were required, or if fuel economy regulations for gasoline vehicles were tightened.

ID DEMAND
AB This study examines water consumption characteristics in Casablanca and analyzes approaches for sustainable water demand management. Research procedures involve the development and estimation of water demand models for the residential/commercial, industrial, and institutional sectors; forecasts of water demand to 2010; and simulation of the effects of a complex of water conservation methods on the forecasted demands. The results indicate that residential/commercial water demand its weakly responsive to price changes (elasticity = -0.448) while institutional water demand is slightly more responsive (elasticity = -0.648). The conservation approaches used in the simulations included public education, plumbing code revisions to require use of water conservation devices, leak detection and repair, pricing policy, metering, and pressure reduction. The results indicate that considerable saving in water use can be attained through a comprehensive water demand management program.

TI Hydrologic analysis of discharge sustainability from an abandoned
   underground coal mine
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION
LA English

DE springflow; mine-discharge; karst systems; correlation analysis
AB Discharge from flooded abandoned subsurface coal mines is considered a potential source for water supplies where other acceptable water sources are not available. The objective of this study was to develop procedures for determining sustainability of mine-water discharge using rainfall and discharge data for a case study site. The study site is located in southwest Virginia where Late Paleozoic sequences of sandstone, coal, and shale predominate. A rain gauge and a flow rate monitoring system were installed at the site and data were collected for a period of 100 days. The recording period corresponded with one of the driest periods in recent years and, therefore, provided valuable information regarding the flow sustainability during baseflow conditions. From available data on underground mining patterns, geology, and ground water flow regimes, it was determined that a coal mine aquifer exhibits hydraulic characteristics very similar to the extremely heterogeneous systems observed in karst aquifers, and the mine discharge is analogous to springflow. Thus, techniques commonly used in karst-water systems and springflow analysis were used to develop rainfall/mine-discharge relationships. Springflow recession analysis was performed on five rainfall recessions and the coefficient for each recession was compared and interpreted in light of known geologic information. It was found that the recession coefficients described the mine discharge adequately and the mine aquifer response to a rainfall pulse was very similar to the response from certain ts;pes of karst aquifers. A cross-correlation analysis was performed to verify the results of the recession analysis and to develop a "black box" statistical model for discharge data. The correlation analysis proved the validity of springflow recession analysis for mine discharge. The recorded data length was not adequate to create a statistical model, however, but a procedure was proposed for a statistical model that could be used with large flow records. For the study site, the mine discharge was found to be sustainable for a prolonged period of time.

TI Sustainable estuarine development? Cumulative impact study of the Humber
SO JOURNAL OF THE CHARTERED INSTITUTION OF WATER AND ENVIRONMENTAL
   MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE Humber; modelling; special protection area; sustainability
AB Consideration of sustainability principles and the assessment of impacts from multiple developments on sensitive estuarine and coastal environments are emerging factors in the planning of coastal infrastructure. Concurrent planning of four large schemes at Saltend on the Humber (including Hull sewage-treatment works, a power station, a ferry terminal and reclamation, and flood-defence works) dictated that a cumulative impact study should be carried out. Discussions with regulatory authorities established several issues of potential concern, including the integrity of the adjacent 'special protection area' (birds and ecology), estuarine flows, sediment movement and water quality and construction traffic. Detailed baseline monitoring and predictive modelling concluded that there were likely to be no significant impacts, provided that appropriate inter-scheme construction phasing and coordinated application of a suite of mitigation measures were included. Adopting the precautionary principle, continued monitoring, and review over a 3-5 year period were agreed as part of the planning process, coordinated by the planning authorities and regulators.

DT Article
DE Natural Areas; whole countryside approach; biodiversity; sustainable
   agriculture; common agricultural policy
ID BRITAIN
AB Natural Areas are biogeographical zones which reflect the geological foundation, the natural systems and processes, and the wildlife in different parts of England, and provide a framework for setting objectives for nature conservation. This paper argues, with particular reference to agro-ecosystems, that there is a need for an integrated, whole countryside approach to Natural Areas based on the principles of 'strong' sustainable development. In practice, this means the delineation of conservation objectives for the whole of each Natural Area and the application of policy instruments designed to address the causes of environmental loss and deterioration. The latter requires, it is argued, a structural analysis of generic environmental issues. A generic issues approach is required in order to avoid the pitfalls of environmental 'symptom management' (environmental managerialism), an approach which dominates current environmental and agri-environmental policy. Necessary as such discrete action programmes and measures may be as short-term 'fire-fighting' responses to immediate threats, environmental managerialism as a policy framework epitomises a non-holistic and 'disintegrated' approach to nature conservation. The paper goes on to discuss the configuration of agri-environmental policy that will be required to address generic agricultural impacts on biodiversity and the constraints and opportunities for its implementation that are likely to arise within the context of further CAP reform and the forthcoming round of WTO negotiations.

AB The issues of sustainable development of natural resources are being more and more accepted as second to none in the corporate objectives of profit, technology, cost of operations and, customer goodwill etc. This is because the constituency of the stakeholders in sustainable development is more than that of the shareholders of a company. The changes associated with the policies of sustainable mineral development will have seen metamorphosis of the greatest order for the industry hitherto unseen. It is thus necessary to understand the substantive development in the concepts and practices in sustainable development as well as to attempt for a framework of strategies for the mineral industry.

AB There are twin pressures mounting in US industry for increased utilization of biomass feedstocks and biotechnology in production. The more demanding pressure relates to economic sustainability, that is, because of increased competition globally, businesses will fail unless a minimum margin of profit is maintained while meeting the demands of consumers for less expensive products. The second pressure relates to "Green Technology" where environmental sustainability, linked for example to concerns about climate change and the preservation of natural resources, represents a worldwide driving force to reduce the consumption of fossil hydrocarbons. The resulting transition of biomass production in the industrial plant, as opposed to the agricultural plant, has resulted in an increasing need for isotopic methods of authenticating and dating feedstocks, intermediates and industrial products. The research described represents a prototypical case study leading to the definition of a unique dual isotopic (C-13, C-14) signature or "fingerprint" for a new biomass-based commercial polymer, polypropylene terephthalate (3GT).

ID STABILITY
AB Gross plasma stability can derive from plasma compressibility in the bad curvature regions of closed field line systems. In this situation magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) theory predicts that the maximum pressure gradient that is stable is proportional to gamma, the ratio of specific heats. This article will examine the accuracy of the MHD prediction for electrostatic interchange modes using kinetic theory. The maximum sustainable pressure gradient is found to be dependent on the ratio of the temperature and density gradients (eta equivalent to(n/T)(del T/del n)) as well as on the ion gyro-radius scale length. For eta=2/3 the MHD stability condition is reproduced. When eta deviates from 2/3 the mode changes character and the stability criterion becomes more stringent.

SO RENEWABLE ENERGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Limited fossil resources and environmental problems require new sustainable energy supply options, that use renewable energies and are economic at the same lime. Solar Thermal Electricity (STE) generating systems are proven renewable energy technologies and often a very cost effective way to produce electricity from solar radiation.
   In India, the electricity demand is drastically increasing. At the same time, solar resources and large wasteland areas are widely available. These factors together make India an ideal country for the implementation of STE-technologies.
   In this paper, we analyze the potential and the cost-effectiveness of centralized and decentralized STE-generation in India. Comparing the levelized electricity costs (LEC) for STE with the corresponding LEC for the electricity generating options used at present, we find that STE is an economically viable technology under favorable conditions, i.e, in areas with high insolation levels and provided that capital is available at low interest rates.

AB This paper addresses the optimal long-term management of an accumulative but assimilable pollutant through economic incentive policies that restrict more damaging production processes and induce more benign alternatives. Using a simple general equilibrium approach, we consider the possibility that the assimilative capacity of the environment is eventually exhausted by pollution accumulation. In this case, there is a nonconvexity in the problem that gives rise to multiple potential optima; environmental quality may be preserved or completely degraded in the long term. We characterize the circumstances under which phasing out dirty production is consistent with an intertemporally optimizing path and we discuss the design of price-based and quantity-based policies for supporting an optimal solution with the nonconvexity.

AB Canada's Model Forest Program was established as a means of implementing concepts of sustainable forest manage me nt. An initial step to achieving this is understand stakeholders' forest values and attitudes. A study was undertaken to examine forest values and attitudes toward forest management of campers and hunters in the Foothills Model Forest of Alberta within the context of a cognitive hierarchy model. Data were collected by mail survey in 1996. Campers and hunters were primarily biocentric in their forest values orientation. These groups supported protection-oriented management strategies, were not in favor of economic development and timber-oriented strategies, and did not believe that current forest management is sustainable. Socioeconomic factors, social influences, and knowledge had little influence on values or attitudes. Forest values were related strongly to attitudes providing support for the cognitive hierarchy model.

TI Integrating agri-environment policy farming systems and rural
   development: Tir Cymen in Wales
SO SOCIOLOGIA RURALIS
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper examines a conservation scheme in Wales called Tir Cymen (tidy land in Welsh) as a means of exploring the extent to which policies designed primarily to support habitat, landscape, biodiversity and conservation are commensurate with goals to maintain viable rural communities, including viable agricultures. Maximizing the broader rural development impacts of conservation schemes, it is argued, is a vital ingredient in the pursuit of sustainable rural development, particularly in regions where many farm businesses are likely to be already highly dependent upon subsidy support. It is argued, through the presentation of the Tir Cymen case, that conservation policies can, if appropriately designed and regionally embedded, go some way to mitigating both the 'farm problem' and the 'rural problem', and are therefore capable of a sustainable and desirable rural development impact commensurate with the new rural development paradigm.

TI Pluriactivity as a livelihood strategy in Irish farm households and its
   role in rural development
SO SOCIOLOGIA RURALIS
LA English
DT Article
AB Within the European Union, Ireland is one of the countries that has a veri high number of farms where the farm operator and/or spouse works outside the family farm. The role of off-farm employment in the viability of Irish farm households is central to both farming and the sustainability of rural communities. This article examines the importance of pluriactive farm households at both local and regional levels by refering to cases studies drawn From the West of Ireland. It shows that off-farm work by Irish farm families is neither a new phenomenon nor purely the result of economic necessity. It also indicates the considerable socio-economic and environmental importance of pluriactivity. The article concludes by relating the realities of pluriactivity to the future rural and agricultural policy of the European Union. It suggests that the growing role of pluriactivity for farm households should be viewed more as a key strategy in the maintenance of a 'living countryside' than as an indicator of conventional agriculture's failure to sustain farming populations.

AB Reflecting on three phases of action research involving a large Canadian natural resource organization in its relevant environments, this article argues that, to be sustainable, cultural change in an organization must be directively correlated with change in the organization's environments. A brief case description and open systems analysis highlight how a local management lacking some conceptual rigor can collude with a shift in macroeconomic policy to produce confusion between laissez-faire and democratization. The analysis provides implications for Future practice.

ID INNOVATIONS
AB There are numerous reasons why landusers do not always adopt innovations. For different landuse enterprises and for different innovations, different constraints will apply and these can be organised into three broad categories. The first is characterised by the landuser and the adoption process. The second emphasises the characteristics of the innovation itself and issues associated with the developers of the innovation. The third area deals with the role of extension agents and the transfer process. It is apparent that technology transfer and adoption in sustainable landuse is largely being led by commercial organisations. Landusers are being recognised as key stakeholders in both the adoption and technology development processes. Furthermore, community groups and a range of government and NGOs are becoming involved as major stakeholders in the transfer and adoption of sustainable landuse practices. The study, however, reveals a shortage of data on the effectiveness of corporations and other commercial organisations on the technology transfer and adoption processes. Future research is needed on the following: understanding the effectiveness of group-based approaches to technology transfer and adoption; determining and predicting rates of adoption of sustainable practices; the ongoing effectiveness of different forms of media; evaluating existing efforts of technology transfer and adoption particularly related to land management practices; and understanding the constraints to adoption associated with an aging landusing population.

DE Malta; tourism development; golf; land-use; stakeholders; discourse;
   sustainability
AB As one of the most rapidly expanding types of extensive land-use, golf course development has often attracted controversy when proposed as a policy to promote special-interest tourism. PI Malta is an extreme case in which such conflicts have arisen, being one of the world's most densely populated countries and having limited land and water resources. Focusing on the disputes arising from Malta's golf development proposals, this paper examines stakeholders' arguments in the context of contemporary concerns about sustainability. Using interview narratives and newspaper reports, the paper unpacks the different discourses involved to reveal some surprising collaboration as well as conflict. The paper points to the difficulties of generalised conceptualisation of such development conflicts, suggesting stakeholder mapping of power-interest matrices as a way forward by which tourism scholars and managers may interpret the complex relationships involved.

TI Community capacity building as an opportunity for sustainable land
   management: Lessons from Ndome and Ghazi in Taita-Taveta district, Kenya
SO TROPENLANDWIRT
LA English
DT Article
AB The prevalence of land degradation particularly in developing countries would suggest that sustainability has remained more in the conceptual phase and not been transformed into a problem solving aid/tool. In this paper, which is based on an erosion study of 1996-1999 in semi-arid Ndome and Ghazi agro-ecosystems in Taita-Taveta, Kenya, it is argued that failure to develop capacities of individual land users for problem solving is the root cause of this problem. Further, targeting community needs and priorities within the domain of poverty alleviation presents the most practical entry point towards sustainable land management. It was concluded that effective management of land users through community capacity building (CCB) is the single most important entry point in this endeavour. What constitutes CCB and its role in a functional model towards sustainable land management is the gist of this paper.

DE biodiversity; conservation; ecosystems; gene banks; Israel
AB Despite the overwhelming importance of biodiversity and the growing demand for the genes and chemicals, biodiversity is being lost at alarming rates, largely as a result of human action enhancing degradation of biologically rich ecosystems like tropical rain forests, grassland and coral reefs. A positive global change was achieved at the Earth Summit in Rio, 1992, requiring all nations to take four basic steps: develop national strategies for conservation, establish a system of protected areas, begin to rehabilitate damaged ecosystems and integrate conservation policy into national decision making. The conservation of biological diversity, sustainable use, technology transfer, intellectual property rights, provision of financing and the principle of equitable sharing of benefits were also promoted.
   On the local scene, Israel is known for its rich natural vegetation and diversified species which contribute to the biological diversity and plant species population. Beyond the intrinsic value, the diversified plant population is an extremely valuable genetic source for improvement of agricultural crops and extraction of new drugs. The Israeli Gene Bank (IGB) was established to preserve the natural endowment, and is responsible for in-situ conservation, formation of gene banks and other related activities with emphasis on regional and international cooperation.

TI The use of economic instruments and green taxes to complement an
   environmental regulatory regime
SO WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION
LA English
DT Article
DE economic instruments complementary to command and control regimes; green
   taxes
AB In 1999, some countries are developing and effectively applying economic instruments for environmental protection and natural resource management, whilst others are relying on command and control regulatory procedures under-enforced by sometimes inadequately trained and motivated enforcement officers. This paper considers the current and future role of economic instruments as policy instruments for use by governments. In many developed countries, past over-regulation allied to a serious shortfall of experienced environmental enforcers required regulatory regimes to be supplemented by well targeted economic instruments and green taxes. Their application to countries which do not have developed environmental control systems is more questionable. The purported threats of the longer term effects of global warming, damage to the ozone layer and an apparent loss of biodiversity have led environmentalists to adopt the so-called precautionary principle. Sustainable development has added to the pressures for further national and transfrontier legislation. The challenge facing policymakers, therefore, is to design policies to enable market forces to operate in the environmental sphere, for example through a system of pollution charges, principally intended to promote greater environmental efficiency. These charging systems can be of many kinds but their main defining feature is their reliance on markets and the price mechanism to internalise environmental externalities, thereby attempting to make polluters pay through facing the full social costs of their activities. Some of the applications of these charging systems, financial and fiscal instruments and tradable emission systems are explained and illustrated.

AB This paper traces the history of the contamination of Sydney's water supply between July and September 1998, its impact and consequences. Routine testing found persistently high readings of Cryptosporidium and Giardia in the water supply. After initial official inactivity, health warnings were issued leading to comprehensive boil water alerts. The paper examines the issues of scientific uncertainty and the response of the Government to the crisis. In particular, the paper examines the establishment and course of the Sydney Water Inquiry, chaired by Peter McClellan, QC, which delivered its final report in December 1998. The recommendations of the Inquiry are assessed, in particular the establishment of an independent catchment management authority, augmentation of treatment processes, and upgraded monitoring and research. Implementation of the recommendations by the Government by legislative and executive act is also addressed. Finally, the lessons to be learned are discussed, especially care of the catchment and restrictions on certain types of development within it. Postcript: Amazingly, no one got sick!

AB The first half of this paper discusses the development of sustainability law. It takes as its basis that environmental law plays a central role in the achievement of sustainable development and that environmental lawyers and those from associated disciplines must come to terms with the imperatives of the internationally accepted concept of sustainable development. The second half of the paper deals with the implications of sustainability law for the teaching of environmental law, including the need to further liberate environmental law from the confines of law schools and lawyers, and to make it part of the common discourse of government, business and communities at large. A number of current initiatives in environmental legal education and training are canvassed, focussing on the Asia Pacific region.

AB Sustainability has become a focal topic and important goal for many people concerned about environmental issues. It is, therefore, important for educators, and others, to talk about sustainability with their students and colleagues-about its meaning, curricular application, and practice. However, I do not think this is sufficient. In this paper I will examine limitations of the language of sustainability and implications for environmental thinking.
   Before launching into a critique, I do acknowledge the importance of "sustainability" and the usefulness of this concept. Many ecological processes are not sustained-not kept going continuously. Species are going extinct at an alarming rate and whole ecosystems are at risk. So, sustainability is important. However, we must also pay attention to what sustainability is not. And, we should consider why these limitations matter.
   For example, "education for sustainability" has gained rapid acceptance, yet little critical attention has been given to the term. Just as many environmental educators have expressed reservations about "education for sustainable development," I believe there are serious problems associated with allowing our work to be subsumed by the term "education for sustainability." In this presentation I will explore reasons for educators, and others, to be concerned about relying on the language and goals of sustainability. These areas of concern, or limitations, are discussed in terms of determinism, exclusivity, and conceptualization. Some suggestions are provided to help refocus our direction.

AB The Thailand Ministry of Education and Michigan State University collaborated to plan, design, implement, and evaluate this project in which school children and adults in 11 communities worked together to prevent forest degradation and improve forest quality. School children in grades 5 though 8 studied the causes and consequences of deforestation and forest degradation and brought the results of their investigations to local community members. This resulted in identification of local environmental problems that were forest-related and joint efforts in which adults and children worked together to resolve these problems. The results of this intergenerational work were very promising as children, adults, schools, communities, and the environment benefited from collaboration. Important lessons for others embarking this work are reported.

DE curriculum; course development; pollution prevention; waste
   minimization; green engineering; design for the environment
AB It is estimated that our materials-dominated society consumes about 10 metric tons of raw materials per person per year in the production of consumer goods. Within 6 months of extraction or production of these materials, 94% of them become waste. More efficient manufacturing practices are needed to lessen the demands for raw materials and to reduce the amounts and toxicity of waste materials. It is estimated that 70% of this waste material could be eliminated through better design decisions and reuse of materials. Engineering education has evolved into fairly segregated disciplines which focus on narrowly defined design and manufacturing functions, often without consideration of the environmental consequences of these functions. This is no longer the case in industry, however, where pollution prevention and waste minimization have become very important. Unfortunately, most of our engineering graduates are not prepared to step into a role where "green engineering" principles are espoused. We must quickly incorporate the "green engineering" principles into the engineering curriculum in all disciplines to ensure that all engineering graduates understand the environmental and economic consequences of engineering decisions. This paper describes methods that can be used to introduce the principles of pollution prevention, environmentally conscious products, processes and manufacturing systems. Students will learn the impacts of wastes from manufacturing and post-use product disposal, environmental cycles of materials, sustainability, and principles of environmental economics. Materials selection, process and product design, and packaging are also addressed.

AB Unlike most Middle East countries which are highly dependent on water from sources originating in other countries or on desalination, Turkey is naturally endowed with relatively abundant water resources. The Turkish government has assigned the highest priority to completing its massive $32 billion Southeastern Anatolia Project (GAP), consisting of 22 dams and 19 hydroelectric power plants on the Euphrates and Tigris rivers. Scheduled for completion in 2005, GAP will generate 27 billion kilowatt hours of hydroelectric power and will divert water from the Atat rk Dam reservoir through the two giant Sanliurfa Tunnels into a canal system to irrigate 1.7 million hectares in south-eastern Anatolia just north of the Syrian border. For Turkey, GAP will not only provide food and energy for a growing population, but is the crux of a comprehensive and sustainable economic development plan designed to end instability and reduce out-migration by radically transforming the feudal economic and social structure of this poor and largely Kurdish inhabited region of the country. Syria and Iraq, the downstream riparians in the Tigris-Euphrates Basin, also have rapidly growing populations and ambitious development plans. They contend that GAP will greatly diminish and degrade their water supply in future years. The severe current drought conditions in Syria and Iraq have added urgency to their demands for a greater share of the rivers' flow. This article examines the legal, political, military and technological strategies employed by the parties to advance their interests. After reviewing efforts to achieve a negotiated solution, we examine various Turkish proposals to foster regional peace by exporting water from other Turkish rivers to Cyprus, Israel, the Gaza Strip, Jordan, and other Arab countries.

AB It has been assumed that marine habitats and resources, especially, are almost unlimited, and that if one habitat became degraded or a particular fisheries resource depleted, there always would be another to replace it. Therefore, natural resource management principals are beginning to include human motivation and responses as part of the marine and coastal systems that are being studied and managed. Managers of marine resources face the challenge of balancing conservation and development objectives in the context of the inherent uncertainty of natural systems and the political and social pressures of human systems. Natural resource managers, scientists and the general public seem to share a vision for the future as a world in which societal and economic decisions will be strongly coupled with an increasingly comprehensive understanding of the environment. This in turn will lead to both socio-economic health and ecosystem health. A paradigm shift is being seen in the evolution of the role of scientists in society from simply observers of the natural world with tenuous linkages to resource managers and the public, to partners in modern society's quest for answers to pressing questions related to sustainable use and conservation of natural resources. A US Agency for International Development supported, joint effort between the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Government of Israel and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan to conduct a comprehensive research and monitoring program directed at the new Binational Red Sea Marine Pearce Park will be a pioneering effort to employ and test this new paradigm.

TI Strategic issues in modelling for integrated water resource management
   in Southern Africa
SO WATER SA
LA English
DT Article
AB In Southern Africa the practice of the water resource management has moved in step with the societal needs of the regions over the past several decades. These needs have passed through phases which placed most emphasis on "getting more water", then "using water more efficiently". Whilst these issues are still important the dominant theme now is "allocating water equitably". A new era has begun. The need to broaden participation and, thereby, democratise the process of water allocation is fundamental to peaceful and sustainable progress in Southern Africa. This need is urgent in a region so beset with conflict and inequalities which exacerbate the already complex situation surrounding the sustainable development of scarce water resources. To meet the challenges of this era, substantial paradigm changes are required from modellers, if they are to fulfil their potential in the region.
   This paper commences with a brief examination of the compelling forces acting on water management in Southern Africa. The illumination of these forces provides insights into the processes which are encouraging modellers to now consider the computer science, business science and social science contexts of their work in addition to their traditional domain of focus which was restricted to the science of water.
   Of foremost importance in any social process in communication and relationships. The relevance of these for water resource modelling is outlined. The water allocation process and hence modellers are being squeezed by the forces calling for specialisation and integration at the same time. This paper draws lessons from industries which are generically similar to the water resources modelling industry, in the business sense, and offers guidance to modellers in this dilemma.
   It is taken as axiomatic that integrated water resource management cannot be founded on a base of dis-integrated science. Simultaneously, the point is made that no single discipline or institution can accomplish integrated water resource management alone. Developing inter-operability between models and systems is, therefore, a key strategic issue which is discussed. The paper also includes strategic thoughts on the issues of model complexity and modelling-led monitoring.
   The paper concludes with the view that modellers in Southern Africa face some key paradigm changes. These must be embraced with urgency if water resource simulation modelling is to achieve its potential to make a contribution to the social process of water allocation in Southern Africa.

AB An investigation was undertaken into the bioaccumulation of Cr, Cu and Fe in the gills, liver, muscle and skin of the fish Clarias gariepinus from two sites on the Olifants River in the Kruger National Park. During 1994, four surveys (February, May, July and November) were undertaken. Metal bioaccumulation was analysed using atomic absorption spectrophotometry and was then applied to differentiate between the concentrations found at the two locations, and between all of the surveys. The greatest concentration of Cr was detected in the gills, suggesting that this was the prime site of absorption and loss of Cr to and from the aquatic environment. The concentrations of Cu and Fe were highest in the liver, which is a storage and detoxification organ for metal, followed by the gills. Mamba and Balule generally showed very little difference in the concentration of bioaccumulated metal. However, the gills as in the case of Cr generally showed high concentrations at Mambai while the liver as in the case of Fe, showed consistently higher concentrations at Balule. The possible effects that temperature, pH, hardness-and salinity have on the individual metals, as well as bioaccumulation of these metals, are discussed in detail. The continuous monitoring of the quality of water in the Olifants River is imperative for the future sustainability of the Kruger National Park.

AB For a variety of reasons, stickies levels in recovered papers are going to increase still further as recovered paper utilisation rates are going up. The recycling industry will have to meet this challenge in the years ahead.
   Significant progress has been achieved in separating techniques and,in screening in particular so that papermakers today are able to remove macrostickies from stock suspensions with high efficiency. Microstickies by comparison - i. e. particles in the size range below 100 pm are becoming ever more critical in production processes. They are present as primary stickies in recovered papers and they may develop as secondary stickies as a result of chemical reactions in the stock preparation stage. State-of-the-art separating equipment currently only enables part of the microstickies to be removed. It is basically possible to restrict paper machine failures by masking the microstickies with chemical aids, but microsized material nevertheless fends to enter the mill water loops. Modern microflotation, pressurized filtration and membrane filtration technologies provide sustainable solution concepts for microstickies control.
   The presentation outlines and critically evaluates the available methods for separating and passivating stickies as part of recovered paper treatment.

AB The 20-year old Afghan conflict has created an open war economy, affecting Afghanistan and surrounding areas. Not only has Afghanistan become the world's largest opium producer and a center for arms dealing, but it supports a multibillion dollar trade in goods smuggled from Dubai to Pakistan. This criminalized economy funds both the Taliban and their adversaries. It has transformed social relations and weakened states and legal economies throughout the region. Sustainable peace will require not just an end to fighting and a political agreement but a regional economic transformation that provides alternative forms of livelihood and promotes accountability.

AB More funding must be made available to scientists in developing countries and to organisations that support in-country training and research
   Genuine partnership and mutual trust is a prerequisite for the sustainable transfer of technology from developed to developing countries
   Building local scientific capacity and long term North-South and South-South partnerships are important in establishing effective health research programmes
   Research topics should have local relevance and priority, and technology transfer should be participatory equitable, and sustained
   Autonomous research centres attract funding and reduce administrative burdens.

SO FIELD CROPS RESEARCH

DT Article
DE sugar; model; methodology; system performance
AB This paper demonstrates the capability of the model, APSIM-Sugarcane to analyse system performance, by consideration of crop production and related issues for two contrasting sugarcane production systems in northern Australia. Daily output data from short-term model runs are used to demonstrate the capability of the model to represent the diverse management of sugarcane crops encountered in Australia. Output from longer term simulations is used to investigate a number of 'real life' sustainability issues, including an assessment of the production risk associated with season to season climate variability at each site, and the long-term implications of crop residue management on system performance. The paper also develops guidelines for methodological issues in long-term simulations of sugarcane production systems, relating to (1) the length of the climate record necessary to capture the 'true' season to season variability, (2) the need or otherwise to simulate each crop class (i.e. plant and ratoon crops) over the full climate record, and (3) the impact of initial soil conditions on the time for the system to reach a state ol: equilibrium. Results from statistical tears comparing pairs of distributions for various simulation run lengths, identified significant differences for run lengths up to 40 years. This suggests that, while adequate for most scenarios, the current practice of basing sugarcane simulations on 40 years' climate data will not always capture the true season to season variability in response to climate. Results showed that variability associated with season to season climate by management interactions can be adequately captured in a single model run comprised of consecutive crop cycles, without the need to represent every crop class in every year. These findings have the potential to significantly improve modelling efficiency by reducing model run times, simplifying the analysis of model output and, reducing the required computer storage space. Results from long-term simulations, for some model output variables, indicate there is likely to be an initial period of 'settling in' of between 5 and 10 years as the model approaches a state of equilibrium, during which the response of certain model variables will be 'abnormal' and should be used with caution or discarded.

AB Environmental concerns and regulations are getting more and more severe. A lot of efforts and progress have been accomplished in the environmentally benign and sustainable industrial manufacture of fine and intermediate chemicals in recent years. Solid acid-base catalyzed commercialized processes as well as heterogeneously catalyzed oxidation processes and a dehydrogenation process are reviewed.
   The examples for acid catalyzed processes are the BASF-tert.-butylamine-process and the Beckmann-rearrangment to form epsilon -caprolactam. For solid base catalyzed processes, the Sumitomo-process for the production of 5-ethylidene-bicyclo [2.2.1] hepta-2-ene and other double bond isomerization processes have been chosen. In addition, short comments are given on side chain alkylation and transesterification reactions. Acid-base bifunctional heterogeneous catalysts are employed for the hydrogenation of aromatic and aliphatic carboxlic acids to the corresponding aldehydes.
   In oxidation processes, the oxidation of an unsaturated alcohol to the corresponding aldehyde will be demonstrated on the BASF-citral-process in which a silver catalyst is applied. For the oxidation of alkylaromatic compounds to the corresponding acids, the oxidation of beta -picoline to nicotic acid in the presence of V2O5/TiO2-catalyst will be discussed. The oxidation of benzene to phenol using N2O as oxidant over a MFI-type zeolite is also described. The dehydrogenation of alpha -limonene to p-cymene over Pd/SiO2 catalyst is selected as an example for the environmentally benign use for a renewable feedstock. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB in the 60s, there was a paradigm shift as a result of the public debate concerning the importance of environmental protection. This finally leads to the concept of sustainable development, or Agenda 21. The threshold of the 21st century is a welcomed occasion to push sustained economic, social and environmentally compatible progress in our world. The environmental technology employed in the steel industry has attained a high standard around the world.
   Sustainable development steel today combines all the components in one integrated strategy. The key to innovations for sustainable steel is research. Continuous improvement of existing technologies and techniques and the development of new processes are the right steps towards higher resource productivity and thus sustainable development steel. This will be shown on the example of Germany.
   Steel is and will remain the no. 1 material with the best price/performance ratio. Steel has an integrated strategy for sustainable development.

AB Adaptive ecosystem management is based on the premise that human understanding of ecosystems is incomplete and biophysical responses to management actions are highly uncertain. Uncertainty is reduced and learning occurs by conducting experiments that provide information about how ecosystems are likely to respond to alternative management actions. Implementation of adaptive ecosystem management is hampered by the lack of an implementation framework. This paper proposes a two-stage hierarchical framework for identifying effective management actions. The first stage uses Bayes rule to identify management actions that have the greatest likelihood of achieving a sustainable ecosystem state. Sustainability is measured by ecological productive capacity. The second stage evaluates the ecologically sustainable ecosystem states identified in the first stage based on their non-ecological attributes. The optimal management action is the one that has the greatest likelihood of achieving an ecologically sustainable state and provides the most preferred combination of non-ecological attributes. The two-stage framework requires a resource manager to identify and measure ecological and non-ecological attributes of ecosystems, specify prior probabilities for ecosystem states, estimate likelihood functions for ecosystem states and weights for non-ecological attributes, and select a procedure for ranking sustainable management actions based on their multiple non-ecological attributes.

AB An indicator for the sustainability of agro-ecosystems, based on the overproduction of entropy, is suggested. In the main research area of the Kiel Ecology Centre energetic input and output parameters characterising agriculture were assessed in 1988 and 1897. It is demonstrated how excess of entropy changes with land management. Different kinds of crops have different values for their overproduction of entropy. It is assumed that these differences are due to a varying, but in many cases an excessive, use of(organic) fertilisers. The characteristics of the crop itself play a minor role. Although the method allows only rough estimations of entropy In agro-ecosystems, it can be stated that, due to a reduction of artificial energy input, sustainability was improved, comparing with the 1988 and 1997 results. Nevertheless, all the examined crop fields are far from reaching a sustainable state from a thermodynamic point of view. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

TI An integrated approach for modelling and managing golf course water
   quality and ecosystem diversity
SO ECOLOGICAL MODELLING
LA English
DT Article
DE ecosystem health; birds; fish; USLE
AB Models can help planners assess the potential impacts of planned land development. However, pollutant yield results from common watershed water quality models are inadequate and must be coupled with other important ecosystem component models to assess the overall impact of land development and management. For example, golf course development typically replaces agricultural or native lands with intensively managed grassland with potential impacts on water quality, as well as avian and aquatic species habitat. An integrated modelling concept was demonstrated using readily available models and data for a hypothetical golf course within the Little Kitten Creek Watershed near Manhattan, KS, USA. A watershed water quality model (EUTROMOD) combined with local fish habitation data and habitat suitability index modelling was used to simulate the overall ecosystem impact of projected golf course design and management actions. Models were calibrated using data for grass and native prairie conditions, and future scenarios were simulated to guide design and management actions. Compared with the native conditions, good golf course management was simulated to increase annual nitrogen (N) yield by 148% and phospohorus (P) yield by 24% with little impact on runoff or erosion, while a poor management scenario increased the N yield by 380%. This change in aquatic nutrient levels along with concurrent projected changes in stream habitat led to a potential impact on three of four fish species analyzed. Avain habitat was also impacted depending upon design and management of non-playing area. An overall design and management plan was developed with the goal of maintaining predevelopment levels of water quality and habitat. Sustainable water quality management must include proper soil and water conservation, irrigation scheduling, and fertilizer and pesticide management. Appropriate features must be designed into numerous contiguous area (1.2 ha minimum for grassland and 0.8 ha minimum for woodland) of non-playing area trough, riparian area, etc.) to meet avian habitat needs. And a diversity of stream habitat conditions must be maintained, including clear pool and gravel-substrate riffle zones, and permanent and intermittent streams. This integrated modelling approach demonstrated the utility of a simplistic framework for analyzing and assessing ecosystem impacts of land development. Further work should integrate and test more complex models and interrelationships between models for lands undergoing a variety of ecosystem changes. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

TI Endogenous institutional innovation and agroindustrialization on the
   Peruvian coast
SO AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
LA English
DT Article
DE agroindustry; Peru; institutions; employment; contracts
AB This paper presents an analysis of endogenous institutional innovations that have recently emerged in the agroindustrial zone of Chincha, on the coast of Peru. These innovations include: (1) contracts between agroindustrial firms and large farmers, introduced by the firms themselves to assure timely delivery and compliance with strict requirements implied by the emerging demanding quality and safety standards fur agro-export of processed asparagus: (2) management services exchanged for labor supervision and land collateral in share tenancy contracts between a management company and "farmer companies" of small cotton farmers. These contractu introduced by the management company illustrate those described theoretically by Eswaran and Kotwal [Am, Econ. Rev. 75 (3), 352-367]. The nature and importance of these institutional changes are twofold: (1) They were induced institutional innovations driven by the requirements of agroindustrialization itself. (2) Together they had ambiguous employment acid income impacts (tending to the negative). On the one hand, the emergence of asparagus and firm-farm contracts reduced employment through exclusion of small farms and shifts to capital-intensive crops. On the other hand, the reinforcement of smallholder cotton and the emergence of farmer companies increased employment and income of smallholders. The institutional innovation allowed them to reduce risk and increase profits and thus access some of the benefits of agroindustrialization and globalization. While processing firm-farm contracts are common in Peru, as is the presence of NGOs bringing subsidized credit, the private management firm innovation is rare and new in Peru and apparently also in the region, and of great interest. In fact policymakers and NGOs have recently discovered that this innovation is taking place and are asking hard questions about whether this innovation can and will he diffused. The interest in the private for-profit institutional change is sharpened by growing doubts about how economically sustainable and widespread a response NGO help can be to small farmer's in maintaining their participation in income-enhancing agroindustrialization. Moreover, with changes in land laws and markers the fluidity of the situation is apparent, with agroindustrial firms even starting to ask themselves whether contracts with large farms are necessary and best.

AB The Sustainable Agriculture Farming Systems (SAFS) Project has studied the transition to low-input and organic alternatives in California's Sacramento Valley. This project compares a 4-5 yr rotation of tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.), safflower (Carthamus tinctorius L.), corn (Zea mays L.), and wheat (Triticum aestivum L,) followed by double-dropped bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L,) in the conventional system and oat (Avena sativa L.)-purple vetch (Vicia benghalensis L.) in the low-input and organic systems. A conventional 2-yr rotation (tomato-wheat) is also studied. In 1997 and 1998, we evaluated the transition to alternative systems on soil bulk density, water holding capacity, infiltration and storage, water use efficiency, and 'Brigade' tomato yield and quality. No differences in laboratory determinations of soil bulk density and water holding capacity were found; however, in situ water holding capacity was highest in the organic system, lowest in the conventional 4-yr rotation and intermediate in the low-input and conventional 2-yr rotations. In 1998, infiltration during 3-h irrigations was 0.028 m(3) m(-1) for the conventional, and 0.062 m(3) m(-1) and 0.065 m(3) m(-1) for the low-input and organic systems, respectively. Similar results were observed in 1997, The alternative systems required more water per irrigation for uniform application, resulting in higher soil water content in the organic systems throughout 1998, Evapotranspiration was higher in the conventional systems in both years relative to other systems. Tomato yields did not differ among systems in either year. Fruit quality was highest in the conventional 4-yr system.

TI Tropical forest biodiversity and The World Heritage Convention
SO AMBIO
LA English
DT Article
AB The World Heritage Convention has been ratified by 158 countries and provides an international legal regime for the conservation of sites of global cultural or natural value. There are 33 tropical forest sites listed under the convention, mainly for their global biodiversity value. They constitute an elite set of biodiversity sites covering approximately 2.5% of the world's closed tropical forests and making a significant contribution to the conservation of the world's terrestrial biodiversity. A range of international initiatives will eventually provide a framework for better conservation and sustainable management of forests worldwide, but the World Heritage Convention provides an existing mechanism which could quickly be mobilized to safeguard the most important forests. In the past sites were selected for listing under the convention if they were perceived to have minimal human impact. However, ail forests are modified by humans and we contend that modification need not be inconsistent with the maintenance of global biodiversity values. The convention could have greater impact if it addressed more directly the reality of the ubiquitous human modification of forests. This could be achieved through use of more adaptive forms of management based on objective criteria and indicators to define tolerance of change and trigger management responses to achieve desired biodiversity outcomes. We conclude that an optimal list of world heritage tropical forest sites might include up to 100 sites or clusters of sires and that such a network of sites could effectively protect a high proportion of the world's forest biodiversity. The present rate of attrition of the world's tropical forests suggests the need for urgent international action to focus on a set of priority sites and the World Heritage Conservation could provide the best international framework for such action.

AB All harvesting of biomass results in a loss of plant nutrients from the soil. The impact of this loss on forest productivity can be determined only if the total amounts of plant nutrients in logs, other biomass and soil are known. in investigations of tropical rainforest ecosystems the total analysis of calcium is common with regard to logs and other biomass, whereas for soils only the content of exchangeable calcium has been determined. This study, involving a calcium-poor bedrock area in Sabah, Malaysia, shows that the contents of total calcium in the soil can be estimated from figures of exchangeable calcium. In the state of Sabah, these estimated amounts were lower in 19 out of 115 soil profiles compared with the amount measured at our research area at Mendolong in Sabah where a sustainable forestry is not possible with the present rotation period without compensating for the harvest-related loss of calcium.

AB Arid lands' imminent water problems are nowadays aggravating. In general, these problems are complex not only due to technical and economic parameters, but also due to policy and institutional framework, human resources development and socio-cultural reasons. The aim of this paper is to reflect the wide variety of water related topics with their inherent complexity and to identify water resources research areas for future. The paper proceeds by reviewing the nature of problems that are emerging in water resources management, and the policy and institutional challenges that have been presented in various forums. It then suggests what water resources strategies and options will be important in research, policy and human resources in order to respond successfully to these challenges. Finally the paper suggests future research needs which will make a difference for various communities and countries around the globe.

AB Dryland cropping regions are present on every continent except Antarctica and represent major small grain producing regions as well as major food grain producing regions. As the human population continues to grow there will be greater demand for food, fiber, and biofuel production. Society is emphasizing the quality of production in addition to the quantity produced. Increased production will be needed at the same time land is being lost to urban encroachment and degradation resulting from wind and water erosion, physical and chemical degradation, and other competing uses (e.g., natural areas). Increased productivity will require efficient capture, storage, and use of precipitation and efficient utilization of all available nutrient resources. Tools for quantifying the spatial variability in soil properties affecting water dynamics, tools for sensing crop stresses that can be alleviated through management, and methods for quantifying the spatial variability in nutrient availability are needed. As efforts are undertaken to increase productivity under dryland conditions, practices that are sustainable and preserve biotic and abiotic natural resources will need to be developed and adopted by producers.

AB The objective of this paper is to investigate the sustainability of the current account deficit in Greece over the 1960-1994 period. The empirical analysis makes use of various unit root and cointegration tests which allow for structural breaks. The results provide evidence in favour of the sustainability of the current account deficit and against a required (and unnecessary) devaluation of the drachma.

AB Sustainable construction faces economic challenges at different levels. On the macroeconomic level, the goals of sustainable construction are being implemented most actively in industrial countries in which the share of construction output is decreasing. However in both less developed and newly industrialized countries, the share of construction output is increasing, but the goals of sustainable construction are more difficult to implement. On the mesoeconomic level, the construction sector depends on the implementation of the goals of sustainable development across the national economy as a whole. Supply chains feeding the construction sector are long and intertwined, making it difficult to assess the effect of different materials, components and procedures. On the microeconomic level, buildings are created with shorter time horizons in response to being a demand-derived commodity and increasingly dominated by mechanical, electrical and electronic equipment. Their finance is being adjusted to the short and medium term which is in conflict with sustainable construction, whose goals rely upon the long term. Two broad approaches for meeting the economic challenges of sustainable construction are considered: governance through standards, legal and regulatory practices; market-oriented policies which influence the costs of particular forms of construction. Both approaches have a role, but it is argued that the market-oriented measures will be more effective at the strategic level.

AB This paper seeks to challenge the traditional way in which we assess the value of green buildings in terms of their environmental friendliness, energy efficiency and whole life cost. In the UK, quantity surveyors (or cost consultants) have a perception that more energy efficient and environmentally friendly buildings cost between 5% and 15% more to build from the outset. This common assumption is not backed up by recent research and should be questioned. Construction professionals need to be informed of the whole life cost and environmental impact of buildings so that they can encourage key stakeholders to make more sustainable choices. These emerging issues together with practical tools are considered with case studies from recent projects.

AB The integrated design process encompasses cross-disciplinary teamwork enabling the improved integration of building, community, natural and economic systems and therefore is a key to sustainable design. The needs for further research, methodologies and validation for the integrated design process are considered by two design practitioners. A workable, replicable model demonstrating the costs and benefits is argued as having an enormous positive impact on the environment and the design and procurement processes. Assessment of some recent initiatives in Canada, Finland and the United States examines progress and identifies further research and practical needs. An agenda for research on integrated design processes is proposed, along with methodologies to codify practice.

Can 'green' buildings affect high-level organizational outcomes, such as profitability, customer satisfaction and innovation? How do the physical attributes of green buildings affect the physiological, psychological, cognitive and social functioning of building occupants at the individual level? This paper explores the wider context of sustainable design, integrating work form organizational effectiveness and human factors to suggest that 'green' buildings provide economic and organizational benefits for business.

AB Operation costs over the life-cycle of a building are a multiple of the initial construction costs. Decisions in the programming stage (briefing) and design process influence life-cycle costs in terms of space, the quantity of structural elements, technical/mechanical service equipment and the choice of materials. The way that the economic and ecological goals are set will influence the efficiency and effectiveness through an appropriate design. To realize the requirements of sustainable building in daily administrative practice, characteristic values for specific building tasks are needed which are determined through the analysis of completed buildings. The resulting target values enable architects and engineers to get a clear and consistent definition of project goals at the programming stage. An interdisciplinary team is needed to manage and guarantee these target values during the whole design process and at the beginning of the utilization phase.

Two case studies of green buildings are discussed with a particular focus on capital cost issues. In the first case study, the extensive use of salvaged building materials and equipment results in a building with low environmental impact. Although added risk exists in using salvaged equipment, it is argued that the benefits far outweigh the challenges as substantial cost savings can be realized. The second case study is used to demonstrate a variety of design techniques which increased the thermal and lighting efficiency of the building, thereby reducing the capital and operating costs of mechanical equipment. The authors conclude that clients are demanding more efficient designs and generally recognize the economic value of sustainable buildings. Design professionals must therefore rise to this challenge and dare to be innovative - it is worth the risk.

AB 'Do environmentally preferable materials cost more?' This paper addresses the question and presents theoretical rationales for both affirmative and negative answers. Clarifications for the terms 'environmentally preferable' and 'cost' are offered in order to explore the question more thoroughly, introducing the ideas of lifecycle costs and societal costs in addition to initial capital cost. The implicit basis for comparison is dissected, revealing implications both for conventional and green products. It is shown that the cost of green materials need not dictate the cost of green buildings, and that knowledgeable designers can utilize green materials, including some that ostensibly cost more, without increasing overall project costs.

AB The nonvascular and vascular plant composition of the early regenerating vegetation present following wildfires and clear-cut logging has been compared separately in three areas of the black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) BSP) - feathermoss (Pleurozium schreberi (Brid.) Mitt.)) forest of western and central Quebec. In each area, a detrended correspondence analysis successfully differentiated the burned and logged stands along the first ordination axis. This separation mainly resulted from the greater abundance of pioneer species or lichens after fire and the greater abundance of residual species after clear-cutting. Spearman's correlation coefficients were calculated to relate variables characterizing physical disturbance of the forest floor and general site conditions to the two first differentiating axes. Variables characterizing forest floor disturbance severity were strongly associated with the first ordination axis in two of the study areas but not in the third one. The interpretation of compositional differences in the light of plant reproductive strategies led to the identification of regeneration patterns that illustrated the influence of disturbance type and severity on post-disturbance vegetation composition. These results suggest that certain forestry practices such as careful logging with the protection of regeneration and soil, scarification, and prescribed burning may differ in their capability to address sustainable forest management issues.

AB The fishery of green abalone in Bahia Asuncion, Baja California Sur (Mexico), was analyzed with an age-structured simulation model using data on catch, effort, abundance estimates, natural mortality and the population growth parameters (k, L-infinity, t(infinity) a and b of the length-weight relationship, age at first capture and longevity). The parent-recruit relationship can be established from the correspondence between the adult stock and the one-year-old juveniles and was analyzed as a random variable with normal distribution; it shows anomalies with a sinusoid pattern. Estimates of potential yield show that current yields are below the biologic maximum sustainable yield and economic maximum sustainable yield levels.

ID CLINICAL-TRIALS; ACUPUNCTURE; MEDICINE; PAIN
AB Objective:To examine factors which sustain complementary therapy services in primary care in order to inform policy making in a context of rapid change. Design: In-depth qualitative case studies, including semi-structured interviews with key informants. Setting: 10 existing schemes of complementary therapy provision in primary care across England. Results: GPs and complementary practitioners reported wide-ranging benefits from complementary therapy provision in primary care. However, they felt that their ability to sustain complementary therapy provision was mediated by a) funding, b) the need For research, and c) appropriate service delivery mechanisms. a) Many schemes were the result of and sustained by personal vision. As such they had negotiated a variety of funding sources over a considerable period, against a background perception that continued funding was uncertain, b) Most informants believed that more research was needed to provide a solid evidence base for service continuation and development, in particular clinical and cost-effectiveness work. c) The manner of service delivery, notably whether a service was located within a general practice or in a referral centre, was seen as having implications for the integration of practitioners and for patient access to services. Conclusions: Current complementary therapy provision in primary care has developed on an 'ad hoc' basis. In particular, the existence of GP fundholding in the 1990s, in which primary care physicians were able to purchase health services on a practice basis, facilitated the development of services in this way. Within the current Primary Care Group context, where purchasing decisions are made collectively by a group of general practices within a region, consideration needs to be given to both the continuity of schemes already in existence and to whether a more standardized approach to service development will be required to facilitate sustainable provision.

AB Tourism is a primary ground for the production of new cultural forms on a global base. In the name of tourism, capital and modernized peoples have been deployed to the most remote regions of the world, farther than any army was ever sent. Institutions have been established to support this deployment, not just hotels, restaurants, and transportation systems, but restorations of ancient shrines, development of local handicrafts for sale to tourists. In short, tourism is not just an aggregate of mere commercial activities; it is also an ideological framing of history, nature, and tradition; a framing that has the power to reshape culture and nature to its own needs.

ID INTEGRATED PEST-MANAGEMENT; AGRICULTURE
AB Integrated pest management (IPM) continues to have different meanings for different people. It is not the intention to define the term in this paper nor to explore the concept in depth, except to note that there appears to be almost constant redefinition and shifting of semantic boundaries whenever it is expedient to do so - often more in response to political fashion than crop pest reality. Rather, the intention is to consider constraints to the implementation of IPM, or to use the analogy of the title "bottlenecks". Recognition of a bottleneck depends very much on different perception, whether of the politician, industrialist, scientist or farmer. In some instances, especially those originating from a pest crisis, different perceptions can converge and radical changes in control practise can come about, especially for indigenous crops. Problems arise if changes in pest control practice are sought in situations where there is no immediate crisis. If there is no convergent perception of the need for IPM then is it even right to raise the question of whether a bottleneck exists? This question becomes more pressing with increased emphasis on agricultural sustainability, "organic" forms of agriculture where IPM may be counter-indicated and, in a different context, the cultivation of introduced and/or novel crops including those genetically modified. In such situations the hegemony of the pest specialist is likely to decline with any shared perception being formed around the crop, the cropping system, and increasingly the surrounding landscape.

AB Insect pests represent a severe limitation for cotton production in many regions of the world. Key pests include several Heliothine moths, which are well adapted to exploit cropping systems associated with cotton and often evolve resistance to pesticides. While many components of IPM have been implemented, the main intervention for the management of key pests continues to be insecticides. This reliance on pesticides brings significant environmental liabilities of off-target drift, chemical residues and resistance. IPM must be founded on a thorough understanding of the ecology of pest and beneficial species and their interaction with the crop. The emerging era of insect resistant transgenic cottons offers real prospects to provide a foundation for more sustainable, economically acceptable IPM with the integration of a range of non-chemical tactics and much less reliance on pesticides.

AB Smallholder vegetable production is expanding rapidly in Zimbabwe both for local sale in urban markets and for export. Pest management practices of 12 small-scale vegetable farmers in two areas of Zimbabwe were surveyed over a five-month period to gather information on crops, pests, diseases and crop protection methods. A range of serious pests and diseases affects non-indigenous vegetables such as Brassicas, tomatoes, onions and cucurbits. Although farmers use some cultural control methods and occasionally botanical pesticides, pest control is predominantly by the use of conventional synthetic pesticides. These are usually applied through lever operated knapsack sprayers although some less orthodox application methods are occasionally used. Results are variable and there are concerns about risks to sprayer operators, consumers and the environment (including natural enemies) due to shortcomings in protective clothing, large deviations from recommended doses and excessive run-off to the soil. Field trials were carried out to evaluate a modified sprayer lance which directs the spray upwards rather than downwards in an attempt to place more of the spray under the leaves where most of the arthropod pests are found. The 'V lance' as it is called improved the uniformity of spray coverage on the upper and lower leaf surfaces and is expected to improve efficacy of spraying and/or offer the opportunity to reduce doses or spray frequencies. Farmers who tested the device reported good results and gave constructive feedback for future improvements. The smallholder vegetable sector requires support in the form of improved access to existing pest management information (in an appropriate form) and focused research targeted at the knowledge gaps which currently impede implementation of sustainable IPM.

AB Improvements in (1) insecticide application, (2) supervised control, and (3) pest forecasting systems have each helped to reduce considerably the amounts of insecticides required to control fly, caterpillar and aphid infestations in vegetable crops in northern Europe. By growing plants that are partially resistant to certain major pests, it is now possible to apply even less insecticide than the dose recommended for the crop. In crops where only small amounts of insecticides are applied, natural predators should prevent large increases in pest insect populations and natural parasitoids should reduce the numbers of pest insects entering subsequent generations. The possible impact of introducing transgenic plants and the use of physical (crop covers), cultural (crop rotation, undersowing) and microbial (e.g. fungi, bacteria and nematodes) methods of control are also discussed. The withdrawal of certain insecticides, as a result of environmental and commercial pressures, means that some crops may soon be without appropriate insecticides for controlling one or more of the major pest species. Whether such systems will be sustainable, remains to be seen. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

DE sustainable crop protection
AB Sustainability is a term which is frequently used - and even abused. Since the Rio Earth Summit, it has been recognised as encompassing three interdependent dimensions: economic impact, social needs and the environment. This paper considers the role of chemical crop protection in sustainable agriculture in Western Europe. It discusses the contribution of industry, both as a provider of products and as a responsible partner for stakeholders, such as farmers, food processors, food retailers and regulatory authorities. A conceptual and factual framework is proposed which reconciles the various elements of sustainable agriculture and chemical crop protection. It concludes that sustainable crop protection is a challenge but is feasible if all players contribute their share. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Adaptation and acceptance of pest control in low-input agriculture will be largely influenced by the approach used to manage soil-borne pests. A single tactic approach, consisting of the routine application of a broad spectrum biocide or biocides to disinfest soil is not compatible with the goal of minimizing inputs and will not have wide-scale applicability in low-input production systems. An integrated pest management (IPM) approach can be compatible with low-input systems but is often difficult to implement due to inherent constraints associated with identifying and treating organisms in the soil. Additionally, IPM will require more intensive knowledge of biological interactions in the soil and the timely management of that information, which may not be practical in low input systems. A pro-active approach, in which the production system is designed to avoid the outbreak of pests, minimizes the use of inputs in crop production by reducing the need for intervention treatments. Traditionally, the impact of soil-borne pests is not considered until after the production system has been designed and implemented. Combining biologically based pest control methods with a production system designed to minimize their impacts offers the most sustainable approach for low-input agriculture.

ID COMMODITY-CHAIN
AB Over the last decade, forests have played an important role in the transition from war to peace in Cambodia. Forest exploitation financed the continuation of war beyond the Cold War and regional dynamics, yet it also stimulated co-operation between conflicting parties. Timber represented a key stake in the rapacious transition from the (benign) socialism of the post-Khmer Rouge period to (exclusionary) capitalism, thereby becoming the most politicized resource of a reconstruction process that has failed to be either as green or as democratic as the international community had hoped. This article explores the social networks and power politics shaping forest exploitation, with the aim of casting light on the politics of transition. It also scrutinizes the unintended consequences of the international community's discourse of democracy, good governance, and sustainable development on forest access rights. The commodification of Cambodian forests is interpreted as a process of transforming nature into money through a political ecology of transition that legitimates an exclusionary form of capitalism.

ID SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC WELFARE; INDEX; AUSTRALIA
AB Existing country studies of the Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare (ISEW), the Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI) and related measures, while sharing the same basic methodological approach, differ with respect to the valuation of important items. This paper provides a critical, but constructive, discussion of the various methods used for the valuation of non-renewable resource depletion and long-term environmental damage, and for the weighting of consumption expenditures for income inequalities. Several recommendations are given on how to improve the methodology for future updates of existing studies or for the construction of new measures.; Sensitivity analysis shows that if these recommendations are followed for the valuation of resource depletion and long-term environmental damage, then the so-called 'threshold' hypothesis, which seems to have gained empirical support from all studies undertaken so far, fails to materialise. This suggests that, as far as factors related to the environment are concerned the widening gap between ISEW and GPI on the one hand and gross national product (GNP) on the other, might be an artefact of highly contestable methodological assumptions.

ID RECRUITMENT
AB Interpreting how populations will change in response to exploitation is essential to the sound management of fish stocks. While deterministic models can be of use in evaluating sustainable fishing rates, the inherent variability of fish populations limits their value. In this paper a probabilistic approach is investigated which avoids having to make strong assumptions about the functional relationship between spawning stock size and the annual number of young fish (recruits) produced. Empirical probability distributions for recruits are derived, conditioned on stock size, and used to indicate likely stock changes under different fishing mortality rates. The method is applied to cod (Gadus morhua) in the North Sea to illustrate how population change can be inferred and used by fishery; managers to choose fishing mortality rates which are likely to achieve sustainable exploitation.

AB During recent years, the public and the scientific communities have signaled concern over growing degradation of ecosystem health, depleted fisheries, pollution, and habitat loss. Public concern has been registered in newspapers, electronic media, and congressional actions. Scientific concern has moved from the pages of journals to the actions of professional societies, as for example the Sustainable Biosphere Initiative of the Ecological Society of America (Lubchenco et al. 1991). Responsive actions at the national and international levels have resulted in Conventions and Protocols on Climate Change, Biodiversity, Ozone, and internationally recognized declarations for sustaining marine fisheries.

AB Ecosystems provide a wide range of services to society. Some forms of use affect the quality of the ecosystem, reducing its value for other users. This leads to a conflict of interest that is often settled through political processes, resulting in some form of regulation. We link theory on ecosystem response to theories from the socioeconomic branches of science to analyze the mechanisms behind two widespread problems associated with such political solutions. First, they often represent a compromise rather than an integrative solution. We demonstrate that, particularly in sensitive ecosystems, integrative solutions yield a higher average social utility and imply a higher ecosystem quality. Integrative solutions require insight into ecosystems responses to different forms of use and a complete overview of ecosystem services to society. Second, there is a systematic bias away from optimal shared use toward activities that are detrimental to ecosystem quality. This bias arises from the fact that utilities depending on ecosystem quality are often shared by large diffuse groups, whereas pollution and harvesting activities can usually be traced to relatively small and well-organized groups. Theory and data indicate that this type of concentrated group is systematically better at mustering political power than large groups, which find it difficult to realize collective action due to what is known in game theory as "free-rider problems. Our analysis suggests that the following three key ingredients are needed to correct the problems of bias and compromise: (a) clear insight into ecosystem dynamic responses to human use, (b) a broad inventory of credible measurements of ecosystem utilities, (c) avoidance of bias due to differences in the organizational power of groups of stakeholders. We argue that good ecosystem models, institutionalized ecosystem valuation, and innovative tax-setting schedules are essential to achieving a socially fair and sustainable use of ecosystems by societies. In addition, we highlight the fact that many environmental problems remain unresolved for a long time and briefly identify the social mechanisms responsible for this delay.

TI Harnessing carbon markets for tropical forest conservation: towards a
   more realistic assessment
SO ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION

ID MITIGATION; MECHANISM; SECTOR
AB The proposed Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) of the Kyoto Protocol paves the way for financial and technological transfers to support forestry projects that sequester carbon or protect carbon stocks. From its inception, the concept has been highly controversial. It has been enthusiastically supported by those who believe that conservation of tropical forests will be difficult unless forest owners and managers are compensated for the environmental services of their forests. Others believe that financial transfers supporting 'carbon farming' would ignore social concerns and the full range of goods and services of forests. This paper examines the implications of CDM for forest conservation and sustainable use, by drawing on recent literature and the results of a policy dialogue with CDM stakeholders. We conclude that initial estimates of the contribution tropical forestry could make to both climate change mitigation and to forest conservation need to be scaled down. CDM payments for tropical forestry are likely to be received in a far more limited area than initially expected. The cost-effectiveness of forestry projects relative to projects in the energy sector may have been overestimated. In particular few estimates have adequately accounted for the likelihood that the duration of CDM forestry projects is unlikely to be as long as the residency time of carbon in the atmosphere. Also political realities and investor priorities may not have been sufficiently understood. CDM funding for forestry may also decline in future as economically viable clean technologies are increasingly developed in the energy sector. Tropical forests are likely to be an intermediate climate change mitigation strategy for buying time, until more permanent options become available. The most important justification for including forests in CDM may lie in the contribution CDM could potentially make to forest conservation and sustainable use. An analysis of the implications of CDM for forests reveals the importance of involving forest stakeholders more closely in the CDM debate. To prevent perverse outcomes and reduce the risk of 'leakage' of emission reduction to areas outside project boundaries; CDM projects may need to be limited to niches which meet certain political and institutional preconditions and where sufficient understanding of local decision-making and the broader context is available. CDM may be more effective if used to remove non-economic impediments to forestry activities that are economically viable and meet local needs. Lessons from the forestry sector in relation to plantations, natural forest management, forest conservation and non-timber forest products are discussed to illustrate the dangers of misusing CDM and also to give examples of how CDM could be harnessed for better use of forests. CDM should be seen as one more tool for enhancing the effectiveness of more conventional ways of promoting forest conservation and sustainable use.

AB The Itapiranga Sustainable Logging Plan provides an example of how Brazil's licensing system functions for logging companies in the state of Amazonas. Two questions need to be dealt with: "How sustainable can logging in the Amazon be?" and "What and how effective are existing legal mechanisms to deal with logging projects?" The environmental impact assessment (EIA) and environmental impact statement (EIS, known as the RIMA in Brazil), present relatively detailed accounts of biodiversity and the need to adopt conservation strategies to protect it. However, social and health impacts are only superficially addressed. The economic sustainability of the operation over multiple cycles is not demonstrated. The multidisciplinary teams responsible for the EIA and EIS (RIMA) reports are hired by the project proponent, an arrangement inherently carrying the risk of biasing the result. Logging reduces biodiversity, releases greenhouse gases and inflicts social and health costs. These impacts reduce the ability of Amazonian forests to provide environmental services and to supply food and livelihood security to local populations. The reports inflate positive effects such as employment: the estimated number of jobs was cut by more than half in a revision made after the EIA and EIS (RIMA) had been approved. Not only do the reports need to be more realistic in assessing both positive and negative consequences of proposed projects, but better means are needed to ensure that promised mitigatory measures are enforced in practice. Many of the lessons that can be drawn from the Itapiranga Plan are not unique to logging projects and apply to licensing of development activities generally in Brazil and elsewhere.

AB Costa Rica has recently established a program that provides funds for reforestation and forest protection on private lands, partly through the sale of carbon certificates to industrialized countries. Countries purchasing these carbon offsets hope one day to receive credit against their own commitments to limit emissions of greenhouse gases. Costa Pica has used the proceeds of the sale of carbon offsets to Norway to help finance this forest incentive program. called the Private Forestry Project, which pays thousands of participants to reforest or protect forest on their lands. The Private Forestry Project is accompanied by a monitoring program conducted by Costa Rican forest engineers that seeks to determine net carbon storage accomplished on these lands each year. The Private Forestry Project, which is officially registered as an Activity implemented jointly. is a possible model for bundled projects funded by the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) established by the 1997 Kyoto Protocol to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. It also serves as an interesting example for the CDM because it was designed by a developing country host--not by an industrialized country investor. Accordingly, it reflects the particular "sustainable development" objectives of the host country or at least the host planners. Early experience in implementing the Private Forestry Project is evaluated in light of the main objectives of the CDM and its precursor-Activities Implemented Jointly it is concluded that the project appears to meet the criteria of global cost-effectiveness and financing from non-ODA sources. The sustainable development implications of the project are specific to the region and would not necessarily match the ideals of all investing and developing countries. The project may be seen to achieve additional greenhouse gas abatement when compared against some (although not all) baselines.

AB This study was undertaken to (1) determine the suitability of ecosystems within Mount Spil National Park (Turkey) to human activities by a systematic zoning procedure, and (2) provide the basis for developing sound management strategies based on natural-cultural resource attributes of the park. After assessing natural-cultural resources and human activity requirements, the suitability of three zones (Strict Protection Zone. SPZ; Restricted Use Zone. RUZ; and Recreation and Administration Zone, RAZ) for proposed human activities/land uses was determined in order to maintain ecological sustainability and integrity through a weighting-ranking methodology, based on a grid cell resolution of 1 km x 1 km. Results showed that out of the three management zones, the RUZ in which the recreational activities that do not require physical developments are allowed constituted 82% of the park area as the first priority management zone. The proposed zoning procedure is believed to be a key step to improve management for both the study area and other national parks with the similar landscape features.

AB Management for the future sustainability and integrity of our nation's ecological resources requires concepts and tools for measuring status and trends in these resources at multiple spatial and temporal scales and at multiple levels of biological organization. Key elements of this process are ecologically meaningful indicators and cost-effective monitoring designs. The Environ mental Monitoring and Assessment Program (EMAP) advances the science needed for measuring ecosystem condition and trends. Most recently the EMAP approach has been successfully used by participants in the Mid-Atlantic Integrated Assessment (MAIA), including EPA's Office of Research and Development, EPA's Region III, and the States of the Mid-Atlantic. The participants in MAIA have produced a regional landscape atlas, state of the estuaries report, and state of the streams report. The work in MAIA is currently moving from monitoring into the assessment phase. The Western EMAP Pilot (Western Pilot), will be a test of our current MAIA indicators and technology for applicability in western ecosystems. New indicators and designs may be needed in the Western Pilot for assessments at the level of EPA's Regions, of the states, and of the Tribes; these assessments will be done so that they can be combined to provide regional assessments. Our coastal monitoring program in the Western estuaries will also be initiated shortly. Subsequently, this will be expanded to the Gulf and Atlantic coasts to provide the current condition of our national estuaries. By continuing to improve the science of monitoring, EMAP researchers will remove data gaps and allow the unequivocal assessment of the health of the nation's resources.

TI Conversion of a flood control system to a sustainable system: The energy
   requirements for pipeline transport of silt
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB The reservoirs of flood control systems will eventually fill with sediment, and all flood control will be lost. Well before complete filling, the loss of flood control and competition with other system purposes, such as power generation, will force remediation efforts. The energy required to transport the sediments from the reservoirs back to the river channel has been determined using the Pick-Sloan system of the Missouri River as a representative system. Pipeline transport of the silt and clay requires about 3% of the hydroelectric energy generated by the system. This is small enough to justify a thorough study of the full cost and environmental impact of conversion to a sustainable system. Sand and gravel are more economically moved by rail, but they are probably best used as underlayment for silt and clay to mimic the natural process of fertile flood plain creation. The time frame for remediation is much shorter than often presumed. Using the volume of the permanent pool (25%) as the loss of reservoir capacity allowable before sustainability is achieved, the two lowest of the six Pick-Sloan reservoirs will have filled their permanent pools in less than 25 yr.

AB Safe drinking water is essential for human health and sustainable development. In the last 30 years, the International Development Research Centre (IDRC) has funded over 200 applied research projects on tools and strategies for improving water and sanitation conditions in poor populations around the world. Realizing that the safety of drinking water is just as dependent on being toxicant free as on being pathogen free, the IDRC initiated WaterTox, a novel international research network with scientific institutions from Argentina, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, India, Mexico, and the Ukraine. The objectives of WaterTox were to develop and validate a battery of simple, inexpensive and practical bioassays for toxicity testing of water samples, to identify and validate appropriate sample concentration alternatives that would allow the battery of bioassays to assess the potential toxicity of waters used for human consumption, and to design, in collaboration with network partners, a strategy to promote the adoption of this battery for toxicity testing at the international level. The bioassays selected for WaterTox were based on the premise that they should be able to be performed in-country without the need for expensive imported supplies. A description of the procedures to establish the WaterTox project, the laboratories involved, the problems encountered, and results obtained are presented in this overview report.

AB A large component of uncertainty in ecological risk assessment (ERA) arises from the disparity between the time scale of toxicity measurements and the time scale of predictions of ERA models. It is difficult to make predictions about the persistence of populations from data from short-term toxicity tests. Reproductive toxicity tests provide data about how population growth rate (r) is reduced with toxicant exposure. Although reduction in r is believed to be one of the most important effects of toxicant exposure, its ecological significance has been difficult to quantify. For rotifers, r is typically reduced by 10 to 15% at no-observed-effect concentrations (NOEC). We investigated r reductions of 0 to 30% in time series models of the dynamics of natural rotifer populations to predict probability of quasiextinction. Computer simulations showed that small reductions in r can have large effects over long time periods. This means that purportedly safe toxicant concentrations like those at NOEC levels can reduce r so that population extinction becomes much more likely. Reductions in r greater than about 30% destine rotifer populations near certain extinction within 100 years. Simulations indicate that an r reduction of 5% (EC5) approximately doubles the probability of extinction and is probably the maximum tolerable for the long-term persistence of rotifer populations. When episodic catastrophic population reductions are coupled with r reduction, probabilities of extinction are increased substantially. Several models yielded similar results, so the conclusions do not seem strongly dependent on the form of the model. Incorporating population viability analysis into ecological risk assessments could improve our ability to define conditions required for the long-term sustainability of populations.

AB At the dawn of a new millennium, Geology will surely play an increasingly important role in our better understanding of the Earth, in our path towards a sustainable society. With broader application of information technology and modeling of the geological processes, Geology is becoming more and more quantitative, and better prepared to give its contribution to Earth management. This is a very complex task, since all processes on the Earth are interlinked, and hence the approach must be interdisciplinary, when the participation of geoscience professionals from different fields is essential.

AB Current analyses of issues relating to ethnicity and empowerment are silent about the significance of the environment in shaping and being shaped by human relations. For its part, environmental policy research, with few exceptions, has also ignored the dynamics of identity construction and cultural values that inform human relationships with the environment and thus affect environmental sustainability. I address this gap in the scholarship through an analysis of the Sardar Sarovar Project [SSP] in India. I explore the interweaving of the constructions of gender, ethnicity and empowerment and their implications for a new politics of the environment - the politics of environmental justice. I argue that discourses of modernization underpin the arguments of all those who discuss the SSP, whether in favour or against.

   ANOMALIES
AB Analyses of atmospheric observations in the North Pacific demonstrate extensive decadal-scale variations in the mid-latitude winter surface wind stress. In the decade after 1976 winter, eastward wind stress doubled over a broad area in the central North Pacific and the winter zero wind stress curl line was displaced about 6 degrees southward. This resulted in increased southward Ekman transport, increased oceanic upwelling, and increased turbulent mixing as well as a southward expansion of the area of surface divergence. All these factors contributed to a decadal winter cold anomaly along the subtropical side of the North Pacific Current. In summer the cold anomaly extended eastward, almost reaching the coast of Oregon. The increased gradient in wind stress curl and southward displacement of the zero curl line also resulted in an increase in total North Pacific Current transport, primarily on the Equator side of this Current. Thus, surface water entering the California Current was of more subtropical origin in the post-1976 decade. Southward (upwelling favourable) wind stress and sea surface temperature (SST) in the area off San Francisco exhibit at least three different types of decadal departures from mean conditions. In association with the 1976 climatic shift, marine fishery production in the Oyashio, California and Alaska Currents altered dramatically, suggesting that these natural environmental variations significantly alter the long-term yields of major North Pacific fisheries.

AB Biological information collected during a 4-year experimental trap-fishery for Palinurus delagoae off South Africa was used to estimate growth rates, size at sexual maturity, and natural mortality. These parameters, together with an estimate of total mortality and catch-at-length information from the trap-fishery and a crustacean trawl fishery in the same region, were used in a deterministic length-based cohort analysis to estimate fishing mortality and recruitment, and to assess the impact of the two fisheries on the resource. The impact of both trap and trawl fisheries is greatest on immature and small mature lobsters (60 mm<CL<69 mm). Over-fishing on this component of the population (by traps and trawls) and on the adult component (by traps) have led to a rapid decrease in catches (down from 89.5 to 7.4 t per year for traps, and from similar to 33 to 10 t per year for trawls) and in catch rates, between 1994 and 1997. A length-based Thompson and Bell model suggests that a combined catch of similar to 60 t per year may have been sustainable at the average effort level exerted over the 4-year study period, and that the spawning biomass would then have been reduced to similar to 29% of pristine. Given the small predicted yield from this resource and the high mortality of small lobsters, fisheries managers opted for a single fishery. The trawl fishery was selected, based on higher annual earnings, a lower economic risk, and an established infrastructure in the region. An ecologically beneficial spinoff from selecting the trawl fishery is that rocky areas are inaccessible to trawl nets, resulting in natural refuges for lobsters against fishing.

ID FORESTS; PRIORITIES
AB Natural resource managers, environmental interest groups, and public agencies need identifiable, measurable indicators of sustainability based on meaningful fine-scale specifics that are appropriate for both fine and increasingly broader social/ecological scales. The "Identify the Specifics" framework, field tested in Ontario, Saskatchewan, and British Columbia, uses collective local expert knowledge to integrate and prioritize social/ecological concerns that become the foundation for both local and increasingly broader-scale indicators of sustainable management. Results to date suggest that: (1)local experts have valuable knowledge to contribute; (2) identified local indicators, once reviewed, can contribute to bath local- and broader-scale indicators; (3) fewer than 10 indicators may provide an adequate foundation for assessing the sustainability of local range and forest management practices; and (4) local and broader-scale experts commonly identify different indicators because they have different knowledge bases, priorities, and responsibilities. Differences in the indicators identified among experts representing different scales may be minimized if indicators at broader scales are developed with knowledge of specifics from finer scales. The Specifics approach is presently being used across British Columbia to help identify knowledge gaps and related research and extension priorities.

AB With a current yearly output of $241 million per year nontimber forest products (NTFP) contribute significantly to the welfare of rural and First Nations communities in Canada. Maple sap products, wild mushrooms and wild fruits are the most important NTFP for consumption both in Canada and abroad. However, because of increased access to international markets by entrepreneurs along with a growing international demand for NTFP it may be possible to double or triple Canada's harvest of NTFP. Further development of this industry should be associated with adequate training of harvesters in terms of NTFP biology in order to maximize profits while achieving biological sustainability. As well, research should emphasize the domestication of specific NTFP to meet growing demand, increase revenues and promote biodiversity conservation.

AB Sustaining forest productivity requires maintaining soil productivity and prompt establishment of adequate regeneration following harvest. We determined effects of commercial, winter-logging of aspen-dominated stands on soil disturbance and development of regeneration on three sites with clay soils. We established transects across each site, recorded pre-harvest stand information, post-harvest site disturbance, and first-year aspen sucker density and height. Use of large logging equipment produced heavy disturbance on 38% of a well-drained site; 45% of the area had no aspen suckers and 82% had less than the recommended minimum of 15 000 (15 k) suckers per ha (6 k ac(-1)). Mean height of dominant suckers was 45 cm (18 in). Hand felling and a small skidder caused heavy disturbance on 12% of a moderately well-drained site. Sucker density averaged 34 k ha(-1) (14 k ac(-1)) and height was 97 cm (38 in). Cut-to-length (CTL) equipment produced heavy disturbance on 11% of a somewhat poorly-drained site, mean sucker density of 24 k ha(-1) (9.6 k ac(-1)), and height of 101 cm (40 in). These severely disturbed areas essentially are removed from the aspen-producing land base. Retaining the northern hardwood and conifer growing stock would result in less site disturbance and help maintain natural hydrologic and nutrient cycling processes.

TI Process thinking - a new paradigm for science and engineering
SO FUTURES
LA English
DT Article
AB As our research related to sustainability has progressed, we have realized that knowledge is not the prime problem. We believe that the ruling paradigm of science, engineering and policy needs to be critically evaluated. This paradigm holds that everything can be reduced to the tiniest particles which interact in a clockwork-like fashion. However, new discoveries have lead to the concept of 'systems thinking'. Systems thinking is particularly important in dealing with our environmental problems and other large-scale open-ended problems. But is systems thinking sufficient? We intend to show that systems thinking is a major step in the right direction, but it is insufficient in handling the increasing environmental problems of our planet, We believe that 'process thinking' is a better paradigm due to the profound importance of change and continuous improvement, The superficial understanding of change in science and engineering has, in our opinion, resulted in what we call the 'Dogmas of Science and Engineering' which are the main roots of our problems. A new paradigm must therefore violate these dogmas for mankind to overcome the problems we are facing. This new paradigm must permeate the whole of society as well, and hence both scientific and political leadership is crucial. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Medicine and health are often confused in both the public mind and in the professional literature. While medical approaches depend on hierarchical lines of authority, normal science, diagnoses and authoritative treatment, the promotion of health requires a holarchic, post-normal, democratic, activist science. Almost all public health initiatives involve tensions across scales, wherein individuals must necessarily forgo individual freedoms in order to achieve public good. In the same way, sustainable health will require the acknowledgement, maintenance, and constant re-negotiation of tensions across ecological and social perspectives. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB This study estimates the relative contributions of environment and farm management strategies in influencing soil faunal assemblages and attempts tl, identify the species with potential to affect sustainability of intensive grazing management systems in the north-eastern USA. it arises because of the change from confinement feeding of daily cattle, consequent upon concerns about negative environmental effects, the rising costs for machinery and housing, and reduced profit margins, together with the absence of data from which the consequences of such change on thc soil fauna may be predicted.
   Macro-invertebrates we-re sampled in soil from seventy-eight grazed pastures on twenty-one dairy farms in Pennsylvania, USA, in the spring of 1994. On five of these farms, macro-invertebrates were sampled (four pastures per farm) in the spring, summer and autumn seasons of 1994, 1995 and 1996. In 1997, macroinvertebrates were Sampled in sail during spring, summer and autumn from (four pastures per farm) on three farms in New York, and during spring and summer on three farms in Vermont. Species richness ranged from two to twelve species (mean 6.4) per pasture site in Pennsylvania and Ave to eighteen species (mean 10.7) in New York and Vermont. The communities were dominated at most sites by earthworms. Earthworms were correlated with soil basal and substrate-induced respiration/carbon ratio, and soil moisture, bur were negatively correlated with cows per hectare and herbage biomass in Pennsylvania. Sitona larvae were recorded at nineteen of the twenty-one farms during the spring of 1994 across Pennsylvania and occurred at populations >5 m(-2) in 68% of the sampled pastures. Sitona larvae were less abundant in New York and Vermont. Elaterid larvae comprised a complex of seven species of which Aeolus melillus (Say) and Melanotus communis (Gyllenhal) comprised 35% and 39%, respectively, of the elaterids collected in Pennsylvania. Agriotes mancus (Say) and Ctenicera destructor (Brown) comprised 41% and 26%, respectively, of four species collected in New York and Vermont. Scarabaeid larvae, comprising a complex of fight species, were detected at only 27% of the seventy-eight pastures sampled in spring 1994 in Pennsylvania. Five species were collected in ten of the twelve New York pastures and lour species in nine of the twelve Vermont pastures. Populations of scarabaeid larvae averaged <25 m(-2) in all three states, except in three Pennsylvania pastures in spring 1994. Detrended canonical correspondence analysis (DCCA) showed pasture standing biomass, legume diversity, pre-winter stubble height, white clover pasture content, and soil phosphorus levels influenced numbers of invertebrate species more than climatic factors, such as temperature, rainfall, altitude, latitude and seasonal water table. DCCA also showed most pastures to be close to the average of environmental factors. The extremely low density of herbivorous macro-invertebrates in soil and the absence of pest outbreaks may indicate a stable soil ecosystem.

ID ARID REGIONS; RECHARGE
AB We evaluated the use of the renewable ground water resources of the Eastern Desert to develop sustainable agriculture in Upper Egypt, an alternative that could alleviate some of Egypt's dependence on water from the Nile River, Ground water from shallow aquifers in the Eastern Desert of Egypt, near the intersection of Wadi El-Tarfa and the Nile River, was analyzed for chemical compositions, stable isotope ratios, and tritium activities. The ground water has a range in total dissolved solids of 300 to 5000 mg/L, Values of delta D and delta(18)O range from -10 to +34 parts per thousand and -2 to +5.2 parts per thousand, respectively, and defines a line having a slope of 5.7 that intersects the meteoric water line at about delta D = -15 parts per thousand on a plot of delta D versus delta(18)O. These findings indicate that the water might have been derived by a combination of evaporation of and salt addition to regional precipitation. Only one sample could have been derived directly by evaporation and transpiration of modern Nile River mater. Salinization of the ground water could have occurred through dissolution of marine aerosol dry fallout, carbonate minerals, gypsum, and other trace evaporitic minerals at and near the ground surface. Tritium activities ranged from 0.04 to 12.9 TU (tritium units), indicating that all but one of the samples were derived at least partly from precipitation that occurred within the last 45 years. These data indicate that Nubian Aquifer paleowater is not a significant component of the shallow aquifers of this portion of the Eastern Desert. The most likely source of this ground water is sporadic flash flood events yielding locally voluminous recharge that accumulates in coarse sediments and fractured rock beneath alluvial channels. The magnitude of this renewable ground water resource and its potential for supporting sustainable agriculture require further investigation.

TI The practice of cost recovery in urban low-income housing: a discourse

ID DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; SERVICES
AB The paper is an attempt to revisit the practice of cost recovery in the context of urban low-income housing. The discourse begins by outlining the arguments for cost recovery in low-income housing projects. The discussion acknowledges that the principle of cost recovery is central to the establishment of replicable housing projects and sustainable housing finance systems. The paper then explores the salient issues in the principle of cost recovery. These are explored from the standpoint of the financier and the borrower. It is pointed out that the financier has obligations and responsibilities to depositors and shareholders. The paper then argues that awareness of obligations and responsibilities should be accompanied by practices and procedures that institutionalise and promote cost recovery. Regarding the borrowers the paper highlights the importance of their circumstances within the broader macro-economic sphere. It is then argued that the mode of cost recovery as reflected in the terms of repayment should as much as possible suit the situation and requirements of both the borrower and the lender. The discussion then introduces the role of "outsiders" in cost recovery and how politicians and busybodies can frustrate the efforts of the financier to recover funds invested in housing. The implications of cost recovery are then drawn out. In this case replicability and investor confidence are emphasised. The results of obsessions with cost recovery are also outlined. These points are then illustrated by examples from urban low-income housing in Zimbabwe. The study concludes by cautioning that the critical issues involved in cost recovery are not exclusively financial, technical and managerial. Most of the crucial issues relate institutional practices and procedures in the face of a multiplicity of direct and indirect stakeholders involved. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

TI Cutting costs without drawing blood
SO HARVARD BUSINESS REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
AB When looking for ways to cut costs, most managers reach for the head-count hatchet, and the markets usually roar with approval. But a company can almost always create far more sustainable value by rigorously evaluating the small-ticket capital items that often get rubber-stamped. Drawing on his experience as a consultant and providing numerous anecdotes, the author contends that those "little" requests often prove to be gold plated or unnecessary.
   A disciplined evaluation involves asking only eight questions and conducting postmortems - regular audits of units' capital spending. But the payoff is enormous. Because cutting the capital budget increases cash flow, the author argues that a permanent cut of just 15% in the planned level of capital spending could boost some companies' market capitalization by as much as 30%.
   The first three questions - Is this your investment to make? Does it realty have to be new! How are our competitors meeting compliance needs? - are asked of operating managers as they assemble capital project requests. The next three are asked by senior managers of themselves and their colleagues as they examine proposals: Is the left hand duplicating investments made by the right! Are trade-offs between profit and capital spending well understood? Are there signs of budget massage? At the end of the review process, senior managers ask: Are we fully using shared assets! How fine-grained are our capacity measures? The author's suggestions for the postmortem include searching for systematic problems with whole classes of expenditures and making sure audit teams come up with specific recommendations for change.

TI Science in practice: can health care reform projects in central and
   eastern Europe be evaluated systematically?
SO HEALTH POLICY
LA English
DT Article
DE health care reforms; evaluation; project implementation; central and
   eastern Europe
AB Since the beginning of the 1990s, health care reform projects have taken place in many of the former Communist countries, but these projects are rarely evaluated systematically. Evaluation, however, is an important tool for increasing their rationality and continuity. The aim of this paper is to identify the difficulties in the efforts towards systematic evaluation and draw lessons for the future. For this aim, the requirements for a more rigorous, controlled evaluation are compared with our experiences of evaluating a health care reform project in the Slovak republic. From this comparison a number of discrepancies arise: it was difficult to set clear and realistic goals at the start of the project; the outcomes of the project could not always be measured, nor could 'the process' always be distinguished from the outcomes. Systematic evaluation was further hampered by an insufficient degree of structuration of the project, in advance and during the implementation, and by the absence of a tradition and infrastructure for data collection. On the basis of the experiences and relevant literature, recommendations for future evaluations are formulated. The main lesson is that, given the context, often it will not be possible to use an ambitious evaluation design, and concessions need to be made. At the same time, continuous efforts towards more systematic evaluation procedures should be made, but it is wise and more sustainable to do this in an incremental way.

TI Financing blood transfusion services in sub-Saharan Africa: a role for
   user fees?
SO HEALTH POLICY AND PLANNING
LA English
DT Article
ID DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; HIV-INFECTION; DONORS; RISK
AB The provision of a secure and safe blood supply has taken on new importance in sub-Saharan Africa with the onset of the AIDS epidemic. Blood transfusion services capable of providing safe blood are not cheap, however, and there has been some debate on the desirability and sustainability of different financing mechanisms for blood transfusion services. This paper examines patterns of financing blood transfusion in three countries - Cote d'lvoire, Zimbabwe and Mozambique. It goes on to consider the conceptual options for financing safe blood, and to examine in detail the possible role of user fees for blood transfusion in Africa, developing a simple model of their likely burden to patients based on data from Cote d'lvoire.
   The model indicates that, at best, there can only be a limited role for user fees in the financing of safe blood transfusion services, due mainly to the relatively high cost of producing a unit of safe blood. Charging individuals for the blood they receive is likely to be administratively complex and costly, could realistically recover only a fraction of the production costs involved, and is further complicated by the fact that the main recipients of blood transfusion in sub-Saharan Africa are children and pregnant women. If cost-recovery for safe blood is to be attempted, the most viable option appears to be that of charging a collective fee, levied upon all inpatients, not just on those who receive blood. Such a mechanism is not without problems, not least in its failure to offer incentives for more appropriate blood use, and it is still likely to recover only a portion of the costs of producing safe blood. Whether or not cost-recovery is instituted, there will remain an important role for public funding of blood transfusion services, and, by implication, an important role for foreign donor support.

TI Health promotion development in Australia and New Zealand
SO HEALTH PROMOTION INTERNATIONAL

ID PROGRAMS
AB This paper describes and analyses the development of health promotion in Australia and New Zealand. It argues that health promotion has become an established approach to addressing public health problems in both nations over the past two decades. The paper documents the mixed progress both countries have made in improving the health of their populations and the challenges that remain for health promotion. The paper describes the health promotion infrastructure, investment in health promotion and collaboration that has occurred. It also describes innovations in structure and practice that have been implemented. The paper argues that while there has been considerable infrastructure development over the East decade there are still weaknesses in areas eg. workforce development and research and evaluation. While government has been the major investor in health promotion, investment has remained relatively small, in part because decision-makers have failed to be convinced of its value. Collaboration with the public, within the health sector and with other sectors has been a strength of health promotion activity in both nations. Overall, much has been learnt over the past two decades on which to build. Key features of health promotion include increasing use of intersectoral action, the use of public policy and the mass media as health promotion strategies, and the increasing control Maori have taken over the purchase and provision of health promotion services in New Zealand. Both countries still have significant weaknesses to address,e.g. increasing our focus on the determinants of health, implementing sustainable programs and appropriately engaging the personal health sector in health promotion. Above all, the next decade of development will require increasing emphasis on effective action to reduce inequalities in health, particularly between indigenous and non-indigenous people.

TI House prices and accessibility: The testing of relationships within the
   Belfast Urban Area
SO HOUSING STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
ID DETERMINANTS
AB The debate surrounding the sustainability of urban areas and the need to reduce dependency upon the car as the primary mode of transportation has rekindled interest in the relationship between accessibility, price and location of owner occupied housing. Traditionally, attempts at quantification have used hedonic analysis employing straight-line distance measurements to focal points such as the CBD as an indicator of accessibility. This paper focuses upon factors affecting the price structure of residential property in the Belfast Urban Area, examining the relative influence of property characteristics, socio-economic factors and the impact of accessibility. The model employs an accessibility index computed for each of 182 traffic zones and uses transaction data for a sample of 2648 residential properties sold during 1996. Results indicate that accessibility is of little significance in explaining variation in house prices at a city-wide scale but at a sub-market level, particularly in lower-income areas, accessibility can be an important influence. The analysis highlights the importance of investigation at a sub-market level and draws conclusions regarding the complexity of relationships within an urban area.

AB Modeling of soil systems is an essential approach to discussions of the historical dimensions of soil sustainability, but as yet there has been no formal testing and application of such models. In this paper we first test the ability of the CENTURY agroecosystem model to predict soil organic carbon levels in anthropogenic plaggen soils from ethnographic and historical land management information of manuring practices on the Shetland island of Papa Stour. Observations suggest that the model makes accurate predictions and can be used to develop and test hypothetical land management scenarios. Results suggest that within historic time the arable areas of Papa Stour were manured at a level above that required to maintain soil organic carbon levels, and consequently the hill-land source of organic material was overexploited with no real apparent gain. Modeled evidence suggests that short-term observations of soil organic carbon levels would indicate a greater degree of manure application than was actually required over the longer term. Successful rise of the CENTURY model in this historic context suggests that it may be applicable to questions of soil sustainability in other areas of the North Atlantic region.

AB This paper focuses on the present and future state of the electric power sector, future development of European power systems interconnections and power exchanges, cooperation, and direction of reforming the industry. It discusses the deregulation process and experience in Scandinavia, electricity infrastructure in Hungary, challenges to the German electricity system as part of the western European interconnected system of the Union for the Coordination of Protection and Transmission of Energy (UCPTE), extension of European interconnections to the Black Sea and central African countries, together with the development of a Trans-European synchronized power system as seen from the East. It also examines the current situation and policy of Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and Moldova taking into account the recently created New Independent States (NIS). It is based on presentations that were made on European Policy on Electricity Infrastructure, Interconnections and Electricity Exchanges at the IEEE PES 1997 Summer Meeting in Berlin (and subsequently updated).
   First, development of a Trans-European synchronized interconnected power system as seen from the East is reviewed. Examined is the UCPTE system of Western Europe which interconnects synchronously 15 states and the IPS system of Eastern Europe uniting in parallel operation power systems of 11 states. Then, policy on electricity infrastructure, interconnections and electricity exchanges is discussed, taking into account the European Commission Directive on Internal Electricity Market development and a planned step-by-step process of national market opening; where the New Energy Law, the Office of Energy Regulation, and European interconnections with CENTREL (comprised of grid networks in Poland, Slovakia, Czech Republic, and Hungary) and UCPTE interconnection is reviewed. Deregulation processes in Europe and recent experience from Scandinavia is discussed as is electricity infrastructure in Hungary where ownership and organizational structure of the companies of the Hungarian power system have been constantly changing since 1992. Electricity infrastructure and electric policy of CIS in European energy space is then reviewed. Finally, extension of European cooperation to the Black Sea and Central Asian countries where: i) technological aspects of interconnections and ii) extension of European interconnection is examined. It is shown that interconnection of Black Sea Economic Cooperation (BSEC) and Central Asian countries provides important advantages by contributing to sustainable energy development.

AB A field experiment was carried out during both rainy and winter seasons from 1993 to 1997, to find out the effect of integrated nutrient supply on crop productivity, system sustainability, soil fertility and weed dynamics in rice (Oryza sativa L.)-rice system of coastal Andhra Pradesh. The rice-rice system required application of 100% recommended fertilizers in both rainy and winter seasons to double the systems productivity than the control. It was possible to reduce N fertilizer need by 25% through the application of organics along with chemical N to the rainy-season rice. Highest carbohydrate (84.9 q/ha), protein (7.72 q/ha) and bran oil (132 kg/ha) yield of the system was obtained when 50% N was substituted through Sesbania green-leaf manure. The organic carbon status of soil enhanced in all organic added treatments than initial level. Substantial build up of P was noticed in compost and Sesbania green leaf-applied plots. Regarding available K, decreasing trend was noticed under all the treatments except straw-incorporated plots. Weed dynamics indicated that compost-treated plots and inorganic N fertilized treatments were heavily infested with Echinochloa colona weed, whereas straw and green manure with Sesbania treatments reduced the grassy weed. Weeds Sphenoclea zeylanica Gaertn. and Monochoria vaginalis Presl were found in large numbers in straw-and green-manured plots and were absent in compost-applied plots.

AB A field experiment, comprising 10 treatment combinations of 5 systems of manuring to rice (Oryza sativa L.) and 2 levels of NPK to wheat (Triticum aestivum L. emend. Fori & Paol.) was conducted in rice-wheat cropping system during 1994-95 to 1996-97. Yield of rice varied significantly due to systems of manuring to rice but not due to level of NPK to wheat. Wheat yield, on the other hand, varied significantly due to both the systems of manuring to the preceding crop and the level of NPK to wheat. The system productivity was the maximum (79.18 q/ha rice-equivalent yield) with application of 100% recommended dose of NPK through fertilizer to both the crops. Combined application of green-manure and 50% NPK to rice and 100% NPK to wheat recorded identical system productivity indicating that 50% NPK of rice in rice-wheat system can be substituted by green-manure without appreciable sacrifice in yield. Net monetary return and the benefit : cost ratio of the system were the maximum (Rs 13,962/ha and 1.64 respectively) with application of 100% NPK through fertilizer to each crop.

AB A field experiment was conducted during the spring season of 1997 and 1998 at Baruipur, West Bengal, to evaluate the economically and biologically sustainable intercrop association of sesame (Sesamum indicum L.) with greengram (Phaseolus radiatus L.), blackgram (P. mungo L), groundnut (Arachis hypogaea L.), and sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) on rice fallow land. An intercropping of groundnut with sesame was found most beneficial to sole stand yield of sesame. Among the intercrop associations, sesame + groundnut under 3:2 row proportion gave the maximum sesame-equivalent yield (947 kg/ha), land-equivalent ratio (1.31), product of relative crowding coefficient (K 3.87), monetary advantage (Rs 2,913/ha), net returns (Rs 5, 321/ha), income equivalent ratio (1.21) and also indicated a modest competitive ratio (0.86:1.16) and aggressivity factor (+/- 0.37). It proved the best intercrop stand among all the crop associations.

ID DEMOCRACY
AB The essay explores the role educational institutions can play in fostering sustainable development, a framework based on the integration of the economic, social, and environmental dimensions. Sustainable development, a culture sensitive model, lends itself to reconciling competing cultures in a contemporary context driven by global demands for competition and consumerism on one extreme, while the other focuses almost exclusively on strict environmental protection. It further affirms the value of traditional or indigenous knowledge to complement modern knowledge. The paper suggests that educating for a sustainable future requires inclusion of six features: an interdisciplinary approach; teacher-training, pre- and in-service; curricula based on the three pillars of sustainable development; social and environmental justice; meaningful political participation; and respect for local and indigenous cultures.

AB The wider use of telematics in public health and patient care will be a very important strategy for Member States, and one that can help bring expert knowledge to new areas and institutions in a cost-effective and rapid manner. However, such a strategy should take into account a number of elements that are given below.
   . Health telematics systems and services should be dictated by health needs and by clinical and public health standards, not be technology-driven.
   . The values and principles of Health for All (HFA), notably equity, sustainability, participation and accountability, should apply fully to the development of health telematics.
   . Health telematics requires new skills from the relevant decision-makers, operators and users, calling for a mix of participatory education, skills training, continuing professional education and lifelong learning.
   . Given the fast rate of technological obsolescence and changing price-performance ratios, countries will benefit from closer collaboration on the development of technological standards, compatibility, open architecture, competitive prices and pilot applications.
   Managing health information developments in an effective and rational way at the level of the European Region will require the major organizations active in this field to enter into more formal agreements of cooperation than is the case today; most importantly, this will involve World Health Organization (WHO), the European Commission and Organization for Economic Go-operation and Development (OECD).

AB Energy transition is the process whereby there is an increase in the volume and proportion of commercial energy, to the extent that it replaces traditional fuels as the main source of energy and having enormous implications for the physical and biotic environment. This energy-environment process has rarely been the focus of research investigation in Africa. Using cross-national data drawn from the African continent, this paper examines and accounts for inter-country variations in the nature and extent of the energy transition process. The empirical analysis reveals that, for the continent as a whole, the extent to which commercial energy replaces traditional fuels is quite low. It varies between 33% and 39%. However, inter-country variations were found to be as high as 90% in countries such as Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco and South Africa; and less than 15% for such countries as Benin, Burkina Faso, The Central African Republic, Ethiopia, Lesotho and Uganda. The key factors explaining inter-county variations in the energy transition process are the level of urbanization and the extent of forest and woodland resources. Other factors of secondary importance include economic growth, incidence of poverty, affordability of electrical appliances, energy trade status of the country in question and the price of commercial fuel. Finally, the paper shows that the identification of these key energy transition-inducing variables is a necessary prerequisite to an effective energy and environmentally sustainable development policy formulation in Africa.

DE slope failure; irrigated rice terraces; water management;
   sustainability; Himalaya; Nepal
AB In the wetter areas of the Himalaya, irrigated terraces for the growing of rice (paddy) are the mainstay of the agricultural economy. Increasing population pressure is encouraging farmers to change from a single irrigated crop to double irrigation of terraces and from rainfed (bari) terraces to irrigated terraces. This change places a premium on the efficient use of the, often dwindling, water supply. As this study in the Middle Hills of Nepal has shown, irrigated terrace risers often experience extensive slope failures. Although such failures are relatively insignificant in land degradation terms, they are labour intensive with respect to remedial measures and create management problems. The results also suggest that it is the recent conversion of bari terraces to irrigated terraces that are experiencing most problems. There is also the implication that the landscape has almost reached the point where further expansion of irrigated terraces is unsustainable. If food production is to be increased, other cropping systems will need to be considered, with more attention being paid to the sustainable use of rainfed terraces.

AB Despite the fact that indigenous inhabitants have sustainably managed the forests and woodlands for centuries, Ethiopia's woodland resources are now under severe pressure. At the request of the Ethiopian Government, in 1996/97 the Savanna Woodland Management Study Project was initiated by the German Technical Cooperation (GTZ). A detailed analysis of the woodland resources in SW Ethiopia and a vegetation map were produced. The map was generated using multispectral remote-sensing data, and provides details of the variety within Ethiopian woodlands. A hybrid data classification procedure was applied to incorporate relief and climatic conditions. After analysis of the remote sensing data by image processing, a spatial overlay was performed to incorporate the additional site condition factors. The vegetation map shows the spatial distribution of all existing woodland types in the area and enhances our knowledge of the rich biodiversity of SW Ethiopia. Such mapping gives us a better understanding of existing ecosystems and indigenous land-use systems, and hence, can lead to more sustainable management of the natural resources in the future.

ID MONOPOLISTIC COMPETITION; INTERNATIONAL-TRADE; DIVERSIFICATION;
   DIFFERENTIATION; PERFORMANCE; ECONOMIES; MARKET; GOODS; SCALE
AB A definition of technological pluralism and diversity is presented, together with a concept of viability, within the context of sustainable development. The existing contrast with technological homogeneity is also discussed in order to show that the former concept is a necessary prerequisite for the pursuit of sustainability, whereas the latter has led to a process of cultural homogenisation, with the generally acknowledged repercussions for past and present forms of development. The availability of a number of different viable options can be considered a fundamental prerequisite for the most appropriate choice to be made by both producers and consumers; whereas, if only one technical solution is available and ready to be implemented (or requires only marginal modifications), then producers from the various socioeconomic sectors are obliged to implement that solution. This may sometimes have its advantages but very often will have serious drawbacks which may well impede the pursuit of sustainability.
   The question of the current form of product diversification is also analysed to see whether it may be advantageous within a sustainable society, and to discover if there is any contrast between this type of diversification and technological pluralism/diversity, and how this contrast may be overcome.
