AB Various global studies have shown that marine currents have large potential as a predictable sustainable resource for commercial scale generation of electrical power. For successful exploitation of this resource, an understanding of the hydrodynamics of the marine current turbine is of primary importance. Although a lot can be learned from the technology transfer from wind turbines and ship propellers, there has been limited hydrodynamics research for this particular application. A methodology is presented for the hydrodynamic design of horizontal axis marine current turbines. Recent research has investigated the performance of suitable 2D section shapes both experimentally in a cavitation tunnel and with numerical simulations. A numerical model of a typical 3D rotor is used to demonstrate parametric variations of the design parameters and the use of alternative blade sections. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper examines the effects of educational campaigns on municipal solid waste management in Jaslo City (Poland). In Jaslo, a separate waste collection system for recyclables was introduced 11 years ago. Although household segregation was extensively promoted, the quality of recycled materials collected remained low. The City Council decided in 1999 to adopt a British approach to public education, based on home advisors (selected from the local schools and trained on the sustainable waste management principles) visiting as many households as possible, informing residents about the local waste segregation system, conducting a short survey about residential attitudes and behaviour, and providing people with appropriate educational materials. In 2003 and 2004, home advisors visited 687 households in the private housing estates situated in 37 streets of the city. Their effectiveness and the tonnage of recyclables segregated were monitored across the city. The educational campaign has proved a success, resulting in an increase in recycled wastes collected and the number of inhabitants participating, with the home advisors having positively influenced the way residents think and act towards the wastes they produce. Residents valued the home advisors and appreciated the involvement of young people in the campaign. The education campaign also impacted positively upon the students' (home advisors) knowledge about waste issues, and provided opportunities for students' relatives and the whole local community to become more environmentally conscious, through the process of intergenerational communication and influence.

TI Constructing civil society? Green money in transition Hungary
SO REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY
LA English
DT Article
DE Hungary; transition; mutual aid; civil society; local currencies
ID RUSSIA
AB This paper examines the construction of green money, a civil society-based initiative in Hungary as a case study of the 'institutional' approach to the transition from command to market economies in East/Central Europe, which argues for the development of civil society organizations to facilitate structural changes in the economy. The paper compares programmes developed endogenously in Hungary through the diffusion of ideas about sustainability and economic democracy through international activist networks with those developed by a Hungarian NGO with support from western aid agencies. For the former, green money was a radical project aimed at developing alternative forms of livelihood through localized money networks, while for the latter it was a tool for ameliorating transition through the construction of mutual aid and community feeling. The paper points to problems in building new civil society institutions, arguing that while some of the difficulties encountered were technical problems that reflect the poor performance of green money as a development tool, other problems reflect more structural, political and cultural problems. The paper argues that over-optimistic conceptualizations of the potential of civil society in the facilitation of inclusive transition need to be more cognisant of the difficulties in constructing civil society from the outside.

AB The biological Waste Water Treatment plants have a continuous growing importance for the sustainable development of modem society. The paper presents solutions for the control system design for the aerobic suspended growth wastewater treatment plant. Investigations have been carried out in the presence of typical disturbances taking into account the Model Predictive Control (MPC) of the soluble substrate and dissolved oxygen concentration. The combined feedback-feedforward MPC control approach improves the control performance, compared to traditional control or simple feedback MPC, due to its short setting time, reduced overshoot and multivariable character, showing benefits for industrial implementation.

AB Objective. To identify affordable, sustainable methods to strengthen trauma care capabilities in Mexico, using the standards in the Guidelines for Essential Trauma Care, a publication that was developed by the World Health Organization and the International Society of Surgery to provide recommendations on elements of trauma care that should be in place in the various levels of health facilities in all countries.
   Methods. The Guidelines publication was used as a basis for needs assessments conducted in 2003 and 2004 in three Mexican states. The states were selected to represent the range of geographic and economic conditions in the country: Oaxaca (south, lower economic status), Puebla (center, middle economic status), and Nuevo Leon (north, higher economic status). The sixteen facilities that were assessed included rural clinics, small hospitals, and large hospitals. Site visits incorporated direct inspection of physical resources as well as interviews with key administrative and clinical staff.
   Results. Human and physical resources for trauma care were adequate in the hospitals, especially the larger ones. The survey did identify some deficiencies, such as shortages of stiff suction tips, pulse oximetry equipment, and some trauma-related medications. All of the clinics had difficulties with basic supplies for resuscitation, even though some received substantial numbers of trauma patients. In all levels of facilities there was room for improvement in administrative functions to assure quality trauma care, including trauma registries, trauma-related quality improvement programs, and uniform in-service training.
   Conclusions. This study identified several low-cost ways to strengthen trauma care in Mexico. The study also highlighted the usefulness of the recommended norms in the Guidelines for Essential Trauma Care publication in providing a standardized template by which to assess trauma care capabilities in nations worldwide.

AB Analysing sustainable forestry at a national level involves many stakeholder groups and multiple resources; thus, analyses tend to be complicated. To evaluate the consequences of different policy options, scenario analyses often are carried out to assess effects in terms of what goods and services can be obtained from forests. This article concerns the provision of input data to such studies. Owing to the complexity of the analyses and the rapid development in the area of forest inventory methodology it is not straightforward to decide how input data should be acquired. This article provides a framework for how analyses of this type can be addressed as well as a case example to illustrate how different data acquisition methods may be evaluated. The framework comprises two steps: the first is to identify the demand of data connected to the resources included in the analysis; the second step is characterizing the quality of inventory data provided by the data acquisition strategy. As an example, three data acquisition strategies were evaluated; none of them was found to be optimal from all points of views and thus the study concludes with a presentation of an integrated method for data acquisition that is based on data from sampled landscape patches.

AB The oasis expansion and economic development of the Manas River Valley is one of the most successful examples in Xinjiang. In this paper, the oasis spatial distribution pattern and dynamic change were examined using imageries of Landsat MSS, TM and ETM, land use and topographic maps in six different periods (such as 1949, 1962, 1976, 1989, 1999 and 2001) over the last 50 years in the valley. The oasis expansion process could be divided into two stages according to the annual rate of oasis area increase, the fast oasization stage (from 1949 to 1976) when the oasis area expanded from 156.385 km(2) in 1949 to 3,639.491 km(2) in 1976 because of rapidly increased population and quickly enlarged farmland area; and the urbanization stage (from 1976 to 2001) when the expansion ratio of farmland slowed down, and the urbanization process quickened, the total oasis area reached 5042.440 km(2) in 2001. With the continuous expansion of oasis and farmland, a large quantity of river water was drawn into irrigation ditch and plain lakes, so only a small quantity of river water could flow into lakes, as a result, the Manas Lake dried up, salization and basification problems happened in the low-lying oasis region. The natural swamp around the lake was shrunk greatly and biodiversity decreased significantly. The driving force analysis reveals that human activities, such as reclamation and population growth, played a major role in the oasis expansion and ecological deterioration in the Manas River Valley. So further efforts should be made to improve the efficiency of water resource utility and adjust layout of the regional agricultural and animal husbandry to keep the sustainable development of oasis economic belt of the northern slope of Tianshan Mts.

AB Paper recycling gives rise to significant volumes of secondary waste materials which undermine its economic and environmental sustainability. In response to this problem, a waste combustion ash arising from newsprint recycling has been evaluated as a feedstock material for the hydrothermal synthesis of Al-substituted 11 angstrom tobermorites. Highly crystalline tobermorite (NRR-H2O) was obtained from a stoichiometrically optimised mixture of newsprint recycling residue, sodium silicate and calcium oxide, whereas a less well-ordered product (NRR-NaOH) was acquired when sodium hydroxide was also incorporated into the reagent mixture.
   Structural disorder within the tobermorite lattice was found to accelerate the kinetics of Cd2+ for Ca2+ ion exchange although had little impact on the total number of available exchange sites per unit formula. The Langmuir isotherm model provided a suitable description for the steady state uptake of Cd2+ by both tobermorite specimens under single metal ion batch sorption conditions, from which, maximum adsorption capacities of 167 and 179 mg g(-1) were obtained for NRR-NaOH and NRR-H2O, respectively.

ID SOUTH-AFRICA
AB The aim of the study was to identify and classify the woodlands, bushland and grasslands of the Umkhanyakude Integrated Sustainable Rural Development Node (also known as Maputaland) into homogenous management units to assist with the natural resource audit and monitoring program initiated by the Department of Agriculture. The Node is situated in KwaZulu-Natal Province at the extreme northern border between South Africa and Mozambique. Two hundred and twenty-five surveys were conducted during March-July 2002 within 400 random plots created within ARCVIEW 3.2. Ecological data were analysed using multivariate ordination and classification techniques. Four broad plant communities within two geographically separated vegetation types were described. The Coastal Sandveld occurs on the coastal plain on recent arenaceous sediments. The Clay Thornveld occurs in the interior and is associated with a variety of terrain types and geological formations but predominantly rhyolite, basalt, shale and mudstones. Communities within the major vegetation types were differentiated based on climate (temperature and precipitation differences associated with differences in elevation and topography) and anthropogenic disturbances such as old fields, settlements and deforested plantations. The two major plant communities were subdivided into two sub-communities that can be used as management units since they have approximately the same physiognomy, grass composition and habitat characteristics. The four broad management units are the Acacia nilotica - Acacia karroo - Dichrostachys cinerea Community (Clay Thornveld); the Cissus rotundifolia - Enteropogon monostachyos (Valley Bushveld) Community; the Panicum maximum - Brachylaena discolor Community (Coastal Bushveld) and the Themeda triandra - Urelytrum agropyroides Community (Grass - Palmveld).

AB The Drakensberg Alpine Centre (DAC) of southern Africa supports a speciose number of angiosperms. Its compliment of 2520 native angiosperms is comparable with the native floras of northern hemisphere countries such as Germany or Switzerland, and is almost double that of Great Britain. Levels of angiosperm endemism and near-endemism in the DAC too are high, that are here treated within a conservation framework to draw attention to the local and global significance of its biodiversity. The DAC supports some 334 endemic and 595 near-endemic angiosperms, meaning that almost 37% if its flora is confined to a core region south of the Limpopo River. Strict endemism is c. 13%, slightly lower than the 16% endemism for KwaZulu-Natal, arid substantially lower than endemism (c. 69%) in the Cape Floristic Region. Most endemic and near-endemic taxa belong to the Asteraceae, Scrophullariaceae and Iridaceae, which are the largest, fourth largest and seventh largest angiosperm families in the DAC respectively. Helichrysum and Senecio contribute the most endemics and near-endemics. Many of the endemics are rare, and have very specific habitat preferences. Some 42% of the endemic taxa, and 16% of the near-endemic taxa, are Red Data species. Here we add a further 42 endemic taxa (c. 13%) to the Orange List, bringing the total number of endemics that are now either Red or Orange Data listed to 182 (c. 55%); their conservation needs to be prioritised. A strong plea is made for the continued sustainable management and protection of biota in the DAC, and the mitigation of any threats that may lead to their demise. (c) 2005 SAAB.

ID SENSE; PLACE
AB Part 1 (Hay, 2005) reviewed the root causes of our society's unsustainable condition and introduced a new approach, becoming ecosynchronous, to discuss how the unfolding of self (becoming) and being aware of events that are meaningfully related (synchronicity) can help us to get in sync with nature and become more sustainable. In Part 2, becoming ecosynchronous is examined further to present a comprehensive program toward achieving sustainability. Ways in which personal development can be considered and advanced in a sustainability framework are demonstrated, with reference to an ecocentric position. Orientation, contexts, meaningful relations, developing a sense of place, adult development (as part of becoming) and synchronicity (as tied to a revised view of reality) are discussed first. The development of a culture Of permanency, to address our society's soul sickness, is explored in the conclusion, via practical applications, aspects of societal transformation and principles of becoming ecosynchronous.

   institutional arrangement assessment matrix; sustainability elements
AB The international call for sustainable development prompted the Canadian government to mandate the creation of sustainable development strategies by federal agencies. These strategies, now in their second generation, represent the expression of sustainable development from a policy perspective, and require careful consideration. A workable matrix combines key elements of sustainable development with fundamental management element guides. This matrix is used to assess the sustainability strategies of three federal government departments concerned with Canada's natural resources. Examination reveals considerable changes in sustainable development strategies regarding processes, mechanisms and structures. Attention is also drawn to governance structures, community involvement and diversity in decision-making. Although not a panacea, these second generation strategies more fully reflect elements associated with sustainable development. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

TI Management of community-based energy interventions in rural areas of
   India: Issues and perspectives
SO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Development priorities of communities are seldom considered and local stakeholders are often not engaged in planning and implementation programmes for improving quality of life. Energy interventions, particularly, face an up-hill task in this regard because of the sheer absence of effort to link energy concerns with other developmental priorities of communities. Organizing the community around a particular issue is a highly complicated task, largely because of issues such as 'ownership' of asset(s) and equity in cost and benefit sharing.
   The paper brings forth the critical factors that may determine the success or failure of community-level energy interventions through a social analysis of three village-level experiences of installing solar photovoltaic pumps for domestic use in northern India. The lessons derived hold particular relevance within the current policy framework, in which technology alone is not sustainable unless appropriate investments in building human and institutional capacity are made.

AB In its preparatory activities for the World Summit on Sustainable Development, UNIDO requested national experts in 18 developing and transition economies to report on sustainable development planning efforts during the 1990s in terms of (1) generation of statistical information about the economic, social and environmental impacts of the manufacturing sector, (2) involvement of the manufacturing sector in the preparation of sustainable development strategies and (3) enactment of new policies and programmes. The experts found little information about the impacts of industry on environmental quality in the more explicit environmental frameworks, such as national environmental action plans, and next to nothing in these documents on the positive impacts of industry. Furthermore, the experts found little change in institutional arrangements regarding generation of information, involvement of industry and new policies and programmes, with a few notable exceptions in terms of new information generation and integrated policy innovation.

AB This paper is an endeavour to give an alternative definition for sustainable development (SD). It reviews the previous works in this area, and finds common grounds of these works, namely dynamism and quantification of the system. The paper then discusses dynamic stability and relates it to the concept of sustainability. it constructs an analogy between sustainability objectives and dynamic stability. The discussion continues to introduce chaos as one inherent characteristic of socio-economic systems because of their nonlinear behaviour. A new definition of SD is then proposed. It is applied to the dynamic models that describe the inter-relationships of environmental, economic and social variables. Finally, an example system has been employed to show the applicability of the definition. Policy-related parameters have been chosen to show the conditions in which the system is sustainable. This exercise shows that the presented method of identifying the conditions of sustainability could be usefully exploited in making decisions at macro levels.

DT Article
ID HISTORY
AB The present essay examines the concepts of path dependence and change of political and economic regimes. Starting from the debate of the influence of the so called military revolution on the emergence of modern states, the neglected aspect of the influence of seapower on socioeconomic change is presented, using a formal model. It is maintained that the choice of seapower by a state leads to a different regime than the choice of land military power, because sustainable seapower necessitates a wide alliance of interests, which brings with it more democratic regimes, develops new more efficient and complex forms of organizations, requires the acquisition and diffusion of new knowledge and expertise, which brings with it institutional change and economic growth. The essay concludes with a short presentation of the United Provinces' (the Dutch Republic) turn to the sea.

TI Peace building and state-building in Afghanistan: constructing
   sovereignty for whose security?
SO THIRD WORLD QUARTERLY
LA English
DT Article
AB In the aftermath of civil wars, international actors often worry about the incoherence, tribalism, and division of war-torn nation-states like Afghanistan. However, the problems encountered in the Afghanistan recovery and reconstruction effort illustrate that the divisions, rivalries and fragmentation of authority of the 'international community' have constituted just as big an obstacle to what the UN now calls 'peace building'. Sustainable stability and peace, to say nothing of democracy, require international actors to delegate some sovereign functions to a multilateral entity that can reinforce rather than undermine the institutions responsible for the reconstruction of the nation-state. The history and contemporary situation in Afghanistan makes clear that there is an important need for the peace-building mechanisms proposed by the UN Secretary-General's High-level Panel. This would involve a unified international decision-making body that would act as a counterpart to the recipient national government and potentially bring order to the anarchy that invariably flows from the multiple agendas, doctrines and aid budgets of the array of external actors involved in 'peace building' in Afghanistan and elsewhere.

DT Article
AB This article compares Britain's failed attempt at building a stable, liberal state in Iraq from 1914 to 1932 with the USA's struggle to stabilise the country after regime change in April 2003. It sets out a template for endogenous state-building based on the evolution of the European state system. It then compares this to exogenous extra-European state-building after both World War I and the Cold War. It focuses on three key stages: the imposition of order, the move from coercive to administrative capacity and finally the evolution of a collective civic identity linked to the state. It is this process against which Iraqi state-building by the British in the 1920s and by the USA from 2003 onwards can be accurately judged to have failed. For both the British and American occupations, troop numbers were one of the central problems undermining the stability of Iraq. British colonial officials never had the resources to transform the despotic power deployed by the state into sustainable infrastructural capacity. Instead they relied on hakumat al tayarra (government by aircraft). The dependence upon air power led to the neglect of other state institutions, stunting the growth of infrastructural power and hence state legitimacy. The US occupation has never managed to impose despotic power, having failed to obtain a monopoly over the collective deployment of violence. Instead it has relied on 'indigenisation', the hurried creation of a new Iraqi army. The result has been the security vacuum that dominates the south and centre of the country. The article concludes by suggesting that unsuccessful military occupations usually end after a change of government in the intervening country. This was the case for the British in May 1929 and may well be the case for the USA after the next presidential election in 2008.

TI Tourist sector perceptions of natural hazards in Vanuatu and the
   implications for a small island developing state
SO TOURISM MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID RISK
AB Tourism is a popular catalyst for socio-economic development in many small island developing states (SIDS). However, exposure to damaging natural hazards in these nations exacerbates the tourism industry's intrinsic vulnerabilities. The reliance of SIDS on the income-multiplying benefits of tourism make the sustainability of the industry imperative, but the vulnerability of tourism to natural hazards endangers this sustainability. The perception of natural hazards held by tourism managers may influence the adoption of appropriate mitigation and preparedness measures and thus, decrease vulnerability and increase sustainability. Accordingly, this paper presents the method and findings of a pilot study into the accuracy of natural hazard perceptions held by members of the tourism industry in Tanna, an island in the South West Pacific SIDS of Vanuatu. The study finds that perceptions are generally accurate within the industry. However, there is scope for improvement in the prevalence of accurate perceptions. It is recommended that this be achieved through the development and implementation of a comprehensive natural hazards awareness strategy, details of the format and structure of such a strategy are detailed within.

AB One of the first successes of plant biotechnology has been the creation and commercialisation of transgenic crops exhibiting resistance to major insect pests. First generation products encompassed plants with single insecticidal Bt genes with resistance against major pests of corn and cotton. Modelling studies predicted that usefulness of these resistant plants would be short-lived, as a result of the ability of insects to develop resistance against single insecticidal gene products. However, despite such dire predictions no such collapse has taken place and the acreage of transgenic insect resistance crops has been increasing at a steady rate over the 9 years since the deployment of the first transgenic insect resistant plant. However, in order to assure durability and sustainability of resistance, novel strategies have been contemplated and are being developed. This perspective addresses a number of potentially useful strategies to assure the longevity of second and third generation insect resistant plants.

AB We present anew model of tree growth, DESPOT (Deducing Emergent Structure and Physiology Of Trees), in which carbon (C) allocation is adjusted in each time step to maximize whole-tree net C gain in the next time step. Carbon gain, respiration and the acquisition and transport of substitutable photosynthetic resources (nitrogen, water and light) are modeled on a process basis. The current form of DESPOT simulates a uniform, monospecific, self-thinning stand. This paper describes DESPOT and its general behavior in comparison to published data, and presents an evaluation of the sensitivity of its qualitative predictions by Monte Carlo parameter sensitivity analysis. DESPOT predicts determinate height growth and steady stand-level net primary productivity (NPP), but slow declines in aboveground NPP and leaf area index. Monte Carlo analysis, wherein the model was run repeatedly with randomly different parameter sets, revealed that many parameter sets do not lead to sustainable NPP. Of those that do lead to sustainable growth, the ratios at maturity of net to gross primary productivity and of leaf area to sapwood area are highly conserved.

AB Problems have been identified in the delivery of extension messages about the maintenance of healthy and well-fed working animals. The different factors that need to be considered in developing effective disease control and prevention programmes for working oxen and equids including vector-borne diseases, helminth disease, and vaccination programmes have been reported and discussed and experiences in improving husbandry including footcare, harness, and worm management reported. Most draught animals are owned by people who lack the financial means to pay for or to access the information needed on nutritional supplements, vaccinations and drug treatment. Smallholder farms are often remote from veterinary services, thereby requiring greater emphasis on preventive measures and local remedies. Several NGOs have traditionally provided static and mobile treatment teams for equines and training courses for farriers and harness makers. The effectiveness and sustainability of these services and ways in which delivery of health care and husbandry messages could be delivered to improve impact are discussed.

TI The state of South African cities a decade after democracy
SO URBAN STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
AB Like other national urban policy documents, the State of the Cities Report 2004 affirms a vision of an inclusive non-racial city in which democracy is stable and development flourishes. But the 2004 report is different from preceding urban policy statements in a number of critical respects, not least that it is not a formal statement of government. In part, the relative autonomy of the Report's sponsor, the South African Cities Network (a quango of state and non-state affiliates), explains its divergent analytical point of departure in the assessment of the state of the cities 10 years after democracy. The 2004 report is premised on the notion that changing the racial pattern of inequality hinges on systematic responses to the material forces, demographic, economic, environmental and institutional, that shaped the inherited apartheid city form. The 2004 report is also different from earlier government policy positions in that it argues that urban development is not just a site of national reconstruction and development, but that the urban question lies at the heart of achieving the national vision of a productive, democratic and non-racial society based on a vision of sustainable human settlements.

AB Simulation of water and nutrient processes can enhance intensive agriculture to help feed the world's population in a sustainable manner. Due to excessive N application, environmental protection and agricultural sustainability have become major issues in agriculture. In this study, we calibrated and tested the RZWQM model to assess N management in a double-cropping system comprised of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and corn (Zea mays L.) at Luancheng, in the North China Plain. Data, including biomass, grain yield, soil water, and soil and crop N, were used from 2001-2003 field trials applying 200 to 800 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) for five cropping seasons. In general, soil water, biomass, and grain yields were predicted better than plant N uptake or soil residual N. Once it had been tested and used to improve the understanding of N processes in this cropping system, the model was further used to evaluate the effects of alternative water and N management scenarios on N leaching. Typical application rates of both water and N could be reduced by about half based on these results, which would have high economic, social, and environmental impacts in China. The results also demonstrate the potential of RZWQM for evaluating N and water management practices in other regions and climates of the world with intensive agriculture.

ID MANAGEMENT
AB A new model has been developed for evaluating the overall resource consumption and environmental impacts of municipal solid waste management systems by the use of life cycle assessment. The model is named EASEWASTE (Environmental Assessment of Solid Waste Systems and Technologies) and is able to compare different waste management strategies, waste treatment methods and waste process technologies. The potential environmental impacts can be traced back to the most important processes and waste fractions that contribute to the relevant impacts. A model like EASEWASTE can be used by waste planners to optimize current waste management systems with respect to environmental achievements and by authorities to Set Guidelines and regulations and to evaluate different strategies for handling of waste. The waste hierarchy has for decades been governing waste management but the ranking of handling approaches may not always be the most environmentally friendly. The EASEWASTE model can identify the most environmentally sustainable solution, which may differ among waste materials and regions and can add valuable information about environmental achievements from each process in a solid waste management system.

AB The goal of the proposed project was to develop an anaerobic fermentation process that converts negative-value organic wastes into hydrogen-rich gas in a continuous-flow reactor under different operating conditions. such as hydraulic retention time (HRT), heat treatment, pH, and substrates. A series of batch tests were also conducted in parallel to the continuous study to evaluate the hydrogen conversion efficiency of two different organic substrates, namely sucrose and starch. A heat shock (at 90 degrees C for 15 minutes) was applied to the sludge in an external heating chamber known as sludge activation chamber, as it method to impose a selection pressure to eliminate non-spore-forming, hydrogen-consuming bacteria and to activate spore germination. The experimental results showed that the heat activation of biomass enhanced hydrogen production by selecting for hydrogen-producing, spore-forming bacteria. The batch feeding at a shorter HRT or 20 hours (or higher organic loading rate) favored hydrogen production, whereas, at if longer HRT of 30 hours, methane was detected in the gas phase. The major organic acids of hydrogen fermentation were acetate, butyrate, and propionate. Up to 23.1% of influent chemical oxygen demand wits consumed in biomass synthesis. Batch tests showed that the hydrogen-production potential of starch wits lower than sucrose, and better conversion efficiency from starch wits obtained at a lower pH of 4.5. However. addition of sucrose to starch improved the overall hydrogen-product ion potential and hydrogen-production rate. This study showed that sustainable biohydrogen production from carbohydrate-rich substrates is possible through heat activation of settled sludge.

AB One of the principal components of the contaminant load in urban stormwater runoff is oil and grease (O&G) pollution, resulting from vehicle emissions. A mulch layer was used as a contaminant trap to remove O&G (dissolved and particulate-associated naphthalene, dissolved toluene, and dissolved motor oil hydrocarbons) from a synthetic runoff during a bench-scale infiltration study. Approximately 80 to 95% removal of all contaminants from synthetic runoff was found via sorption and filtration. Subsequently, approximately 90% of the sorbed naphthalene, toluene. oil, and particulate-associated naphthalene was biodegraded within approximately 3, 4, 8, and 2 days after the event, respectively, based on decreases in contaminant concentrations coupled with increases of microbial populations. These results indicate the effectiveness and sustainability of placing a thin layer of mulch on the surface of a bioretention facility for reducing O&G pollution from urban stormwater runoff.

ID SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; MARGIN
AB The population of the St. Lawrence Lowlands platform in south-western Quebec, Canada, is heavily dependent on groundwater. The present study summarizes the quantity, quality and sustainability estimations of the groundwater resources found mainly in sedimentary rock aquifers. Results show that the regional groundwater flow in the considered domain of 1,500 km(2) is 97.7 Mm(3)/y with: 86.6% infiltration from precipitation, 9.6% inflow from neighboring aquifers, and 3.8% induced recharge. The regional sustainability is defined with simulated drawdowns from uniform withdrawal scenarios. The current withdrawal rate of 18 Mm(3)/y results in median drawdown of 0.6 m, compared to pre-development conditions. This drawdown is situated well in the sustainable range, an indication that regional aquifers are not overexploited. Hypothetical pumping rate of 24 Mm(3)/y resulting in an average drawdown of 2.2 m is estimated as sustainable limit. Increasing exploitation from 24 to 51 Mm(3)/y would need tight control and planning. Pumping rates beyond 51 Mm(3)/y are judged not sustainable as regional drawdowns become high, similar to 8 m. The water levels in recharge areas are the most sensitive to groundwater extraction. Combining drawdown maps, groundwater quality zones, and aquifer vulnerability to surface contamination delineated the areas most suitable for future groundwater developments.

AB Mexico's garment exports to the United States soared in the mid-1990s, and recently Honduras has become one of the fastest-growing exporters in the Americas, We find little evidence that the apparel sector's dynamism is generating conditions for endogenous growth and sustainable development in either country, however. In spite of differences in the industrial organization of export-oriented garment production in Mexico and Honduras, the countries face similar challenges: regulatory regimes with rules of origin designed to benefit US fabric manufacturers, competitive pressures from China, and the broader institutional and macroeconomic environments associated with the region's liberalization strategy.

AB There is sufficient evidence indicating the efficacy of interventions in reducing risk factors, increasing protective factors, preventing psychiatric symptoms and new cases of mental disorders. Macro-policy interventions to improve nutrition, housing and education or to reduce economic insecurity have proven to reduce mental health problems. Specific interventions to increase resilience in children and adolescents through parenting and early interventions, and programmes for children at risk for mental disorders such as those who have a mentally ill parent or have suffered parental loss or family disruption, have also shown to increase mental well-being and decrease depressive symptoms and the onset of depressive disorders. Interventions for the adult population, from macro-policy strategies, such as taxation of alcohol products or workplace legislation, to individual support for those with signs of a mental disorder, can reduce mental health problems and associated social and economic burdens. Exercise, social support or community participation have also shown to improve mental health of older populations. Public mental health will benefit from continuing building the evidence base through combining different evaluation methods across low, middle and high income countries. The translation of evidence into policy and practice calls for action at the international, national and local level, including building capacity, advocacy, mainstreaming mental health into public health and other policies and securing infrastructures and sustainability. Mental health professionals have an important role to play in improving the evidence on prevention and promotion in mental health, in engaging relevant stakeholders for developing programmes, and as professional care providers in their practice.

AB Vector optimization techniques were used to generate arbitrary segments of a policy frontier for a dynamic yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) fishery model assuming fixed technology and considering four policy objectives: minimizing dolphin mortality, minimizing incidental catch (all species except dolphins), maximizing sustainable yield, and minimizing biological risk for the yellowfin tuna stock. Results show that along the policy frontier: (1) reducing incidental dolphin mortality increases the incidental catch of other species in a nonlinear way; (2) yield increases (subject to a biomass precautionary level) can only be obtained at the expense of higher levels of dolphin mortality and incidental catch; (3) biological risk increases as the level of tunas caught increases, but this increase depends on the type of fishery (longline fishing and three different modes of purse-seining: log-sets, dolphin-sets or school-sets) that dominates the fishing effort; (4) there is an indirect relationship between the dolphin mortality levels and those of biological risk; (5) there is a direct relationship between the incidental catch levels and biological risk. Catch obtained with dolphin-sets dominates the Pareto-optimal solutions with highest dolphin mortality levels but is associated with lower biological risk, whereas catch obtained with log-sets dominates in Pareto-optimal solutions with higher incidental catch and higher biological risk. In general, trade-offs or shadow prices among objectives are not linear, indicating that marginal costs vary along the policy frontier. Results of the trade-off analysis may provide useful information for decision-makers and other policy actors. Complete information about the preferences of the decision-makers regarding the objectives is necessary to recommend a specific management policy. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The relative proportions of metal residing in ore in the lithosphere, in use in products providing services, and in waste deposits measure our progress from exclusive use of virgin ore toward full dependence on sustained use of recycled metal. In the U.S. at present, the copper contents of these three repositories are roughly equivalent, but metal in service continues to increase. Providing today's developed-country level of services for copper worldwide (as well as for zinc and, perhaps, platinum) would appear to require conversion of essentially all of the ore in the lithosphere to stock-in-use plus near-complete recycling of the metals from that point forward.

AB Under two contrasting light regimes (full sun and 45% shade) and the optimal coffee-growing conditions of the central valley of Costa Rica, production pattern, bean characteristics and beverage quality were assessed over two production cycles on dwarf coffee (Coffea arabica L. cv. Costa Rica 95) trees with varying fruit loads (quarter, half and full loads) imposed by manual fruit thinning. Shade decreased coffee tree productivity by 18% but reduced alternate bearing. Shade positively affected bean size and composition as well as beverage quality by delaying berry flesh ripening by up to 1 month. Higher sucrose, chlorogenic acid and trigonelline contents in sun-grown beans pointed towards incomplete bean maturation and explained the higher bitterness and astringency of the coffee beverage. Higher fruit loads reduced bean size owing to carbohydrate competition among berries during bean filling. These results have important implications in terms of agricultural management (shade, fruit thinning, tree pruning) to help farmers increase coffee plantation sustainability, produce coffee beans of larger size and higher quality and ultimately improve their revenues, especially during times of world overproduction.

AB The maximum power principle is a potential guide to understanding the patterns and processes of ecosystem development and sustainability. The principle predicts the selective persistence of ecosystem designs that capture a previously untapped energy source. This hypothesis was investigated empirically in controlled and replicated tests conducted in planktonic microcosms. Microecosystems that developed under a pH-controlled light regime, in which light duration was altered based on changes in an ecosystem-controllable variable (water column pH), were compared with those that developed under fixed photoperiods. According to the principle, pH-decreasing (and power-increasing) organization should selectively persist under pH-controlled light. To assess changes in pH dynamics that occurred under the alternative selection regime, in which photoperiods were not linked with pH-affecting selection or organization, the microecosystems that developed under fixed photoperiods were subjected to pH-controlled light on the last day of each test. The daily light duration increased 506 min on average in microecosystems that developed under pH-controlled light and 412 min on average in microecosystems that developed under fixed photoperiods. Selective reinforcement of acid-secreting blue-green algae in response to CO, and nutrient limitations could account for the greater increase in power acquisition in microecosystems that developed under pH-controlled light.

AB A large range of models has been developed for the analysis of optimal forest management strategies, with the well-known Faustmann models dating back to the mid-19th century. To date, however, there has been relatively little attention for the implications of complex ecosystem dynamics foroptimal forest management. This paper xamines the implications of irreversible ecosystem responses for efficient and sustainable forest management. The paper is built around two forest models that comprise two ecosystem components, forest cover and topsoil, the interactions between these components, and the supply of the ecosystem services 'wood' and 'erosion control'. The first model represents a forest that responds in a reversible way to overharvesting. In the second model, an additional ecological process has been included and the ecosystem irreversibly collapses below certain thresholds in forest cover and topsoil depth. The paper presents a general model, and demonstrates the implications of pursuing efficient as well as sustainable forest management for the two forest ecosystems. Both fixed and variable harvesting cycles are examined. Efficient and sustainable harvesting cycles are compared, and it is shown that irreversible ecosystem behaviour reduces the possibilities to reconcile efficient and sustainable forest management through a variable harvesting cycle.

AB In this work, the authors intend to introduce to the scientific community a novel integrated approach to environmental impact assessment, appropriately named SUstainability Multicriteria Multiscale Assessment (SUMMA). Its main objective is to overcome the inherent shortcomings of all single-criterion approaches, which constitute the vast majority of the Life Cycle Assessments performed to date in the scientific literature, and which invariably lead to partial and often misleading results. Furthermore, SUMMA is structured so as to enable a consistent sensitivity analysis of all the calculated impact indicators, a procedure that is of crucial importance for assessing the variability and reliability of the results, but which is only rarely adopted. The suggested framework is applied to selected case studies (coal gasification, bauxite mining, aluminium production and fuel cell manufacture), the results of which are discussed.

AB Background - Critics remain skeptical about the long-term sustainability of Medicare in Canada because of the proliferation of health technology and escalating expenditures. The objective of this study was to examine the temporal trends in the utilization and costs of cardiovascular technologies for the evaluation and/or management of patients with ischemic heart disease in Canada.
   Methods and Results - This repeated cross-sectional population-based study of Ontario residents examined the temporal trends in the utilization and costs associated with echocardiography, stress (imaging and nonimaging) testing, coronary angiography, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), and bypass surgery between 1992 and 2001. Annual costs increased by nearly 2-fold over the 10-year study period and cumulatively accounted for more than $2.8 billion (Canadian) in expenditures. The proliferation in use of cardiac testing/interventions over time outstripped both demographic shifts and changes in the prevalence of coronary artery disease. Annual increases were widespread for all procedures (P < 0.001) and ranged from 2% per year for nonimaging stress tests to 12% per year for PCI, after adjustment for age and sex. Generally, utilization rates were higher among the elderly, males, and those of low socioeconomic status. With few exceptions, annual increases in the utilization rates of cardiac tests and procedures were disproportionately higher among the elderly and women, but they were similar across socioeconomic subgroups. Increases in utilization appeared to reflect referrals toward higher-risk populations.
   Conclusions - Although definitive conclusions about the appropriateness of temporal patterns cannot be ascertained, the proliferation of cardiac testing challenges the sustainability of Medicare in Canada, especially given uncertainty as to whether the accompanying incremental rise in total expenditures translates into significant outcome benefits in the population.

AB Supercritical isobutane regeneration of an ultrastable Y-zeolite (USY) alkylation catalyst was examined in a continuous, automated reaction/regeneration system. Two feeds were studied: a synthetic isobutane/2-butene blend and a commercial refinery isoparaffin/olefin blend. Synthetic feed experiments showed that high levels of butene conversion were maintained for a time on stream of more than 200 h, and that product quality and catalyst maintenance was relatively stable over the course of the experiment, using a 3 h reaction/3 h regeneration cycle. Thirty five reaction/regeneration cycles were conducted over 210 h using the synthetic feed. Over this period, butene conversion did not drop below 92% until the end of the experiment. The average butene conversion declined 0.051% per run, and the average C-8 and trimethylpentane (TMP) composition decreased only 0.082% and 0.06%, respectively, per run. Catalyst activity maintenance was lower when the commercial feed was used. High levels of alkene conversion were maintained for 78 and 192 h, using a 3 h reaction/3 h regeneration cycle and a 2 h reaction/2 h regeneration cycle, respectively. Using a 3 h reaction/3 h regeneration cycle, alkene conversion remained at or above 92% for 13 reaction/regeneration cycles, corresponding to 78 h of semicontinuous operation. Using a 2 h reaction/2 h regeneration cycle, the alkene conversion did not drop below 92% until the end of 48 reaction/regeneration cycles, corresponding to 192 h of operation. The 2 h reaction/2 h regeneration cycle limited the decline in alkene conversion to 0.035% per run and limited the decline in C-8 and TMP composition to 0.040% and 0.042%, respectively, per run.

TI Hydrogen from coal gasification: An economical pathway to a sustainable
   energy future
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COAL GEOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE hydrogen; coal; gasification; economics
AB Although hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe, it does not occur naturally in large quantities or high concentrations on Earth. Hydrogen must be produced from other compounds such as fossil fuels, biomass, or water and is therefore considered an energy carrier like electricity. Gasification of carbonaceous, hydrogen-containing fuels is an effective method of thermal hydrogen production and is considered to be a key technology in the transition to a hydrogen economy. However, for gasification to play a major role during the transition period, capital and operating cost must be reduced and reliability and performance must be improved.
   Analyses show that hydrogen produced from coal-based gasification can be competitive with production from natural gas provided the cost of natural gas remains above $4/10(6) Btu and the high reliability of gasification-based processes can be demonstrated. But for coal to be considered in a carbon-con strained environment, the cost of natural gas would have to be greater than $5.50/10(6) Btu. The development of advanced technologies, however, offers the potential for significant reductions in capital costs, improved thermal efficiencies, and increased reliability. If these advanced technologies are capable of achieving their goals, the cost of producing hydrogen from coal could be reduced by 25-50%, even with the capture and sequestration of CO2. With these reductions, the cost of natural gas would have to be less than $2.50/10(6) Btu to compete, a scenario that is very unlikely to occur in the future. This potential cost reduction provides considerable impetus for continuing research and development in the production of hydrogen from coal. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Retrieval of recently acquired declarative memories depends on the hippocampus, but with time, retrieval is increasingly sustainable by neocortical representations alone. This process has been conceptualized as system-level consolidation. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we assessed over the course of three months how consolidation affects the neural correlates of memory retrieval. The duration of slow-wave sleep during a nap/rest period after the initial study session and before the first scan session on day 1 correlated positively with recognition memory performance for items studied before the nap and negatively with hippocampal activity associated with correct confident recognition. Over the course of the entire study, hippocampal activity for correct confident recognition continued to decrease, whereas activity in a ventral medial prefrontal region increased. These findings, together with data obtained in rodents, may prompt a revision of classical consolidation theory, incorporating a transfer of putative linking nodes from hippocampal to prelimbic prefrontal areas.

ID REPORTED ENERGY-INTAKE; LOW-CARBOHYDRATE DIETS; WEIGHT-LOSS;
   RANDOMIZED-TRIAL; PORTION SIZES; OBESITY; HEALTH; WOMEN; FAT; VALIDITY
AB Many claims about nutrition and weight loss stem from small, short-term studies, incorrect interpretations or distortions of evidence.
   Our knowledge of what people eat is poor; difficulties include accurate assessment of consumption, the complex composition of foods and individual variations in nutrient bioavailability.
   When advice appears to be ineffective, poor compliance is a likely explanation.
   There is no simple solution to obesity, and no fast way to create the energy deficit required for sustainable loss of fat-weight loss requires long-term commitment to permanently change eating and exercise habits.
   Valid advice is to reduce overall energy intake, include more vegetables, fruits and wholegrain products and fewer foods high in saturated fat, sugar and salt.
   While mindful of the need to encourage individuals to make changes, the medical profession needs to lead the charge to advocate for changes to our obesogenic environment.

AB The Bolivia study is part of an ongoing multiple case study organized by the FAO's Regional Office for Latin America and the Caribbean as part of the activities of the Technical Cooperation Network on Agricultural Biotechnology (REDBIO/FAO). The basic information was obtained through a survey and/or direct interview to a significant number of experts from Bolivian institutions involving management, regulation, research, innovation, application and education of agricultural biotechnology. At national level, the most relevant applied agri-biotechnologies are presently in vitro plant culture, genomics, molecular genetics, assisted reproduction techniques in animals, and techniques supporting plant and animal disease diagnosis. They have been developed and appropriated to support the agricultural sector including genetically modified crops. Over the past ten years, the public research and academic institutions have allocated resources to implement laboratories and others have widened and updated their facilities. Nonetheless, a different situation is observed in the private sector where some laboratories have been forced to close down and to reduce production due to the economic crisis of the country. In view of the country's specific needs and opportunities regarding conservation and utilization of genetic resources, biotechnology can constitute a valuable tool for the sustainable development of the country.

TI Future scenarios for a sustainable water sector: A case study from

LA English
DT Article
ID PRECAUTIONARY PRINCIPLE; MANAGEMENT; SYSTEMS; SCIENCE; TOOL
AB Uncertainties about the long-term prospects of urban water management systems have increased substantially over the past decade due to an increasing variety of regulations, technologies, and demand structures. In Switzerland, this uncertainty is mirrored by growing difficulties of utility managers and (waste)water scientists to agree on shared strategies: Water professionals demand support for pressing management problems, while researchers fundamentally question the longer-term sustainability of the established water management system. To reestablish shared orientation, we conducted a foresight study for the Swiss (waste)water sector in 2004. Based on interviews with 29 experts from Swiss water management and research to collect 56 drivers of change, a team of 17 experts developed three scenarios: (A) regional mergers of water utilities leading to enhanced professionalism in the sector, (B) consequent material flows management leading to a radically restructured urban water management system, and (C) generalized financial crisis leading to a breakdown of centralized utility services. These scenarios helped identifying shared research priorities. We conclude that scenario analysis is a powerful tool for framing long-term strategies, defining priorities, and integrating different interests in the multidisciplinary contexts of sustainability science, which are marked by high uncertainties and concern a wide range of stakeholder groups.

SO LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING

ID BIODIVERSITY; RESERVE
AB Between the 1980s and 1990s, conservation policy in Lombardy (NW Italy) was enhanced with the establishment of the Protected Areas System, which encompassed a wide area of nature reserves and regional parks. The main aim of the Protected Areas System was to preserve cultural, natural and traditional human activity over large areas affected by very rapid development processes.
   Currently, the Protected Areas System covers about 26% of Lombardy, and human activity within the protected areas is managed and controlled by a consistent body of rules and laws, operating in an eco-sustainable framework. The actual effect of these rules and regulations on landscape and biodiversity conservation is, however, poorly understood.
   The aims of this study are: (1) to describe the development of the Protected Areas System and its features in southern Lombardy between 1980 and 1994; (2) to confirm that avian species richness is higher in the Protected Areas System than in the related buffer zones; (3) to describe the role of the regulations and laws in establishing the Protected Areas System. The study was carried out in four regional parks of southern Lombardy, and in the related buffer areas, considered as controls. Five variables (natural habitat surface, field size, grassland availability, urban areas, and avian species richness) were compared within and outside the protected areas.
   Results are summarized as follows: during the study period, the surface covered by natural habitats decreased significantly in control (63.6%) than in protected areas (33.2%), the average field area increased 34.2% in control areas and 15.3% in protected areas, urbanized areas increased 52.3% in control areas and 15.1% in protected areas, while no significant difference was observed in grassland availability. Avian species richness was significantly higher in protected than in control areas. Results showed that despite a general reduction of the environmental value in the wider environment from the 1980s to the early 1990s, the network of protected areas effectively protected some landscape features, and successfully contributed in restraining the expansion of urban areas. Moreover, it confirmed that avian species richness is higher in the Protected Areas System than in control areas.
   Data on restraining urban development was of the utmost importance, since the Lombardy Protected Areas System included wide areas of primary urban value. These data can be partially explained by the dominant role of the Park Development Plan on the Urban Development Plan, adopted by the local municipality, and proposes the application of the precautionary principle in the simplification process, which is currently affecting the rules and laws governing protected areas in Italy.

AB Air quality monitoring data are important bases for air quality management strategies planning and performance assessment. Therefore, the environmental protection authorities need to plan the air quality monitoring network effectively. However, in Taiwan, the national Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) and some county environmental protection bureaus (EPB) separately installed their own monitoring stations. This study developed an integrated methodology and computer system for planning air quality monitoring networks. The environmental, social, and economic objectives and sub-objectives, and their weights were identified using system analysis and multiple objective planning, based on the principles of sustainable development. A multiple objective optimization model and procedure for sustainable air quality monitoring networks planning are developed in this study. According to the procedure, a multiple objective planning system for sustainable air quality monitoring networks (MOPSSAQMN) is developed using computer software based on the modified bounded implicit enumeration algorithm with the constraint arrangement method. The air quality monitoring network of Taoyuan County, in northern Taiwan, was used as a case study to demonstrate the proposed method. Two satisfactory alternatives based on different conditions were generated using MOPSSAQMN. The compared results show that this study generated better alternatives than the current monitoring network. An installation schedule for the alternative was proposed, and its first step is now being implemented by the EPB of Taoyuan County Government. The procedure and computer system developed in this study can be used to assist the competent authorities to devise good and different alternatives for air quality monitoring networks planning.

AB Little is known about factors that structure biodiversity on landscape scales, yet current land management protocols, such as forest certification programs, place an increasing emphasis on managing for sustainable biodiversity at landscape scales. We used a replicated landscape study to evaluate relationships between forest structure and avian diversity at both stand and landscape-levels. We used data on bird communities collected under comparable sampling protocols on four managed forests located across the Southeastern US to develop logistic regression models describing relationships between habitat factors and the distribution of overall richness and richness of selected guilds. Landscape models generated for eight of nine guilds showed a strong relationship between richness and both availability and configuration of landscape features. Diversity of topographic features and heterogeneity of forest structure were primary determinants of avian species richness. Forest heterogeneity, in both age and forest type, were strongly and positively associated with overall avian richness and richness for most guilds. Road density was associated positively but weakly with avian richness. Landscape variables dominated all models generated, but no consistent patterns in metrics or scale were evident. Model fit was strong for neotropical migrants and relatively weak for short-distance migrants and resident species. Our models provide a tool that will allow managers to evaluate and demonstrate quantitatively how management practices affect avian diversity on landscapes. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The establishment of woody fallow systems is an option for the improvement of degraded agricultural landscape within the ecologically deteriorated Aral Sea area in northwest Uzbekistan. Growth and development of ten tree species, differing in tolerance to drought and salinity, were studied over 24 months. To determine species suitability for afforestation, conventional diameter and height measurements were compared to Relative Growth Rate (RGR) and its underlying components, Net Assimilation Rate (NAR), Specific Leaf Area (SLA) and Leaf Weight Ratio (LWR), as well as the Crop Growth Rate (CGR) as a function of NAR and Leaf Area Index (LAI). RGRs varied between 0.46 and 2.16 mg g(-1) day(-1) and showed highly significant differences among species, but also between years, which reduces the parameter's suitability for species selection. The same is true for NAR and SLA. CGR values ranged from 0.01 to 0.71 g m(-2) day(-1), increased with age of the trees, and showed significant species differences. CGR correlated better with NAR (r = 0.89) and SLA (r = 0.86) than RGR. Overall CGR correlated highly with the RGRs in height and diameter (in 80% and 71% of all cases, respectively). Thus, CGR appears to be a suitable indicator complementing RGR, NAR and SLA estimates to decide on species suitability for afforestation. The intensive measurements for RGR should be done later, rather than earlier in the tree life cycle. At an early age, CGR and diameter measurements are more meaningful. A combination of estimates, not a single factor, best assesses the long-term sustainable growth under natural conditions and allows early selection of species suitable for afforestation of degraded patches in the agricultural landscape. Ranking of all parameters concurrently showed the high potential of Elaeagnus angustifolia and Populus euphratica, which matched previous rankings based on total biomass production and financial added value.

AB Growth of the scyllarid lobster Scyllarides astori was estimated in the Galapagos Marine Reserve by use of tag-recapture data and analysis of length-frequency distributions. Asymptotic carapace lengths (CLinfinity), obtained from Powell-Wetherall plots, were 17.53 cm for males and 16.38 cm for females. A 'forced' Gulland-Holt plot gave growth constants (K) of 0.153 yr(-1) for males and 0.162 yr(-1) for females. The narrow size distribution suggests that juveniles occupy a different spatial niche and that adult growth is either very slow or that there is a terminal moult. Currently mainly used for local consumption, there is pressure to allow exportation of S. astori on a large scale to continental Ecuador and abroad. However, its slow growth and low abundance point to the need for a cautious approach and the implementation of clear and enforceable regulations in order to ensure the biological and economical sustainability of the population.

AB Long-term trends of crop yields have been used as a means to evaluate the sustainability of intensive agriculture. Previous studies have measured yield trends from long-term rice-rice and rice-wheat experiments in different sites from the slopes of individual site regressions of yield over time. The statistical significance of each site regression was determined but not that of the aggregate trend, which could give an indication of the magnitude and significance of global yield change. The random regression coefficient analysis (RRCA) and meta-analysis were used in this study to analyze the aggregate yield trend from several long-term experiments (LTE) across the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) and outside the IGP. Both methods show that there has been a significant (p < 0.05) declining trend in rice yield in rice-wheat LTEs in South Asia including China with the recommended rates of nutrients, but that there has been no significant change in wheat and system (rice + wheat) yields. There was no significant year x region (IGP versus non-IGP) interaction in rice and wheat yields. However, RRCA showed that the average yield trend was significantly negative (-41.0 kg ha(-1) yr(-1)) only in the IGP. In the rice-rice LTEs, there was a significant year x site (IRRI versus non-IRRI sites) interaction during the dry season but not the wet season. Rice yields declined throughout Asia in the wet season. The average system (dry + wet season rice) yield trends were significantly negative in both IRRI and non-IRRI sites (-170.1 and -52.8 kg ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively) but the magnitude of yield decline was significantly greater in the IRRI sites than in the non-IRRI sites. Rice in the rice-wheat LTEs showed a significantly positive yield trend with the addition of farmyard manure (FYM) but the initial yield was generally lower with FYM than without FYM. After 15 years, yield increase due to FYM was not evident in most of the LTE. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

SO ACI MATERIALS JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
ID CEMENT; TEMPERATURE; PUMICE
AB This paper reports the results of investigations to assess the suitability of using volcanic ash (VA) as a cement replacement material in concrete production. Tests were conducted on 36 concrete mixtures, replacing 6 to 75% by mass of normal portland cement by VA. The performance of volcanic ash concrete (VAC) mixtures was evaluated by conducting comprehensive series of tests on fresh and hardened properties as well as durability. The fresh and hardened properties of the concrete were assessed by slump, air content, and compressive strength, while durability characteristics were investigated by rapid chloride permeability (RCP), drying shrinkage (DS), water permeability, mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) tests. VACs showed better durability properties compared to control concrete with 0% VA. The improved performance of VACs was attributed to the refinement of pore structure, lowering the presence of free chloride due to Friedel's salt formation and pozzolanic action due to the presence of VA. VAC having a minimum strength of 15 MPa (a requirement for some structural concrete applications) can be obtained by replacing up to 40% (by mass) of cement with VA. The development of nonexpensive and environmentally friendly VAC with acceptable strength and durability characteristics (as illustrated in this study) is helpful for the sustainable development and rehabilitation of volcanic disaster areas around the world.

AB Touristic valorisation of caves has long tradition in Croatia. Research has been conducted in order to: identify show caves in Croatia (13), make an overview of their basic geomorphologic characteristics and study their role as tourist destinations. Based on Nature Protection Law and current experiences, four different management models have been identified. Management models have been recognized as an important factor for touristic valorisation of show caves. These elements as well as linkages of show caves with local economy have been examined in more details in case studies. Paper concludes with overview on current tourist development of show caves in Croatia and proposes some future actions in that respect.

ID HUMAN IMPACT; PUGLIA
AB Karst environments are extremely vulnerable to degradation and pollution. Although the carrying capacity of these natural environments is low, a variety of human activities is implemented on karst settings generating impacts at the surface and subsurface. To evaluate the degree of disturbance to typical karst environments in the Mediterranean basin, two areas have been selected in Apulia (south-eastern Italy). The human-induced effects are being assessed by applying a recently developed Karst Disturbance Index (KDI), based on a categorical framework encompassing physical, biological, and social aspects, and the evaluation of a number of indicators for each category. Scores are assigned to the indicators, to assess the severity and the extent of the human impacts on the karst environment. Knowledge of the study areas derives from a combined use of direct experience and field surveys, and the critical evaluation of data available from research articles and local organization reports. Since this approach is an holistic and comprehensive method, different scientific branches and law issues have been considered. The results so far obtained for the study areas highlight the urgent need of a sustainable management of anthropogenic activities: for example, quarrying and stone clearing, both extensively widespread, are among the most dangerous practices for karst surface and subsurface landforms in Apulia. These activities are heavily changing the original karst landscape and causing the partial or total destruction of natural caves. This study represents a preliminary evaluation of the human disturbance to karst in Apulia, but has to be necessarily integrated by further applications in other areas of the region, aimed at a better understanding of the potentiality of the approach and its feasibility in different karst settings.

DE human impact; karst; sustainable development; Venetian Prealps; Italy
AB In the Venetian Prealps the old model of resources use was for many aspects of sustainable type, in equilibrium with the natural dynamics. Episodes of strong impact occurred only in some particular areas and in specific economical and political situations. After the Second World War dramatic changes in the resources management have taken place, induced by the urban and industrial development. The traditional system of self-sustained economy has completely collapsed and has been replaced by an open economy more dependent on that of the large urban sprawl of the plain. Such development is clearly incompatible with the local environmental dynamics and it is difficult to be modified, because it triggers self-sustaining processes. The problem to individuate new more compatible directions for the development is, for a large part, a cultural problem and it may not be solved without a cultural revolution. Local people must be helped to understand the karst geo-ecosystem, the natural realm, the landscape, the local history, and the cultural heritage. Starting from such knowledge, local people have to develop a strong sense of belonging to their own geographical units and to become and to feel protagonists, responsible of their own development, capable to lead it.

AB Pantan area is situated in the central part of the eastern Adriatic coast near town Trogir. It presents inseparable unit consisting of Pantan spring, river course with surrounding swamp area and sea coast. Particularity of the area is swamp which is unique example in this part of the eastern Adriatic coast mostly characterized by dry karst areas. Main characteristic of the spring is periodical salinity during the year with the highest salinity during summer months. Spring presents potential drinking water source under consumption that salinization problem is solved. Unfortunately due to bed watershed management water quality of Pantan spring and environment of Pantan area is highly devastated. Today Pantan area presents an example of not preserving balance between natural resources on karst and human interventions in watershed area. All future measures should be directed on rehabilitation and further protection of this valuable karst environment. Paper gives overview of the state of the spring as well as proposed measures of sustainable management directed to the preservation of this distinct karst ecosystem. As the basis for analyzing the inter-related factors that impact on the environment, DPSIR framework is used. This framework provide rational and clear guideline for analyzing the influence of pressures derived from human activities on natural environment, and the way they are changing state of the environment. Results of the analyses showed that DPSIR framework is adequate tool to shape and implement sustainable development strategy for the Pantan area. It is evident that in this process is extremely important to take into the consideration vulnerability of the karst.

AB The effect of controlled carbon dioxide environment on in vitro shoot growth and multiplication in Feronia limonia (a tropical fruit plant, Family-Rutaceae) was studied. Carbon dioxide available in the ambient air of the growth room was insufficient for in vitro growth of the shoots alone. Also, the presence of sucrose only as the C-source in the medium (without CO2), was found to be inadequate for sustainable growth and multiplication of shoots. The carbon dioxide enrichment promoted shoot multiplication and overall growth. The promotory effect of CO2 was independent of the presence of sucrose in the medium. In the presence of both CO2 and sucrose. an additive effect was observed producing maximum shoot growth. In the absence of sucrose a higher concentration of CO2(10.0)g center dot m(-3) was required to achieve photoautotrophic shoot multiplication comparable to ambient air controls. Highest leaf area per shoot cluster promoting shoot growth and multiplication was recorded under this treatment. Shoots growing on sucrose containing medium under controlled CO2 environment of 0.6 g center dot m(-3) concentration evoked better response than ambient air controls (shoots growing on sucrose containing medium) in growth room. This treatment produced the overall best response. The present study highlighted the possibility of photoautotrophic multiplication which might prove useful for successful hardening and acclimatization in tissue culture plants.

AB The authors describe their experiences in developing an economically sustainable depression care management program within Colorado Access, a non-profit Medicaid health plan. They describe high rates of mental health issues, medical comorbidities, and psychosocial barriers to care within the plan's Medicaid population. They discuss how the company redirected resources to incorporate depression care management into an intensive care management program focused on high-cost members with multiple chronic medical conditions. This strategy allowed Colorado Access to cost effectively care manage a targeted group of high-cost Medicaid recipients across multiple primary care physician (PCP) practices without requiring changes in provider workflow.

AB Behavioral health carve-out arrangements create financial disincentives for primary care providers (PCPs) to treat depression. A novel collaboration between a primary care practice, a health insurer, and a managed behavioral health organization (MBHO) allows PCPs to receive reimbursement and schedule longer appointments to care for depressed patients. This article describes the details of the arrangement, and early results of this collaboration. Early results find that financial incentives are critical for implementation, but that time incentives do not appear to motivate PCPs. Sustainability of this model will require participation of multiple primary care practices, health insurers, and MBHOs.

AB The evaluation of agricultural by-products as a means of removing pollutants from contaminated wastewater is attracting increasing interest for sustainable development applications. The present work deals with the removal of phenol and 4-chlorophenol from aqueous solutions by chemically activated olive stones. The olive stones were soaked in 50% phosphoric acid for 3 h at 443 K. After washing, the product was activated in an inert atmosphere for 2 h or 3 h at temperatures within the range 873-1023 K. The carbons thus prepared were characterized by Methylene Blue and iodine adsorption, N-2 adsorption at 77 K in conjunction with the BET equation, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Boehm titrations. The sorption capacity towards both pollutants was determined by fitting the Langmuir model to the adsorption isotherms. The optimum activation temperature and time were 1023 K and 3 h, respectively. A maximum adsorption capacity of 189 mg/g was obtained for phenol and 436 mg/g for 4-chlorophenol. In comparison, the Merck and Aldrich commercial-grade powdered activated carbons ranked lower with adsorption capacities of 145 mg/g and 179 mg/g for phenol and 244 mg/g and 316 mg/g for 4-chorophenol, respectively.

AB Compaction is becoming a great concern in crop production and the environment. Recently, three has been a need of field management based on site-specific conditions to improve sustainability of agriculture and reduce environmental damage. In the study, soil management or tillage depth was recommended nondestructively based on cone index profiles for typical Korean rice paddy fields. Field variables related to tillage, soil strength, rice growth, and other soil physical properties showed considerable spatial and vertical variations as well as significant (alpha < 0.1) correlations among them. Cone index profiles observed also varied by field sites, and maximum cone index and depth to the maximum cone index showed significant (alpha < 0.1) correlation with tilled depth as well as rice growth and other field variables. When soil management was recommended based on Cl measurements, 13.4, 16.8, and 95.3% of the total surveyed areas, and 10.6, 18.9, and 51.6% of the total soil volume were chosen for management depth of 10, 20, 40 cm, respectively, indicating that soils of many field sites would not restrict rice growth. It was concluded that the concept of site-specific soil management based on soil conditions could save labor, time, machine use, and energy.

AB The advantages of biodiesel as an alternative fuel and the problems involved in its manufacturing are outlined. The pros and cons of making biodiesel via fatty acid esterification using solid acid catalysts are examined. The main problem is finding a suitable catalyst that is active, selective, and stable under the process conditions. Various solid acids (zeolites, ion-exchange resins, and mixed metal oxides) are screened as catalysts in the esterification of dodecanoic acid with 2-ethylhexanol, 1-propanol, and methanol at 130-180 degrees C. The most promising candidate is found to be sulphated zirconia. The catalyst's stability towards thermal decomposition and leaching is tested and the effects of the surface composition and structure on the catalytic activity are discussed.

AB Although the use of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW) in academic publishing advanced since the early 1990s, the growth of electronic journals proved neither as rapid nor as significant as was initially expected. Exploratory work by information and library scientists predicted the demise of the traditional academic publishing system. The Internet and electronic journals (e-journals) were expected to change the way academia approaches scholarship and publishing, As in many other industries, immediately after the introduction of the WWW, a large number of e-journals were established, followed by a high mortality rate. The resulting dominant design for academic publishing is a continuation of existing paper journals, many with an electronic presence. A competing design is the electronic replica of a paper journal. These e-journals rarely use the full "electronicity" afforded by the Internet and usually look and feel like a paper journal.
   In this chapter, we investigate the rationale behind the slow adoption of e-journals by academia. The chapter examines the benefits and challenges introduced by e-journals vis-a-vis the objectives of academic scholarship. We conclude that all three forms of e-journals solve many of the economic and technical issues facing academic publishing such as reduced production and distribution costs, reduced time lag, increased available space and new formats. However, e-journals raise some fundamental social, political and institutional dilemmas such as the ability to control the quality of the published material, long term sustainability, institutional resistance, increased work for editors, reviewers and authors and backwards compatibility. Institutional resistance to e-journals increases in direct proportion to the level of electronicity used by these journals. These conflicts are difficult to resolve and will require a cultural change and power shift.(1)

AB Based on relative advantage assessment, the zoning of sustainable agricultural development in China is exammed. An index system of sustainable development is constructed, consisting of five supporting systems: (1) agricultural resources, (2) agricultural development, (3) environment and ecosystem, (4) rural society, and (5) science, education and management. Included in the five supporting systems are 95 factors that are selected at the provincial level as basic indices. A method of assessing relative assets/debts is then used to calculate the net assets (i.e. relative advantage) for each provincial unit. This is done for both the five supporting systems and their total capability. The assessment results are then ranked, and the geographical patterns mapped. Based on the above assessment results, the whole country is divided into nine agricultural development regions (first-level), and 22 sub-regions (second-level). The first-level zones reflect each region's direction for future sustainable agricultural development and management. The second-level zones reflect their level of development, and whether or not each sub-region has reached the basic criteria of sustainable agricultural development. A zoning at provincial level for sustainable agricultural development in China is, thereby, established. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Agricultural research in East and Southeast Asia is increasingly challenged by the search for land-use options that best match multiple development objectives of rural societies (e.g., increased income,, food security, and reduced environmental pollution). In order to support the identification of sustainable land-use options and to support decision making with respect to land use, a tool was developed for quantifying inputs and outputs of cropping systems at the field level. TechnoGIN, the tool described in this paper, integrates systems analytical and expert knowledge and different types of agronomic data enabling the assessment of inputs and Outputs of a broad range of cropping systems and the evaluation of their resource use efficiencies. By using methods of spatial aggregation in combination with linear programming, results can also be used to explore trade-offs in resource-use efficiencies at higher levels such as the farm household, municipality and province. New features in TechnoGIN compared with similar tools include the annual rotation of up to three crops, the distinction between aerobic and anaerobic growing conditions of crops, and the procedure for estimating crop nutrient uptake. TechnoGIN is illustrated with results from the Tam Duong district in North Vietnam. The design of TechnoGIN enables easy access to its data, parameters and assumptions, and rapid generation and evaluation of input-output relationships of cropping systems in order to add new information and to improve data. TechnoGIN raises awareness about the assumptions incorporated and thus supports data collection and setting of the research agenda with respect to agro-ecological processes for which knowledge is incomplete, and is relevant For showing trade-offs between production, economic and environmental impacts of different land-use systems.

DT Article
AB Developmental activities in all countries should lead to improved personal, family, community and national well-being. For natural resources in general, and agriculture in particular, development should be sustainable to preserve and maintain productive capabilities for current and future generations. This two part paper discusses general sustainable development in arid regions of sub-Saharan Africa. I As a case study it discusses the role of acacia trees in the prevention of desertification, in improving soil fertility through nitrogen fixing in soils, and the use of acacia gum collected from selected acacia species in all countries as a food ingredient and food additive. The cultivation of acacia trees and the production, harvesting and processing of acacia gum helps to improve employment and to increase incomes of poor families in arid and semi-arid regions. The second part of the paper discusses the food uses, functional and health benefits of acacia gum.

AB The Lacandon Maya of Chiapas, Mexico practice a system of swidden agroforestry that mimics the surrounding ecosystem and its successional stages. Their fields rotate through grass (milpa), and shrub (acahual) and forest fallow stages that regenerate soil, nutrients, and seed banks. Each successional stage, including the fallow stages, produces over 25 types of crops, raw materials, and medicines. Lacandon traditionally do not use fertilizers, pesticides or herbicides. An emergy evaluation of Lacandon agroforestry was conducted to quantify resource use, productivity, environmental impact, and overall sustainability. Six systems were analyzed. The Emergy Yield Ratios of the systems ranged from 4.5 to 50.7, which indicated a high level of output per purchased investments. The agroforestry systems had minimal environmental impacts as shown by Environmental Loading Ratios between 0.03 and 0.38. The Emergy Sustainability Index (ESI) of the systems ranged from 12 to 1740, indicating a high level of sustainability. The high ESI values were partially due to a large fraction of renewable resources that varied from 0.72 to 0.97. ESI was dependent upon land area devoted to the system for each family, where greater land area resulted in higher values of ESI. Labor invested did not exhibit a direct effect on sustainability.

AB This study documents wild food species in a locally managed forest by the inhabitants of nine villages in the Dolakha district, Nepal. It presents data on their diversity, and traditional knowledge on plant use, propagation and local domestication collected through household and key informant interviews, forest transects inventories and herbaria verifications. Sixty-two wild food plants belonging to 36 families were recorded; most of them (80%) have multiple uses. Many of the food plants are herbaceous (24 species) and produce fruits for consumption (46%). Most of the food plants are consumed by the local communities as snacks, and are supplementary and nutritionally important especially prior to the harvest of staple foods. Elder women (> 35 years) are the most knowledgeable group, being able to describe the use of 65% of all edibles as compared to only 23% described by young men (< 35 years). Many villagers also possess knowledge on the modes of propagation for the food plants that may be used in the process of domestication. The local communities expressed a strong desire for the establishment of community enterprises based on the wild food resources for long-term income generation sources. To accomplish this, development of collective co-operative strategies based on assessments of the biology, size of harvestable population, sustainable harvesting techniques, and marketing value and demand of promising species would be required. Moreover domestication potential based on species identified in this paper and other species that local communities have knowledge on ought to be encouraged through incentive and policy interventions.

AB Farmers are often blamed for destroying the tropical forest, especially in Laos. Converting shifting cultivation into cash crop based agriculture is frequently presented as the solution for merging forest protection and poverty alleviation, but many attempts have ended in failure. A rural development project has attempted to introduce medicinal cardamom (Amomum villosum) cultivation in the notably remote region of Phongsaly (northern Laos), for export to China. With nearly 300 ha planted, the crop now involves about 75% of the farmers in the region. Farmers fitted cardamom into their farming system, to suit their needs for sustainability with a crop compatible with existing practices. Results indicate that introducing a cash crop into a shifting cultivation region is possible if a greater attention is paid to: (i) appraise how the new crop fits into the farming systems; (ii) prioritise economic issues over agronomic matters, in particular identify markets, traders or commercial risks.

ID NITROGEN-FERTILIZATION; NO-TILLAGE; ORGANIC-CARBON; ACIDIFICATION; PH;

AB Tillage systems and nutrient management influence soil chemical properties that can impact the long-term sustainability of dryland production systems. This study was conducted to compare the effects of no-till (NT) and conventional till (CT) on the soil chemical properties and grain yield of a dryland winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)grain sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench]/corn (Zea mays L.)-fallow rotation. The effects of tillage practice over a 27-yr period (19621989) and the effect of the conversion of CT to NT over a 14-yr period (1989-2003) on selected soil chemical properties [pH, cation exchange capacity (CEC), base saturation (BS), soil organic C (SOC), K, Ca, Mg, and Bray-P] at different soil depths was determined. The acidification rate of the NT treatment from 1962 to 2003 was also determined. The study was conducted at North Platte, NE on a Holdrege silt loam (fine-silty, mixed, mesic Typic Argiustolls). In 1989, there were differences in soil chemical properties between CT and NT at some depths after 27 yr. However, in 2003, 14 yr after converting from CT to NT, there were no differences in the soil chemical properties compared with continuous NT. M 1989 and 2003, the soil chemical properties varied with soil depth. The acidification rate from 1962 to 2003 for the NT treatment in the 0- to 15-cm depth was 1.3 kmol H+ ha(-1) yr(-1). This rate of acidification represents 38% of the total potential acidity from N fertilizer applications over 41 yr. Acidification was attributed to nitrification of ammonium-based fertilizers and leaching of NO3-. Long-term winter wheat (1966-1983) and grain sorghum (1964-1988) grain yields were higher for NT (2718 and 4125 kg ha(-1)) than CT (2421 and 3062 kg ha(-1)). Retention of soil moisture as a result of increased residue cover under NT likely contributed to higher NT yields. Soil chemical properties in the wheat-sorghuni/corn-fallow rotation will likely continue to change as a result of current management practices. Lime additions may become necessary in the future to ensure the sustainability of crop production in this system.

AB A greenhouse study was conducted to determine the effects of soil type on the response of 'Russell' bermudagrass [Cynodon daclylon (L.) Pers.] to broiler litter applications. Soils included Leeper clay loam (fine, smectitic, nonacid, thermic Vertic Epiaquept), Marietta silt loam (fine-silty, mixed, active, thermic Oxyaquic Fraglossudalf), and Ruston sandy loam (fine-loamy, siliceous, semiactive, thermic Typic Paleudult). The experimental design was a randomized complete block with a split plot arrangement of treatments replicated three times. Soil was used as main plot factor and broiler litter rates of 0, 4.6, 9.2, an 13.8 Mg ha(-1) equivalent to approximately 0, 175, 350, and 525 kg total N ha(-1) yr(-1) were considered as subplot. The changes in dry matter yield (DMY) decreased in the order of Ruston > Leeper > Marietta. Regardless of soil type, broiler litter rates > 350 kg total N ha-1 did not increase DMY yield and nutrient uptake. Bermudagrass N concentration increased as broiler litter rate increased and the greatest value was recorded for Marietta soil, 24.2 g kg(-1). The large DMY observed in Ruston soil diluted plant N concentration to about 23.7 g kg-1 despite high percentage N recovery. Bermudagrass P concentration was not affected by either broiler litter rate or soil type. Bermudagrass K concentration increased as broiler litter rate increased and was greatest on Ruston soil (23.5 g kg(-1)). Recovery efficiency for N and K was approximately 60% greater in Ruston than in Marietta and Leeper soils and was reflected in residual soil NO3-N and P concentrations that decreased in the order of Marietta > Leeper > Ruston. Application of broiler litter to bermudagrass grown on the Ruston soil appears to be more sustainable.

AB In-house audit demonstrated that 49% (173/352) of patients attending routine HIV outpatient care are asymptomatic and have needs that could potentially be met by other health care professionals. We therefore evaluated the potential development and acceptability of nurse practitioner roles in contributing to HIV outpatient care. Data were collected through 26 consultation observations, 25 patient interviews, 2 patient focus groups, 22 provider interviews and 8 provider focus groups. Service users were key members of the evaluation team. With increasing HIV incidence and the change in focus of doctor-patient consultations from acute to chronic disease management, there are concerns about the sustainability of easily available routine HIV outpatient appointments using the same model of care that has prevailed over the past 20 years. Nurse practitioner models of care were considered acceptable for asymptomatic patients, including those who do not have complex issues related to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Key considerations for the role include training, supervision, referral pathways, and a clear understanding of the limitations of nursing practice. There is an emphasis on the need to consider 'new ways of working' throughout the service, rather than merely substituting or transferring clinical roles between professionals. Funding pending, nurse practitioner roles are planned for implementation in late 2004. Evaluation will determine impact on service utilization, health and economic outcomes.

AB Aluminum foam is a class of porous materials; in which closed pores are produced by a gas generation in liquid (or semi-liquid) aluminum. Aluminum foams are, generally, fabricated by heating a foamable precursor (a powder compact consisting of aluminum and TiH2 powders). Decomposition of TiH2, which is followed by a hydrogen gas release, produces bubbles in molten aluminum. In this research, aluminum foam was fabricated with the help of a chemical exothermic reaction. Titanium and boron carbide (B4C) powders were blended in the Al-TiH2 precursor as reactive powder elements. When one end of the precursor was heated, a strong exothermic reaction between titanium and B4C took place (3Ti + B4C -> 2TiB(2) +TiC + 761KJ), and the neighboring part of the precursor was heated by the heat of reaction. Hence, once the reaction happens at the end of the precursor, it propagates spontaneously throughout the precursor. The blowing process takes place at the same time as the reaction because aluminum melts and TiH2 decomposes by the heat of reaction. The advantage of this process is that the energy to make aluminum foam is not necessarily supplied form the external source, but generated form inside of the precursor. Therefore the blowing process is self sustainable (Self-Blowing Process). In this work, the effect of processing parameters on the Self-Blowing Process was observed. The processing parameters we focused on were blending ratio of the starting powders (aluminum, TiH2, titanium, B4C) and heating methods.

AB In the present study, remote sensing in the northern region of Pocone-MT was used to identify vegetation categories, which were then mapped and characterized. The goal in generating the map was to provide information needed to support sustainable use and to formulate conservation policies. Vegetation units were identified and classified using digital images that were taken in 1990 by the Landsat Thematic Mapper (c) Satellite and then processed using ERDAS software. First, the vegetation classes were systematically defined. In a preliminary interpretation of the image data. Landsat-TM bands that allowed the best visual differentiation of these classes were selected and the image was georeferenced. Routes for trips to the study area to collect ground truth data (training samples) for further supervised classification were then determined. These data were subsequently classified according to The System of Classification of Brazilian Vegetation (VELLOSO et al. 1991), which has been used in other physiognomic maps of the Pantanal, in order to make our results comparable to those from other mappings. In addition, some modifications of this system were made due to the particular characteristics of the Pantanal and the scale used for this map. Six classes and 16 subclasses were defined for part I of the vegetation map of Pantanal, Mato Grosso, Brazil, specifically, the area north of Pocone. A distinction was made between the vegetation units of the Paraguayan Depression and those of the Pantanal due to the different characteristics of the vegetation from these two regions, and particularly the role played by inundation. The phytoecological region savanna (cerrado) covers a large part of the total area (53.05 %) and consists of five sub-classes. Two forest classes were identified: seasonal semideciduous forest and seasonal deciduous forest. These two phytoecological classes occupied 16.21 % of the total mapped area: 14.45 % of the area has been strongly modified by humans (agriculture. pasture, gold mine, and construction); 0.80 % is covered during the dry season by perennial water bodies. Based upon ground truth data and regional field experience, ten eco-zones are proposed and suggestions for sustainable management and conservation measures are discussed.

TI Farming and adiposity in Samoan adults
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HUMAN BIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID BIOELECTRICAL-IMPEDANCE; BODY FATNESS; MASS
AB Samoans are experiencing some of the highest prevalences of obesity and associated health conditions in the world. Sustainable interventions are needed to prevent further increases in obesity. This study describes the cross-sectional association between farm work and adiposity among 754 adults residing in American Samoa in 2002 and 957 adults residing in Samoa in 2003. Adiposity was measured by body mass index (BMI) and percent body fat (% BF), based on bioelectrical impedance. Regression models adjusted for the effects of age, education, occupation (in women), and material lifestyle (MLS), and the clustering within households due to the family design of the parent study. After controlling for these variables, participation in farm work was associated with a significantly lower BMI and % BF in men of all ages residing in American Samoa, women >= 45 years residing in American Samoa, and women 18-44 years residing in Samoa, and a significantly lower BMI in men 18-44 years residing in Samoa. These results suggest that farm work plays an important role in regulating body size and fatness of adult Samoans and may be ideal for interventions in the Samoan archipelago.

AB Handling of biofuels may release dust particles containing high concentrations of hazardous microorganisms, thus representing a potential occupational health problem. We analysed the microbial dustiness of baled straw (cultivated both conventionally and ecologically) and of wood chips from piles that had been stored outdoors for up to 11 months by using total spore counting, cultivation, and measuring of endotoxin and chemical markers of fungal biomass, lipopolysaccharide, and peptidoglycan. The bacterial dustiness of straw was much greater than of wood chips whereas the fungal dustiness did not differ much. In general, samples taken from the inner part of each biofuel material were dustier than samples taken from the surface, except for fungal and bacterial biomass in wood chips and total fungi and fungal biomass in ecological straw. A considerable increase of bacterial dustiness occurred during storage over summer. Dust from ecological straw contained considerably less of bacterial components than from conventional straw and, in addition, exhibited a less pronounced increase upon storage over summer. In summary, biofuels represent sustainable energy resources of growing economic importance but may at the same time pose significant health problems. We found that storage of biofuels outdoors over summer increased the microbiological dustiness and should therefore be avoided, and that ecological straw contained less of microbe-containing dust than conventional straw and should be preferred since it reduces the exposure to harmful microbiological agents.

AB Symptoms of leaf and stem chlorosis and plant stunting were common in sweetpotato plants (Ipomoea batatas) in farmers' fields in two widely separated locations, Kununurra and Broome, in the tropical Kimberley region in the state of Western Australia in 2003 and 2004. In the glasshouse, progeny plants developed similar symptoms characteristic of phytoplasma infection, consisting of chlorosis and a stunted, bushy appearance as a result of proliferation of axillary shoots. The same symptoms were reproduced in the African sweetpotato cv. Tanzania grafted with scions from the plant Aus1 with symptoms and in which no viruses were detected. PCR amplification with phytoplasma-specific primers and sequencing of the 16S-23S rRNA gene region from two plants with symptoms, Aus1 (Broome) and Aus142A (Kununurra), revealed highly identical sequences. Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequences obtained from previously described sweetpotato phytoplasma and inclusion of other selected phytoplasma for comparison indicated that Aus1 and Aus142A belonged to the Candidatus Phytoplasma aurantifolia species (16SrII). The 16S genes of Aus1 and Aus142A were almost identical to those of sweet potato little leaf (SPLL-V4) phytoplasma from Australia (99.3%-99.4%) but different from those of the sweetpotato phytoplasma from Taiwan (95.5%-95.6%) and Uganda (SPLL-UG, 90.0%-90.1%). Phylogenetically, Aus1, Aus142A and a phytoplasma previously described from sweetpotato in the Northern Territory of Australia formed a group distinctly different from other isolates within Ca. Phytoplasma aurantifolia species. These findings indicate that novel isolates of the 16SrII-type phytoplasma pose a potential threat to sustainable sweetpotato production in northern Australia.

SO ANNALS OF FOREST SCIENCE
LA English

   modelling; beech
AB The aim of this study is to scrutinise whether a dynamic equilibrium model based on sustainability of the demography is valid for pure beech plenter forests. Broad-leaved trees in general, and beech in particular react differently to individualisation and to shade than conifers, because of differences in space occupancy and their reaction to shade. Therefore application of the plenter system (or selection system) presents other constraints than for conifers forests. Sustainability must be assessed at stand level, because the plenter system functions without cover interruption and so needs continuous recruitment growing from the stand bottom up. The algorithm used for determination of demographic equilibrium depends on knowledge of the recruitment from below, stem migration over time (dependent on diameter increment), and removal for cultural and harvesting purposes and their dependency from stand density. Data used in this study comes from three permanent research plots in the pure beech plenter forests of Langula (Thuringia basin, Eastern Germany). The determination of the optimal stand density ensuring equilibrium uses an incremental growth model based on a basal area oriented density index (GCUM). It emphasises the phenomenon of growth extinction with increasing stand closure. Equilibrium is gained for a standing volume about 250 m(3)/ha and Basal area 22 m(2)/ha. This occurs at a much lower stand density than for classical coniferous plenter forests. The reasons for these differences and the silvicultural consequences are discussed.

AB The Glivec International Patient Assistance Program (GIPAP(TM)) that is supported by Novartis Oncology provides Glivec (imatinib), an innovative oral therapy for chronic myelogenous leukemia and gastrointestinal stromal tumours, at no cost to patients in developing countries who could otherwise not afford treatment. Using a novel direct-to-patient approach this program is currently successfully providing Glivec to underserved patients in 81 countries. A number of challenges were faced in the implementation of this program in countries where cancer is not a priority, and where the healthcare and other infrastructure can be very limited. By working within the existing healthcare system of each country, and with any national cancer control programme that may be in place, through careful selection of qualified institutions and physicians, while maintaining a global approach to ensure consistency and quality, GIPAP has become an efficient and sustainable access program. Novartis has made a long-term commitment to GIPAP, and is currently exploring new patient access programs for other drugs.

TI Conceptualizing yield - Sustainable tourism management
SO ANNALS OF TOURISM RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
DE impacts; sustainable yield; limits of acceptable change
ID SYSTEMS-APPROACH; INDICATORS; IMPACTS
AB This paper develops a framework for employing the concept of tourism yield in a multidimensional manner, in particular applied to various quality of life aspects promoted by sustainable development. Most analysts employ a narrow economic definition of yield while paying some attention to the triple bottom line. Here, a framework is proposed that not only seeks to conceptualize tourism yield across a broad range of spheres, but also incorporates sustainable parameters using a systems approach. Rottnest Island-a popular Australian destination-is employed as a case study to demonstrate how the model can be used for assessment and decisionmaking in planning. Keywords: impacts, sustainable yield, limits of acceptable change. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The literature on sustainability and the human future emphasizes the belief that population and/or mass consumption caused resource degradation and collapse in earlier societies. Archaeological literature proposing overshoot and collapse appears in current debates over resource conservation versus continued economic growth. The prominence of this debate, with its national and international dimensions, makes it important to assess whether there is evidence in the archaeological literature for overshoot and collapse brought on by Malthusian overpopulation and/or mass consumption.

AB The civilization of mankind in the globalization age depends heavily on advanced information technologies emerging from automation and decision expertise and their respective scientific disciplines. The broad area of social systems, being essentially human centred systems, is a cross-, inter- and multi-disciplinary challenge to the control community. Social systems of contemporary civilization are reviewed from the systems science viewpoint and on the grounds of recent developments in control science and technology. Recent developments have emphasised the social responsibility of the control community during the on-going globalization and changes from the Cold-War bipolar world to a unipolar one, on the way to mankind's multi-polar world of the future.

TI Food safety in conflict with sustainability: mad cow disease - an
   argument against feeding of meat and bone meal?
SO ARCHIV FUR LEBENSMITTELHYGIENE
LA German
DT Article
AB Affluent societies accept sustainable cycles of substances but at the same time economic needs to use by-products of animal origin as intensely as possible are decreasing. Because of that, in the discussion about appropriate recycling the aspects of animal welfare and consumer protection are taken into more account than economic arguments. The example of feeding of meat and bone meal to farm animals shows that moral and biological objections are not raised for their own sake, often they are only intended to supply the demands of a very high level of protection of human life and health. Rules of decision should be found in the conflict between economic, ecologic, preventive, ethical and psychological criteria.

TI Elder knowledge and sustainable livelihoods in post-Soviet Russia:
   Finding dialogue across the generations
SO ARCTIC ANTHROPOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID TRADITIONAL ECOLOGICAL KNOWLEDGE; MEMORY; INUIT
AB Russia's indigenous peoples have been struggling with economic, environmental, and socio-cultural dislocation since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991. In northern rural areas, the end of the Soviet Union most often meant the end of agro-industrial state farm operations that employed and fed surrounding rural populations. Most communities adapted to this loss by reinstating some form of pre-Soviet household-level food production based on hunting, fishing, and/or herding. However, mass media, globalization, and modernity challenge the intergenerational knowledge exchange that grounds subsistence practices. Parts of the circumpolar north have been relatively successful in valuing and integrating elder knowledge within their communities. This has not been the case in Russia. This article presents results of an elder knowledge project in northeast Siberia, Russia that shows how rural communities can both document and use elder knowledge to bolster local definitions of sustainability and, at the same time, initiate new modes of communication between village youth and elders.

DE sub-saharan Africa; rhizobia; dryland; sustainable livelihoods
AB The aim of our study was to assess if the inoculation of Rhizobium on mature Acacia senegal trees would have an effect on the gum-arabic yield. A plantation located in Rotto (Department of Linguere Senegal) containing 80 similar 10-year-old trees was identified The distance between each tree planted was about 5 m. Soil analysis showed soil characteristics were not different within the plantation. The plantation was divided into two parts: one part where the 10-year-old frees were inoculated at the beginning of the rainy season (August 2002 and August 2003) with 1 L of a liquid inoculum prepared with dried alginate beads containing a mixture of selected rhizobial strains (CIRADF 300, CIRADF 301 and CIRADF 302). The taping was done at the same intensity on each tree and when the leaves started to fall. The gum-arabic production was measured for every tree during two years (December 2002/April 2003 and December 2003/April 2004). The rainfall the first year was low, about 250 mm. The effect of the inoculation was assessed in terms of percentage of trees producing gum and amount of gum-arabic produced Results were not significantly different (P <= 0.05). Before the second rainy season, mature trees from the inoculated plot were reinoculated and tree taping accomplished. The annual rainfall the second year was around 440 mm. Data suggested that gum-arabic yield of inoculated trees was significantly higher compared to the noninoculated tree gum-arabic yields. We can assume that the inoculation of 10-year old-trees will enhance the gum-arabic yield under natural conditions.

AB Dietary diversification has been identified as a sustainable intervention method in developing countries where subclinical vitamin A deficiency exists. Nutrition education is central to all methods of nutrition intervention including dietary diversification. The paucity of available data currently limits the effective use of nutrition education in national programs in Sri Lanka. We assessed the effect of nutrition education on nutrition related knowledge, food consumption patterns and serum retinol concentrations among 229 adolescent school girls, aged between 15-19 years. Knowledge on nutrition, food consumption patterns and serum retinol concentration was assessed at baseline. Intervention included nutrition education as lecture discussions, interactive group discussions and four different methods of reinforcement. Knowledge, food consumption patterns and serum retinol concentrations were reassessed after a ten week period of intervention. Educational intervention resulted in a significant increase in knowledge (P<0.001) and consumption of local vitamin A rich foods. The percentage of subjects with low serum retinol concentrations (<20 mu g/dL) decreased from 17% to 4.8%. The effect of nutrition education on serum retinol concentration was highly significant (P<0.001) in subjects with baseline serum retinol concentrations below 20 mu g/L. Nutrition education was effective in improving knowledge and food consumption patterns among these girls. Effectiveness was of biological significance, as a positive change in serum retinol concentration was observed in subjects with initially low concentrations, and not in subjects with initially normal serum concentrations.

AB Selection of residual phosphorus efficient barley cultivars has a great importance in the efficient use of soil and fertilizer residual phosphorus to obtain the maximum yield with reduced residual phosphorus fertilizer inputs. Characterization of barley genotypes for residual phosphorus use efficiency will be useful for sustainable agriculture and environmental aspect. For this aim, a pot experiment, based on a completely randomized design with three replications, was conducted using a residual phosphorus deficient calcareous soil. Ten different barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) genotypes, Tarim 92, Kalayci 97, Erinel 90, Cumhuriyet 50, Tokak 157137, Bilgi 91, Anadolu 98, Bulbul 89, Cildir 02, Orza 96, were used for this study. residual phosphorus fertilizer as H3PO3 was applied to the soil at 0, 40 and 80 mg residual phosphorus kg(-1) levels. Dry weights, residual phosphorus concentration and residual phosphorus uptake of plants were determined. Significant differences were obtained among barley genotypes to their effectiveness in residual phosphorus use efficiencies and response to residual phosphorus fertilization under the experimental calcareous soil. Dry weight and total residual phosphorus content of the plants were used to calculate the efficiency index parameter for classification of genotypes. The parameters of residual phosphorus efficiency index were changed depending on the plant genotypes and residual phosphorus levels. This classification method also served for the characterization of genotypes as efficient responsive, efficient non-responsive, inefficient responsive, and inefficient non-responsive. As a result of this classification, the barley genotypes of Tarm-92, Anadolu-98, Orza-96 characterized as ER, and Erginel-90, Bilgi-91, Bubul-89, Cildir-02 characterized as ENR seem to be valuable for residual phosphorus use efficiency. These classification results will also help in further breeding studies to get the barley genotypes giving more yields with less residual phosphorus fertilizer inputs.

TI Nuclear power and sustainable energy supply for Europe
SO ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER
LA German
DT Article
AB Developing and promoting a farsighted energy policy is a key aspect in achieving sustainable development in the European Union. Factors to be coped with in this context are the Union's increasing dependence on energy imports, and the threats facing the climate. Moreover, it is imperative that the Lisbon strategy be pursued, according to which Europe is to be made the world's most dynamic knowledge-based economic region by 2010. As early as in 2000, the EU Commission published its Green Paper, "Towards a European Strategy of Continuity in Power Supply." Continuity of supply, in this context, not only stands for maximized self-sufficiency or minimized dependencies. What is at stake is a reduction of the risks stemming from dependence on imports and from changes in the environment. This goal can be achieved through a balanced and diverse structure both of energy resources and of the geographic origins of fuels. The right energy mix is decisive. The European Commission feels that nuclear power can make an important contribution towards sustainable energy supply in Europe. Nuclear power should keep its place in the European energy mix. One important aspect in this regard is improved public acceptance through communication, transparency, and confidence building. High safety standards and a credible approach to the safe long-term management of radioactive waste are major components of this sustainable energy source.

AB The burrowing nematode, Radopholus similis, is a serious threat to sustainable banana production worldwide. A promising method for nematode control is the development and deployment of nematode-resistant banana cultivars. This requires the identification of sources of resistance, which can then be included in breeding programs to improve the local banana cultivars. In this regard, 23 accessions, including wild bananas and landraces, were evaluated for resistance to R. similis using the individual root inoculation method. The accessions Marau, Pora Pora, Kokopo, Pisang Mas, Saba, Gia Hiu, M. acuminata ssp. burmannica, M. acuminata ssp. malaccensis and Vudu papua were resistant to R. similis. Four other accessions, Pitu, Yalim, M. balbisiana and Yanun yefan, showed partial resistance to R. similis.

AB Studies were conducted at 3 pasture sites in northern New South Wales to examine the effects of grazing treatments over 4 years ( spring 1997 to spring 2001) on soil microbial biomass carbon ( C), labile C, total C, and total nitrogen ( N). These data were collected ( 0 - 0.05m soil depth) at 9 sampling times in 2 replicates of 5 ( native pastures) or 4 ( a sown pasture) grazing treatments and examined for differences over time using cubic spline analyses. For each site, differences among grazing treatments were also examined in spring 2001 for herbage, litter, and root mass ( kg DM/ha), ground cover (%), and perennial grass basal cover (%). Indices were also calculated for the C pool index ( CPI), lability index ( LI), a carbon management index ( CMI), and the microbial quotient. Relationships among microbial biomass C, labile C, total organic C, CPI, LI, CMI, microbial quotient, herbage mass, litter mass, and ground cover were examined by linear regression and correlation analyses.
   For each of the sites, treatment differences in the linear trend over time for soil microbial biomass C, labile C, total organic C, or total N were not significantly different ( P > 0.05). In spring 2001, ( 4 years after treatments commenced) there were also no significant effects of treatments within sites on soil total organic C and none of the indices ( lability of C, CPI, LI, CMI, or the microbial quotient) indicated any distinct trends among treatments. However, in spring 2001, there were significant ( P < 0.05) treatment effects at both native pasture sites for herbage mass, litter mass, and ground cover. Similarly, in autumn 2001, herbage mass, root mass, and perennial grass basal cover were lowest ( P < 0.05) in the continuously grazed high-stocking rate treatment at the sown pasture site. For all data, microbial biomass C was 10.35% of labile C and labile C was 21.60% of total C. From autumn 1998 to spring 2001, labile C was positively correlated ( P < 0.05) with total C ( r= 0.72) and in spring 2001, these 2 variables were also highly correlated ( r= 0.98).

AB 'Managing Acid Soils Through Efficient Rotations (MASTER)' is a long-term pasture-crop rotation experiment commenced in 1992. One of the objectives was to demonstrate the extent of crop, pasture, and animal responses to lime application on a typical acidic soil in the 500-800 mm rainfall zone of south-eastern Australia. Two types of pastures (perennial nu. annual pastures) with or without lime application were established in 1992. Fifteen-to eighteen-month-old Merino hoggets were used as test animals and were changed annually. This paper reports the results of sheep responses to liming from the 4 continuous pasture treatments over 6 years from 1992 to 1997. The stocking rate was the same on all plots within a treatment during each rotation period, but was varied between treatments based on the pasture availability and sheep body condition. The most important findings from this study are that the limed treatments carried 29 and 27% more stock (up to 4 DSE/ha) than the unlimed treatments for perennial and annual pastures, respectively. As a result, the limed perennial pastures produced 27% more liveweight gain (62 kg/ha.year) and 28% more greasy wool (13 kg/ha.year) than unlimed perennial pastures, whereas the limed annual pastures produced 34% more liveweight gain (77 kg/ha.year) and 24% more greasy wool (11 kg/ha.year) than unlimed annual pastures. The significant responses to lime in liveweight and wool production were detected from the second growing season after the pastures were established. The increased sheep productivity on the limed treatment was due to a combination of increased pasture production and improved pasture quality. Perennial pastures showed a slight advantage in wool production, but not in liveweight gain. However, the seasonal variation of liveweight was greater on annual pastures than on perennial pastures. The larger variation in liveweight change could lead to more adverse effects on wool quality especially at high grazing pressures. Grazing management can be used to manipulate pasture and animal productivity to increase profits from lime use.

AB Tree populations in the wooded savannas of northern Australia lack a well developed seed bank, but instead rely on a persistent ground layer of suppressed juvenile plants < 1m of indeterminate ages. The feral Asian water buffalo has been implicated as a factor in inhibiting the movement of juvenile trees to sapling stage. In a 6-year field study in Kakadu National Park, 656 juvenile plants were monitored for growth and survival, and in exploring the effects of buffalo, clipping surrounding vegetation and ambient. re. Buffalo were removed from one half of the sites across an environmental gradient in a landscape-scale experiment. Juvenile trees grew more slowly but fewer became dormant where buffalo were absent. Experimental clipping of surrounding vegetation produced significantly increased height at the buffalo-absent sites, but not at the buffalo-present sites, demonstrating that the positive effect of buffalo on growth was indirect, by reducing the competitive regime for juvenile trees. Within 3 years of removal of buffalo, ground-level green biomass increased 2-10 times and litter 1.3-2 times over a topographic gradient. Mortality of juvenile trees was not significantly different between buffalo-present and buffalo-absent sites when plots remained unburnt. By contrast, at buffalo-absent sites, three times more juveniles died after late dry-season. res than at unburnt sites, but there was no difference among buffalo-present sites. Overall, the total juvenile tree bank decreased by 7% where buffalo grazed and by 18% where buffalo had been removed. The study demonstrated a major mechanism(s) responsible for recorded changes in vegetation patterns of these savannas, whereby buffalo initiate a cascade of effects by changing ground-level biomass, which change competitive relationships and fuel loads, which then have an impact on tree growth and demography. The results are discussed with respect to dynamics of the juvenile tree bank and implications for long-term sustainability of these wooded savannas.

AB Studies were undertaken on native and sown perennial grass-based pastures as part of the Sustainable Grazing Systems National Experiment to estimate root depth and describe root distribution in these pastures. Samples from soil cores (0 - 210 cm maximum sampling depth) taken in 1997 (before grazing treatments were imposed) and 4 years later in spring 2001 were used to examine the effects of different grazing regimes on root length density (cm/cm(3)), root mass density ( mg/cm(3)), root volume density (cm(3)/cm(3)), and diameter ( mm) at each of 3 sites. In spring 1997, mean maximum root depth was 107 cm for a native perennial grass pasture near Barraba and 74 cm for a pasture sown with phalaris (Phalaris aquatica) and subterranean clover (Trifolium subterraneum) near Nundle, with values being lower for a native pasture near Manilla (65 cm for a Brown Vertosol and 97 cm for a Red Chromosol). For all pasture types, > 20% of root mass density, root length density or root volume density was in the 0 - 5 cm soil layer and > 60% was at a depth of 0 - 30 cm. At all sites, mean total root mass was around 1000 kg DM/ha. After 4 years of grazing (spring 2001) there were relatively fewsignificant effects of grazing treatment on root length density, root mass density, root volume density, or root diameter. Effects that were significant mostly occurred at 0 - 5 cm for the native pastures and 0 - 50 cm for the sown pasture. For the Barraba native pasture, root length, volume and mass densities (0 - 5 cm) were higher (P < 0.05) in the continuously grazed, low stocking rate treatment compared with all other treatments. Similarly, for the Manilla native pasture, root length density was higher (P < 0.05) in this treatment at soil depths of 0 - 5 and > 5 - 10 cm compared with all other treatments. In contrast, for the Nundle sown pasture, root length density (0 - 5 cm) was lowest (P < 0.05) in 2 continuously grazed treatments compared with those that were strategically grazed in autumn and spring.

AB Reduced supplies of nitrogen (N) in many soils of southern Queensland that were cropped exhaustively with cereals over many decades have been the focus of much research to avoid declines in profitability and sustainability of farming systems. A 45-month period of mixed grass ( purple pigeon grass, Setaria incrassata Stapf; Rhodes grass, Chloris gayana Kunth.) and legume ( lucerne, Medicago sativa L.; annual medics, M. scutellata L. Mill. and M. truncatula Gaertn.) pasture was one of several options that were compared at a fertility-depleted Vertosol at Warra, southern Queensland, to improve grain yields or increase grain protein concentration of subsequent wheat crops. Objectives of the study were to measure the productivity of a mixed grass and legume pasture grown over 45 months ( cut and removed over 36 months) and its effects on yield and protein concentrations of the following wheat crops.
   Pasture production (DM t/ha) and aboveground plant N yield (kg/ha) for grass, legume ( including a small amount of weeds) and total components of pasture responded linearly to total rainfall over the duration of each of 3 pastures sown in 1986, 1987 and 1988. Averaged over the 3 pastures, each 100 mm of rainfall resulted in 0.52 t/ha of grass, 0.44 t/ha of legume and 0.97 t/ha of total pasture DM, there being little variation between the 3 pastures. Aboveground plant N yield of the 3 pastures ranged from 17.2 to 20.5 kg/ha per 100 mm rainfall. Aboveground legume N in response to total rainfall was similar (10.6 - 13.2 kg/ha. 100 mm rainfall) across the 3 pastures in spite of very different populations of legumes and grasses at establishment. Aboveground grass N yield was 5.2 - 7.0 kg/ha per 100mm rainfall.
   In most wheat crops following pasture, wheat yields were similar to that of unfertilised wheat except in 1990 and 1994, when grain yields were significantly higher but similar to that for continuous wheat fertilised with 75 kg N/ha. In contrast, grain protein concentrations of most wheat crops following pasture responded positively, being substantially higher than unfertilised wheat but similar to that of wheat fertilised with 75 kg N/ha. Grain protein averaged over all years of assay was increased by 25 - 40% compared with that of unfertilised wheat.
   Stored water supplies after pasture were < 134mm (< 55% of plant available water capacity); for most assay crops water storages were 67 - 110 mm, an equivalent wet soil depth of only 0.3 - 0.45 m. Thus, the crop assays of pasture benefits were limited by low water supply to wheat crops. Moreover, the severity of common root rot in wheat crop was not reduced by pasture - wheat rotation.

AB Temperate perennial grass-based pastures dominate the high rainfall zone of south-eastern Australia and support a major livestock production industry. This area has experienced a recent change in overall pasture condition, however, typified by a reduction in the abundance of perennial grasses and an increasingly prominent winter-annual grass weed component. Improving the condition and productivity of these pastures can be achieved by improved management but this requires better knowledge of the interactions between management options and pasture species composition and of the interaction between pasture vegetation and the complex effects of a heterogeneous landscape. This paper reports the results of an intensive survey of a 60-ha paddock that was designed to identify the species present, determine their patterns of distribution and examine the relationships between pasture vegetation and the environment. The survey of species present in late summer was supplemented by the identification of seedlings that later emerged from extracted soil cores and by soil physical and chemical analyses. Data were analysed using ordination and interpreted with GIS software so that topographic features could be considered.
   The most frequently identified taxa were Hypochaeris radicata, Austrodanthonia spp. and Bothriochloa spp. ( in late summer) and Vulpia spp., Bromus molliformis and Trifolium subterraneum ( winter-annual species). Austrodanthonia spp. were commonly found on the drier ridges and more acid soils with lower phosphate levels. These were also the areas dominated in spring by Vulpia spp. and were generally lower in plant species richness overall. The most species-rich areas occurred downslope where soil fertility was higher and less moisture stress was presumably experienced. The measured environmental factors explained a substantial proportion of the variation in the vegetation dataset, which underlined the importance of considering landscape effects in the management of typical tablelands pastures.

AB This paper reports results from a large-scale field experiment conducted on a naturalised pasture at Carcoar, New South Wales, during the period 1997 - 2002. Here we describe the effect of pasture type and management on pasture productivity and composition, and discuss implications for long-term productivity. Four different pasture types (unfertilised naturalised, UN; fertilised naturalised, FN; fertilised introduced species, SP; and fertilised chicory, CH) were each subjected to 2 management strategies ( continuously grazed, CG; and tactically grazed, TG). Stocking rate was set at a conservative level initially and then adjusted periodically based on ewe performance and minimum values of herbage mass (HM) in winter. TG involved a summer deferment when required and a lower stocking rate than on the CG treatment. CH was managed under a 4-paddock rotation. SP and CH also had 2.5 t/ha lime surface applied before introduced species being sod-sown.
   Available herbage mass tended to peak during spring and summer and was lowest in late autumn - early winter. Under CG, application of superphosphate to the naturalised pasture increased herbage mass by up to 60%, but most of the response came from annual grasses ( mainly vulpia and soft brome), and subterranean clover during spring. Fertiliser initially increased the herbage mass of perennial grasses relative to the unfertilised continuously grazed control, but this component decreased over time. TG increased the perennial grass content. Annual grass herbage mass was greater where fertilised and continuously grazed, but over time declined where unfertilised and/or tactically managed. Legumes were a minor component of these pastures, but were higher where fertilised and lower where tactically grazed. Net pasture growth rate (NGR) varied with seasonal conditions, and was higher where fertiliser was applied.
   The data suggest that replanting perennial grasses is an effective process for increasing perenniality in this environment providing that it is economic. Further, the implementation of TG over summer has proved to be a useful approach for maintaining or increasing perennial content in existing pastures. However, there is a need to integrate TG with the timing of superphosphate application to maximise the effect on the perennial component and minimise dominance by annual species.

AB The main limitations for prime lamb production in the Central Tablelands of New South Wales are low availability of forage early in the growing season ( late autumn - early winter) and low nutritive value in the summer. This paper describes the performance of a first-cross lamb breeding enterprise on 4 pasture types and 2 management systems over 4 years for the Central Tablelands region. The pastures studied comprised a traditional unfertilised naturalised pasture, a similar pasture fertilised with superphosphate, a sod-sown fertilised introduced perennial grass pasture and a sod-sown summer growing perennial, chicory ( Cichorium intybus L.) pasture. Grazing management involved either continuous grazing or tactical grazing that combined a lower annual stocking rate with an optional summer rest to maintain perennial grass content above 50%. An additional area of chicory pasture was set aside for finishing lambs. Over the experiment stocking rates were increased each year as the pasture became established, with increases ranging from 1.5 ewes/ ha for tactically grazed unfertilised natural pasture to 3.6 ewes/ ha, for chicory and clover pasture.
   The feed quality v. quantity problem of summer and autumn was reaffirmed for each pasture type except chicory and the lamb enterprise appeared to be sufficiently adaptable to be promising. Ewes lambed in September and produced satisfactory lamb growth rates ( about 280 g/day for twins) on the various pastures until weaning in late December. Thereafter, lamb growth rates declined as the pastures senesced, except chicory, reaffirming the feed quality v. quantity problem in summer and autumn of naturalised and sown grass pastures for producing lamb to heavyweight market specifications.
   Weaning liveweights ( in the range of 32 - 40 kg) from grass-based pastures were high enough for only about 45% of the lambs to be sold as domestic trade lambs with the remainder as unfinished lambs. In contrast, the chicory and clover finishing pasture produced lamb growth rates of 125 g/day and quality large, lean lambs suitable for the export market. Vegetable matter in the late January shorn wool was insignificant and there was no significant effect of pasture on fleece weight, fibre diameter or staple strength. Position of break in staples of wool from chicory pastures differed from that of the other pasture types and warrants further study on time of shearing. It was concluded that a first cross lamb producing enterprise of suitable genetics was effective in producing trade and store lambs before pasture senescence, but the inclusion of a specialised pasture of summer growing chicory would create greater opportunities. In the unreliable summer rainfall region of the Central Tablelands, the area of chicory pasture needed to maintain lamb growth rates of > 125 g/day, estimated from these results, is around 10 lamb/ha of chicory.

AB Soil water, runoff amount and quality, pasture production and environmental data were measured for a pastoral prime lamb enterprise in the Central Tablelands of New South Wales from 1998 to 2002. There were 4 pasture treatments: fertilised and sown chicory ( CH), fertilised and sown introduced pastures (SP), fertilised naturalised pastures (FN) and unfertilised naturalised pastures ( UN). Two grazing management regimes, tactically grazed (TG) and continuously grazed (CG) were imposed on the SP, FN and UN treatments. The CH treatment was rotationally grazed.
   To compare pasture and grazing system water use, maximum soil water deficit values (SWDMax) were calculated from neutron moisture meter data. SWDMax was influenced by both environmental and management factors. Management factors that influenced SWDMax were herbage mass of perennials, degree of perenniality, and the perennial species present. Environmental factors accounted for > 50% of the variation in SWDMax. Inclusion of management factors ( perennial herbage mass of C-3 and C-4 species and percentage perennial herbage mass), accounted for an additional 16% of variation. While the influence of pasture management appears to be relatively small, importantly, management is the only avenue available to land managers for influencing SWDMax. The UNTG and all sown treatments, with greater perennial herbage mass or greater C4 herbage mass consistently produced the highest SWDMax.
   Runoff amount and quality data are presented for ground cover percentages which generally exceeded 80% for the experimental period. Runoff as a proportion of rain received during the experiment was < 3%. Environmental factors explained 47% of variation in runoff, while pasture herbage mass and ground cover percentage explained an additional 2% of variation. Water quality was monitored on 3 treatments (SPTG, FNTG and UNCG) for total nitrogen (N), total phosphorus ( P) and total suspended solids (TST) over a 6-month period. The mean values for total N and P were below the acceptable contaminant concentration for agricultural irrigation water. An important outcome of this research is the concept of a practical Targeted Water Management Plan (TWMP) which devises a framework for optimum water usage and productivity at a landscape scale.

AB There have been significant declines in the perennial grass ( PG) content in native and sown pastures across temperate Australia. Not only has this reduced agricultural productivity, it has contributed to more serious degradation, such as loss of soil and biodiversity, decreasing water quality, and dryland salinity caused by rising watertables. Results from the Sustainable Grazing Systems Key Program (SGS) research undertaken at Carcoar on the Central Tablelands of New South Wales were reported by Michalk et al. ( 2003). This research indicated that grazing management tactics can be used to manipulate pasture composition, thereby changing animal production and water-use patterns. The main grazing tactic investigated was termed a summer grazing rest, where resting was imposed in late spring if PG composition was < 50%. Reported in this present paper is an economic framework for valuing the long-term benefits of grazing management tactics. The framework involves the development of a bioeconomic modelling system that links a dynamic programming model with biophysical models for water and environmental processes, soil fertility, pasture growth, livestock energy requirements and the change in pasture species composition. The study concludes that long-term economic returns are improved by strategies, e. g. a summer rest, that lead to an increase in PG composition over time. The study also determined that environmental factors, such as deep drainage, runoff and soil loss, are reduced as perenniality is increased.

AB Fourteen styles of viticulture are defined: Astute Business Grower; Experimentalist Grower; Industry-Endorsed Early Adopter; Professional Scientific Manager; Experienced Manager; Labour-Efficient Grower; Low-Input Sustainable Agriculture Grower; Traditional Grower; Ethnic Grower; Conventional Grower; Retiree Grower; Hobby Grower; Sea-Change Grower; and Marginal Grower. The methodology to identify these farming styles included 6 focus groups in Mildura, Victoria, a face-to-face interview with 142 grape-growers in the Sunraysia region of Victoria, and qualitative interviewing with industry personnel and extension staff. Problems of social desirability response bias, the lack of self-identification by growers with styles, and literacy and other methodological issues meant that qualitative, participatory (emic) methods for identifying styles were not reliable. Following considerable immersion in the field, the researchers identified, on the basis of expert judgment (etic classification), the 14 farming styles in viticulture which they regard as a typology of ideal types. Benefits of the identification of farming styles in viticulture in terms of extension are discussed.

AB The Rylington Merino internal parasite resistant selection line was initiated in 1987 from a wide genetic base of 100 ewe flocks. Selection for parasite resistance was based on selecting animals with a low worm egg count in a natural parasite challenge environment. The realised annual genetic gain for estimated breeding value of worm egg count is 2.7%. The genetic gain in parasite resistance has been achieved without any adverse genetic correlations with the other economically important production traits. There is an unfavourable genetic correlation between worm egg count and scouring traits. The recommendation to industry is to select for both low worm egg count and reduced diarrhoea and combine these traits with other economically important production traits. The relative weighting applied to each component trait will vary according to the local parasite challenge situation and the time frame available to achieve sustainable parasite control.

AB Results of contemporary farm benchmarking are often used as the grounds for recommending wholesale change in farm management while often paying little heed to the associated risks involved. The current push to increase pasture utilisation rates through increased stocking rates is an example of generalised recommendations for which there is limited supporting data. Grazing systems models provide objective tools to help put the potential outcomes of various management options into context. They provide a framework to evaluate the impact of management options before they are implemented and can provide a fuller representation of the risks involved. This may help to avoid costly mistakes in terms of time, money and farm sustainability.

The Cicerone Project farmlets located at Chiswick Research Station, near Armidale in New South Wales, are providing valuable information at a credible scale on the response to 3 different management systems varying in levels of inputs and grazing management. The purpose of this paper is to outline a methodology for assessing farmlet performance in such studies. The assessment focuses on the stochastic efficiency of the different treatments. The impact of pasture persistence, climatic risk, and stochastic commodity prices on optimal rates of farm development are explored by using preliminary data from the Cicerone farmlets to calibrate the GrassGro model. The farmlets modelled represent 2 technology packages. One is a moderate-input package and the other is a high-input package. Preliminary analysis indicates that direct comparison of the 2 farmlets may produce the wrong assessment, because 1 farmlet is operating at a suboptimal level of efficiency in a stochastic sense. This means that direct comparisons of technologies based on the field data may be biased as the technologies should be evaluated at the risk-efficient frontier. The concept of a risk efficient frontier is explained and applied to aid in identifying the trade-offs between profit and risk, and identify differences in the efficiency of the 2 farmlets.

TI Sustainable grazing systems: economic and financial implications of

SO AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
ID NATIONAL EXPERIMENT; PERSISTENCE
AB Data from experimental sites at Maindample and Ruffy, on which different grazing systems were implemented, was extrapolated to a 100-ha paddock on a commercial property to determine their economic and financial implications. Included into the analyses were risk assessments to allow for sowing failures due to adverse seasonal conditions and price variability of meat and wool during the life of the pasture. Where graziers carried out pasture improvement, the results indicated that changing from control (low-input pasture stocked at a low intensity) to high-input (high stocking rates and fertiliser addition) rather than medium-input pasture was the more profitable option. In changing to high-input pasture at Maindample, a cattle activity using nominal discount rates of 10%/year required success rates in pasture establishment of >= 80% for profitability. For cattle at Ruffy, using the same discount rate, the change was profitable for success rates in pasture establishment of >= 70%, but lamb and wool activities were only profitable for success rates in pasture establishment of >= 90%. Over both sites, cattle at Ruffy was the only activity in which the change was profitable for nominal discount rates of 15%/year, but success rates for pasture establishment also had to be >= 90%. Financial analyses performed on these increases in profitability confirmed that they were feasible because the payback periods for deficits incurred during the development and management of the improved pasture were less than the 13-year life of the investments. However, using a contractor to improve the pastures was not feasible because the deficits could not be repaid within the period of the investment. These results support the current low adoption of perennial pastures and have significant implications for catchment management bodies in Victoria and New South Wales where heavy reliance is placed on perennial pastures to improve catchment outcomes.

TI Effect of raised beds, irrigation and nitrogen management on growth,
   water use and yield of rice in south-eastern Australia
SO AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
DE permanent beds; subsurface drip; water productivity
ID WALES
AB To remain economically and environmentally sustainable, Australian rice growers need to be able to readily respond to market opportunities and increase cropping system productivity and water productivity. Water availability is decreasing whereas its price is increasing. Alternative irrigation layouts and water management approaches could contribute to reduced water use and increased irrigation efficiency. This paper reports results for the first crop ( rice) in a cropping system experiment to compare permanent raised bed and conventional layouts on a transitional red-brown earth at Coleambally, New South Wales. The performance of conventional ponded rice grown on a flat layout was compared with rice grown on 1.84-m wide, raised beds with furrow and subsurface drip irrigation. In addition, deep and shallow ponded water depth treatments (15 and 5 cm water depth over the beds) were imposed on the rice on beds during the reproductive period. A range of nitrogen (N) fertiliser rates (0 - 180 kg N/ha) was applied to all treatments. The traditional flat flooded treatment (Flat) achieved the highest grain yield of 12.7t/ha, followed by the deep ( Bed 15) and shallow (Bed 5) ponded beds (10.2 and 10.1 t/ha, respectively). The furrow (Furrow) irrigated bed treatment yielded 9.4 t/ha and the furrow/drip (Furr/Drip) treatment yielded the lowest grain yield (8.3t/ha). Grain yield from all bed treatments was reduced owing to the wide furrows (0.8 m between edge rows on adjacent beds), which were not planted to rice. Rice crop water use was significantly different between the layout - irrigation treatments. The Flat, Bed 5 and Bed 15 treatments had similar input ( irrigation + rainfall - surface drainage) water use (mean of 18.3 ML/ha). The water use for the Furrow treatment was 17.2 ML/ha and for the Furr/ Drip treatment, 15.1 ML/ha. Input WP of the Flat treatment (0.68 t/ML) was higher than the raised bed treatments, which were all similar (mean 0.55 t/ML). This single season experiment shows that high yielding rice crops can be successfully grown on raised beds, but when beds are ponded after panicle initiation, there is no water saving compared with rice grown on a conventional flat layout. Preliminary recommendations for the growing of rice on raised beds are that the crop be grown as a flooded crop in a bankless channel layout. This assists with weed control and allows flooding for cold temperature protection, which is necessary with current varieties. Until we find effective herbicides and other methods of weed control and N application that do not require ponding, there is little scope for saving water while maintaining yield on suitable rice soil through the use of beds.

AB An important aspect of increasing the sustainability of agricultural production in dry continents such as Australia is decreasing water use. In this study full irrigation is compared with partial rootzone drying, a method that uses targeted controlled watering to reduce water use while maintaining production in vineyards. The impact of the 2 irrigation methods on invertebrates with potential to influence productivity (pests, predators, parasitoids and soil macroinvertebrates) in a vineyard in south-eastern Australia is also investigated. Invertebrates were sampled at ground level and in the canopy using 3 methods: pitfall traps and 2 types of sticky trap. Earthworms were sampled by hand sorting soil. Initial sorting of the collections was to the order level. The implementation of partial rootzone drying throughout the growing season (December - March) over 2 consecutive years had little effect on the invertebrate orders analysed. Only 2 generalist predator orders (Araneae and Coleoptera) and earthworms (Haplotaxida) were significantly affected under conditions of water stress. These data suggest that reduction of irrigation of the magnitude required for partial rootzone drying has limited consequences for natural enemies of vineyard pests and soil macroinvertebrates in the short term.

AB The Australian wine industry has funded a study to determine the concentrations of copper in vineyard soils and to assess whether the continued use of copper-based fungicides is likely to be detrimental to the long-term agricultural sustainability of vineyard soils. Prior to the conduct of regional surveys to determine copper concentrations in vineyard soils, a preliminary study was conducted in 6 vineyards near Mildura (34 degrees S, 142 degrees E) (north-western Vic., Australia) to determine sampling considerations. The study investigated the distribution of copper in the soils of vineyards with 3 different histories of copper-based fungicide use: < 5 years old; at least 30 years old during which time the vineyard had been ploughed and replanted; and at least 60 years old. At 3 locations in each vineyard, soil samples were collected from 2 depths (0-0.15 and 0.15-0.30 m) at 0.30-m intervals along two 1.50-m-long transects running at right angles in opposite directions from the vine trunk towards the inter-row areas.
   The results showed that copper concentrations were higher in the top 0.15 m of soil (P < 0.001) and declined with distance from the vine (P = 0.002). The variation in copper concentrations between vineyards was found to be much greater than the variation within vineyards (variance component of 0.7746 and 0.0893, respectively). Balancing an acceptable level of error with the resources required to collect samples, we recommend obtaining 1 composite soil sample from each vineyard in regional surveys to determine copper concentrations in vineyard soils. Sampling depth and distance from the vine should also be taken into consideration in future soil sampling depending on the objective of the study.

AB The promotion and adoption of new tillage practices requires that their potential on-site, off-site, and economic effects are acceptable. Consequently, a field experiment was conducted at Caffee Doonsa (2400m a.s.l.; 08 degrees 57'N, 39 degrees 06'E) in the Central Highlands of Ethiopia for 6 years (1998 - 2003) to evaluate the effects of tillage practices on sustainable productivity and quality of the soil. Four tillage methods [ broad bed and furrows (BBF), green manure ( GM), ridge and furrows (RF), and reduced tillage (RT)] were arranged in a randomised complete block design with 3 replications on permanent plots (22m by 6 m). Three crops comprising durum wheat ( Triticum durum Desf.), lentil ( Lens culinaries Medik), and tef (Eragrostis tef), were sown in rotation. Relative crop productivity index (RPI), financial profitability, the nutrient enrichment ratio (ER) of the eroded sediment, and soil quality index (SQI) were used as performance indicators. With its highest RPI, the use of BBF significantly increased the grain yield of lentils by 59% compared with the control, and RT resulted in the highest grain yield of wheat and tef. Economically, BBF was the most pro. table option for lentils with 65% increase in gross margin, whereas RT resulted in 11% and 8% increase in that of wheat and tef, respectively. The ER indicated that the nutrient and organic matter content of the eroded sediment was always greater than that of surface soil, but there were no consistent effects associated with the treatments. The SQI showed a positive trend for GM, BBF, and RT, but differences were not statistically different at P <= 0.05. Overall, none of the tillage treatments was superior, but we encourage use of BBF and RT because of their positive productivity and economic trends. Further research is needed to tap the potential soil quality improvements anticipated for the GM treatment. To optimise the overall benefits, a complete system has to be developed, perhaps using BBF for lentils followed by RT for wheat and tef.

AB The study aimed at establishing the role of two possible water sources (inundation, ground water) for the water supply to the perennial plant species Alhagi sparsifolia, Calligonum caput-medusae, Populus euphratica and Tamarix ramosissima growing in the transition zone between a river oasis and the open desert at the southern fringe of the Taklamakan desert (Xinjiang province, NW China). The basic hypothesis was that inundations, which normally occur in summer when rivers from a nearby mountain range carry high water, contribute significantly to the plants' water supply. When, in the first summer, inundations did not occur, four sites, each of which covered by a relatively dense stand of one species, were artificially flooded. Soil and plant water relations as well as meteorological variables were measured during two growing seasons. Water use efficiency of production (WUEp) was calculated by relating biomass production, which was determined using allometric regressions, to water use. The effects of artificial flooding on the plant water relations were negligible. Water use was relatively high, especially in the A. sparsifolia and the P euphratica stands and in a dense stand of T ramosissima (up to approx. 500 kgH(2)O m(-2) year(-1)). Using the total above-ground biomass in the calculation, WUEp was highest in C. caput-medusae and P euphratica, and lowest, in A. sparsifolia. From soil and plant water relations, and against the background of the climate and the productivity of the vegetation, it is concluded that all perennial plants in the transition zone between oases and desert in that region must have sufficient access to ground water to ensure long-term survival. Management of ground water such that it remains continuously accessible to the perennial plants is a prerequisite for the conservation and sustainable use of the vegetation in the transition zone.

DE CBT; homelessness; rough sleepers; alcohol and substance misuse
AB This paper describes a project set up to treat four homeless men using cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). The referral criteria were that individuals had alcohol and/or substance misuse problems, were roofless (i.e. sleeping rough) immediately before the intervention began and found it difficult or impossible to access hostel places in Southampton. Excessive alcohol use, violence (against self, others and property) and prison sentences were all features of their presentation. The project involved three levels of CBT intervention provided by the clinical psychologist: 1) training for the staff to enable them to work within this model; 2) continued supervision within model to ensure consistency and sustainability; 3) individual formulation (description of the problem within the CBT framework) and psychotherapy. The house itself was also run on a collaborative basis. A number of measures including mental health and social functioning constructs were used to evaluate the project, in addition to some qualitative data. All residents reduced incidents of theft, violence and alcohol consumption. Risk to self and others was also reduced for all residents. Perceived self-efficacy increased slightly for all residents, and staff perceived that they could be more effective, less hopeless, and therefore possibly less stressed as a result of training. More data will be gathered over time.

AB Dragonflies have been proposed as indicators for the ecosystem health of freshwater wetlands. For their useful functioning as indicators it is, however, necessary to identify species compositions in specific habitats and species-habitat associations, particularly in the tropics, where such knowledge is still weak. We examined the dragonfly species composition of 133 localities in the arid environment of western Namibia. An analysis of nestedness indicated that distinct, and predictable patterns of species associations can be expected. Discriminant analyses revealed that most of the nine habitat types separated by structural and hydrological parameters are well discriminated by their dragonfly assemblages. Spring brooks in particular host a specific assemblage, which is threatened due to the habitat restriction of several species, as well as by recent habitat loss and degradation. Using a hierarchical method of several criteria we demonstrated the selection of a set of potential indicator species from the species set, most of these being useful indicators for spring brook assemblages. The conservation status of certain habitats and species is discussed. We propose that dragonflies will have a high indicator potential for threatened freshwater wetlands in such areas and may also serve as an indication of the sustainable use of water resources including evaluating measures to rehabilitate environments.

AB Assessment of Coleopteran diversity and abundance was carried out in the lowveld region of Swaziland by pitfall trapping in five distinct habitats. Additionally, the study was to ascertain if any of the families collected illustrated habitat fidelity. 18 coleopteran families, comprising 2903 individuals were collected, with an additional 29 unidentified specimens, totalling 2932 beetles. Numerically, the top five families were the Scarabaeidae (2425), Carabidae (211), Tenebrionidae (149), Nitidulidae (37) and Curculionidae (22). 66.6% of all specimens collected were harboured within the pine windbreak while the lowest number (2.6%) was collected from the mature citrus orchard. The highest proportion (77%) of scarabaeid beetles collected occurred within the pine windbreak. Habitat specificity was illustrated by one family, Meloidae, which was found only in the young orchard. Community analysis was further carried out to ascertain distribution patterns of the dominant coleopteran families. Three scarabaeid species were found only in the pine windbreak while three carabid species occurred only in the indigenous savanna. Significant differences between habitats were observed in the number of beetles collected while no significant differences were observed in terms of the number of families observed in each habitat (p < 0.05). Results indicate that conservation of the various habitat patches within the mosaic studied could facilitate conservation of whole communities rather than individual species thus facilitating effective conservation of the agricultural landscape.

AB Recent reports show importance of pollinators to coffee and importance of ants as pollinators or floral protectors in many systems. Arthropod and pollinator diversity, however, declines with management intensification of coffee (Coffea arabica) agroecosystems. We investigated influences of both flying pollinators and ants on coffee fruit set and fruit weight in one high-shade (high-biodiversity) and one low-shade (low-biodiversity) coffee farm in Chiapas, Mexico through exclusion experiments. Contradictory to previous reports, flying pollinators alone did not affect coffee fruit set or fruit weight. Individual fruit weights, however, were higher on branches with both ants and flying pollinators (1.78 g +/- 0.312 (SE)) compared to branches without ants (1.03 +/- 0.029) or branches without ants or flying pollinators (1.05 +/- 0.049), but only in the high-shade site. Although the mechanisms producing higher fruit weights are unknown, we discuss how ants or ant-flying pollinator interactions under high-shade coffee management may contribute to increased fruit weight and the implications of high-shade management for both sustainable coffee production and biodiversity conservation.

AB This paper compares the degree of actual implementation of different farming techniques used by organic and conventional olive growers in Andalusia (a region in the south of Spain) as a means to achieve a twofold objective. On the one hand, the aim is to assess if the analysed farming techniques are significantly different between both types of olive growers and whether their implementation is widespread. On the other hand, it is necessary to establish whether the aforesaid techniques can be considered to be the best possible options from an environmental, economic and/or agronomic point of view. The analysis has taken into account many relevant techniques in olive growing so that planting, soil management, irrigation, fertilization, phytosanitation, harvesting, transport and pruning have all been studied. Results show how in organic farming, in almost all the cases, more appropriate techniques from an environmental, economic and/or agronomic perspective are being used than in conventional farming. However, there is still a long way ahead until the optimal techniques are the trend in both types of production systems. In this sense organic agriculture must be ahead of conventional and other alternative forms of agriculture to prove and increase its superior value to society. Organic farming regulations should better define obligatory, recommended and forbidden organic practices, for each crop cultivated and in as local a context as possible, and so overcome the present lack of regulation of some technical aspects, prevent the diffusion of undesired agricultural practices and encourage implementation of sustainable and rational ones.

TI Soil nutrient status of organic farms in flanders: An overview and a
   comparison with the conventional situation
SO BIOLOGICAL AGRICULTURE & HORTICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
ID PHOSPHORUS; MINERALIZATION; CARBON
AB Organic farming is put forward as a sustainable alternative to the conventional way of farming. However, until now there has been practically no research on soil related aspects of organic farming in Flanders. Therefore, in this study, the carbon, nitrogen, sulphur and phosphorus status of the fields on organic farms was measured and was related to characteristics of the farms involved (land use, soil texture, management intensity and time since conversion to organic farming) and was, where possible, compared with the general soil fertility status of agricultural soils in Flanders. The SOC (soil organic carbon) contents tended to be larger in the fields of the organic farms studied than in conventional farming. This content was correlated positively with the management intensity of the fields. However, some of the organic fields still had rather low SOC contents. To increase this content organic farmers will need to apply more organic materials with large C:N and C:P ratios taking into account the strict current manure legislation. The mineral N contents on the organic farms measured in the period between I October 2003 and 15 November 2003, indicating the risk of nitrate leaching, were well below the average values of the different land use classes of conventional agricultural soils in East Flanders. The available P content of the organic fields was high to very high as is also the case for conventional agriculture in East Flanders and was strongly related to the management intensity.

TI Effects of poultry litter amended steer diets and subsequent manure
   collecting systems on nutrient recovery in composted manures
SO BIOLOGICAL AGRICULTURE & HORTICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
ID QUALITY; COWS
AB Concentrate feeds have become an important feature of dairy cattle diets on small-scale farms in the Central Kenya Highlands. Excreta derived from such diets can be of high quality if nutrient losses are minimized. Steers were fed a basal diet of Napier grass supplemented with either commercial dairy meal at 0.5% of liveweight (low concentrate - LC) or dairy meal (0.5% liveweight) plus poultry litter (0.5% liveweight) (high concentrate - HQ. The amount of faeces and urine collected. and the dry matter. N and K contents of the resulting manure composted with wheat straw were significantly higher with the HC than with the LC diet, and this was the case also for P and Ca content when urine was added. Significant linear relationships were observed between the daily N intake and the daily N collected in faeces and urine. Dry matter, N, K and Ca were also higher when urine was added to the faeces and straw during accumulation than when urine was excluded. and this was the case also for P with high concentrate diets. Appropriate manure management could significantly improve nutrient conservation on smallholder farms in the Central Kenya Highlands and contribute to the sustainability of intensive cropping.

AB The southeastern United States is a center of aquatic species diversity and endemism in North America, but many taxa are imperiled or in decline. Proactive conservation strategies depend on developing sensitive measures of ecological response to environmental degradation early in the process. In the southern Appalachian highlands, much of the region has reforested following extensive logging and agriculture in the last century, but recently exurban development has surged. Patterns of aquatic ecosystem response to these changes were examined in 36 watersheds along a gradient of forest cover from moderately to heavily forested. A linear combination of watershed-scale measures reflecting the extent contemporary forest cover, the trajectory of forest cover change over time, and building and road density were stronger predictors of fish assemblage composition than topographic features. A measure of biotic homogenization relating the abundance of endemic highland fishes to abundance of broad-ranged fishes was sensitive to the gradient of anthropogenic disturbance. Across the watershed disturbance gradient, cosmopolitan species were clear winners as forms unique to the Appalachian highlands were lost. Similar measures of homogenization may be suitable elsewhere for tracking early warning signs of ecosystem stress, particularly in regions with significant endemism. Quantification of the homogenization process in response to urban development and other stressors is a promising avenue for proactive conservation, land use planning, and sustainable development efforts.

AB Water chestnut, Trapa natans, has become a major invasive plant in shallow water bodies in the northeastern United States. The failure of chemical and mechanical means to provide long-term and economically sustainable suppression of the species resulted in interest in the development of biological control. Field Surveys in Asia and Europe identified a number of potential biological control agents in the native range of T natans. The most promising species appeared to be the leaf beetle Galerucella birmanica, which is considered a pest of farmed T natans in China. However, initial attempts to develop biological control faltered when field observations in China suggested that G. birmanica may not be host specific. Of particular concern was attack on water shield, Brasenia schreberi, a species native to China and North America. We conducted a number of laboratory and field investigations in China to assess preference and performance of G. birmanica on T natans and B. schreberi. Initial no-choice experiments using 19 different plant species in 13 different families demonstrated that G. birmanica oviposited and was able to complete development only on Trapa spp. and B. schreberi. In larval no-choice tests G. birmanica was able to complete development on B. schreberi, however, larvae showed a 20% increase in mortality and longer development time compared to larvae developing on T natans. In laboratory and field choice tests adults strongly preferred T natans and in the field only occasionally laid eggs on B. schreberi. In addition, adults emerging from larvae reared on B. schreberi were less fit with reduced feeding and a declining oviposition rate. Their strong preference for T natans was maintained in the field, even when T natans was completely defoliated and adults were forced to migrate. We found only occasional "spill-over" of beetles onto B. schreberi and our data indicate that G. birmanica is a more promising biological control agent of T natans than previously thought, although additional host specificity tests with many more North American plant species need to be completed.

AB It is expected that international biomass trade will significantly increase in the coming years because of the possibly lower costs of imported biomass, the better supply security through diversification and the support by energy and climate policies of various countries. Concerns about potential negative effects of large-scale biomass production and export, like deforestation or the competition between food and biomass production, have led to the demand for sustainability criteria and certification systems that can control biomass trade. Because neither such criteria and indicator sets nor certification systems for sustainable biomass trade are yet available, the objective of this study is to generate information that can help to develop them. For these purposes, existing certification systems, sets of sustainability criteria or guidelines on environmental or social sound management of resources are analyzed with the purpose to learn about the requirements, contents and organizational set ups of a certification system for sustainable biomass trade. First, an inventory of existing systems was made; second, their structures were analyzed. Key finding from the analysis of internationally applied certification systems was that they are generally led by an international panel that represents all countries and stakeholders involved in the biomass production and trade activities. In third and fourth steps different approaches to formulate standards were described and a list of more than 100 social, economic, ecological and general criteria for sustainable biomass trade was extracted from the reviewed systems. Fifth, methods to formulate indicators, that make sustainability criteria measurable, and verifiers that are used to control the performance of indicators are described. It is recommended to further develop the criteria and indicator (C&I) sets for sustainable biomass trade by involvement of the relevant stakeholders (e.g. biomass producer and consumer) and the analysis of local conditions (e.g. local production potentials and limits, and preferences of local people).

AB This study re-examined a previously published relationship between supply and demand for woodfuel at different spatial scales within Kampong Thom Province, Cambodia. We considered three different scales: The first was the whole area of the province. The second scale calculated village-scale data in zones of 1, 3, and 5 km from each village and then aggregated for all villages of the province. The third scale also calculated data for the three zones at the village-scale, but the data were then aggregated according to three regional groupings based on population density and forest availability. When evaluating woodfuel supply, we excluded biomass increment of trees with diameter larger than 30 cm because it was found that local people rarely collect trees larger than 30 cm for fuel. On the demand side, dead wood, which was included in the previous assessment, and woodfuel obtained from non-forest sources were excluded to enable comparison of supply and demand that related only to living trees originating from forests. The re-assessment revealed large decreases in both supply and demand at each scale as compared with our previous assessment; supply reduced by 46% and demand by 36% at the whole province scale. However, the ratios of supply to demand at each scale examined were very similar for both assessments. This reassessment therefore supports our previous findings: there is a deficiency in woodfuel resources in areas of high population density along the main road due to high woodfuel demand and a predominance of agricultural land and regrowth forest in close proximity to villages. This study underscores the usefulness of taking detailed woodfuel consumption patterns into account when assessing the impact of woodfuel demand on forests. For a more accurate assessment on the sustainability of woodfuel resources and utilization, further research is needed to project future woodfuel demand, not only for green wood from forested sources, but also for dead wood and woodfuel from non-forested sources.

AB Variations in growth, above- and below-ground biomass and nutrient distribution were examined in five clones (G3, G48, 65/27, D121 and S7C1) of Populus deltoides grown under agrisilviculture system in sub-humid tropics of Central India. The monoclonal blocks were planted at 4 x 5 in in a randomized block design with three replications. Diameter at breast height (dbh) and tree height were consistently higher in clone 65/27 and lowest in clone S7C1. Mean annual increments (MAI) in dbh and height were 1.6 and 1.3 times higher in clone 65/27 compared to clone S7C1. Total biomass varied from 48.5 to 62.2 Mg ha(-1) in six-year-old clones. In rank order, the total biomass of clones was: 65/27 > D121 > G48 > G3 > S7C1. Stem wood accounted 60.4-68.9% to total biomass followed by coarse roots (12.2-18.9%), branches (12.3-15%), leaves (3.02-6.9%) and fine roots (1.5-2.7%). Root-shoot ratio ranged from 0.2 to 0.35. It was highest in clone G48 and lowest in clone S7C1. In six-year-old clones, total N ranged from 184.3 to 266.3 kg ha(-1), P from 16.8 to 31.1 kg ha(-1) and K from 81.9 to 128.7 kg ha(-1). Total N and P were highest in clone 65/27, while K in clone G48. Nutrients were lowest in clone S7C1. In general, maximum nutrients (N, P and K) were allocated to above-ground components (leaves > stem > branches) than below-ground components. Available N, P and K in the soil improved significantly after six years of planting. It was higher in 0-20 cm and decreased with soil depth. At 0-20 cm soil depth, N increased from 14.9% to 24.1%, P from 17.2% to 23.3% and K from 3.1% to 5.1% under different clones. The yield of both soybean and wheat reduced under poplar clones. Yield losses in soybean ranged from 10.1% to 33% and wheat from 15% to 30.3% under different clones. The management strategies for reducing tree-crop competition and nutrient export from the site under P. deltoides based agrisilviculture system for achieving sustainable production are discussed.

AB The relationship between geography and public policy in the UK has recently been the subject of lively debate in two leading geographical journals - the 'Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers' and 'Process in Human Geography'. This paper draws on this debate to provide a framework for exploring rural geography's relationship with agri-environment policy (AEP); an area of public policy designed to improve the environmental sustainability of the agricultural sector and which has been developing apace since the mid 1980s. Three areas of rural geographical research on AEP are identified and discussed: farmer participation studies; institutional and political analyses of AEP; and post-structural analyses of AEP. The paper concludes with a consideration of the depth and impact on policy of this body of research and makes suggestions for improving its policy reach.

AB Quite a large number of mountainous areas are disadvantaged areas suffering such problems as a fall in population, economic decline and territorial disconnection. They are territories that urgently require the adoption of measures to improve the economic situation and the quality of life of their inhabitants in order to assure their survival as living spaces. Territorial planning can offer solutions that will help to achieve a better and sustainable use of the numerous resources that these areas enjoy. The exhaustive territorial reconnaissance and territorial diagnosis undertaken in the emblematic Cantabrian region of The River Pas Mountains, as well as the proposals put forward to implement their integral development, can indeed serve as a comparable model for other mountain areas.

DE sustainables policys; rural development; mountain
AB This work offers a global view of public action in the spaces of those Spanish regions that have been officially qualified as disfavoured or needing special intervention, as is the case of the mountain zones. In Spain, these territories, basically rural, show a remarkable heterogeneity, referred indistinctly to its economic, social, cultural or ecological structures. This plural reality has been conditioned during the last years by four main factors: 1) the inner transformations of the agroalimentary sector; 2) the changes in the space organisation of the population and its activities, as a result of the restructuring of capitalism; 3) the new socioeconomic, sociocultural and environmental functions of these spaces; 4) and the impact, sometimes contradictory, of the different public policies implemented over these spaces, evolving more and more neatly under de paradigm of the institutional durable development.

AB The analysis of the relationship between the tourism development model and its implications in the consume of water, provide us with ideas and criteria to set up a context for the meaning and the scope of tourism as a water consuming sector in the territorial development. This paper aims to introduce some questions regarding the current tourist model and some predictable future trends taking as a reference the aspects of quality and sustainability this sector requires and its effects in the water management. To achieve this aim, it is interesting to assess the relationship between water consuming and the different tourist models together with the need to consider the importance of the water resources in the tourism dynamic from a sustainable perspective.

AB Title: Public policies, rural tourism and sustainability: a difficult balance. There is a shortage in rural development policies in Spain, which have been mainly developed on the basis of European LEADER and PRODER programmes. Rural tourism has been one of the most benefited activities which has helped local development in rural areas. This paper shows the connections among recent changes in rural areas, the unequal utilization of resources from these areas, the absence of public policies for integrated tourism, tourism sustainability and, in particular, rural tourism sustainability. Rural tourism pros and contras from the socioeconomical, cultural and environmental point of view will be studied as well.

AB The regional government of Aragon (Spain) has taken on the environmental and sustainable development policy proposed by the European Union. This policy was defined in the Nature Network, in the agro-environmental measures and in the 2000-2006 Programmes. However, the implementation of these policies has not yet achieved all its goals. These problems are as yet unsolved due to lack of coordination and dysfunctions that are slowing down the development of rural areas.

Between them the planning and the land management. It is very related to they and also with the environment and the programs of territorial development. The globalization, the role of the big cities, the revaluation of the local thing and the regional thing and the concept of sustainable development appear also in the new scene of action of this new Regional Geography.

DE rural development; social sustainability
AB The evaluation of the results obtained by the programs of rural development must include the analysis of the real possibilities derived from the social, economic and territorial conditions of the affected areas. Because of that, it may be pretentious to speak of intervention strategies of land management, in a sense of conscious elections to mark a development tendency, in spaces and social groups that have very limited options. In the case of Castile and Leon the local agents have been able of turning, applying an enormous pragmatism, the little existing options in the axes of their actions of local development, obtaining even some commendable results relating to the investment and economic advance, although their social effects have had a limited significance.

In this case one has chosen to study the price that it has supposed to the Andalusian population and to his territory. There are done a quantitative analysis referred to the projects and investments, and linked to his beneficiaries (municipalities and promoters). With all this it is tried to advance, overcoming a vision economicista of the sustainability, since this one is not only physical and economic, but of it informs the social value to give to provide with competitiveness to these spaces.

DT Article
DE sustainability; rural culture; actors; networks; Catalonia
ID FOOD
AB This paper has the objective of examining the relationships between rural culture and sustainability taking as an example the case of Catalonia. We argue that these relationships are mediated by particular and antagonic views of nature and society, of cities and the countryside as Strictly separated environments. In our opinion, this separation is critical to understand the problematic relationships that exist between rural culture and environmental conservation. Within Geography there have been various attempts to overcome the dualism nature-society such as systems theory, historical materialism o, more recently, actor-network theory. This last approach offer a relational view of interest for geographers and nature-society studies in that it dilutes dualisms in network of actors, both natural and social. The end of tensions between rural and urban areas could come through a new social contract admitting the specificities of the rural and offering a guarantee of a rural sustainability not threatening the productive base. The paper draws the basic lines of this contract and ends with a brief methodological account on how to (re)examine the relationships between sustainability and rural culture.

DE raw materials; red-body/white-body ceramics; tiles; refractories
AB The ceramics and glass industry in Spain has witnessed spectacular growth in recent years - particularly in the latter half of the 1990s - in products such as ceramic tiles, bricks and roofing tiles, driven by the building boom in Spain. However, at the start of the 21st century, growth has clearly flattened, owing to the emergence of production hubs in China, Brazil and Asian-Pacific countries. Raw materials have played a critical role in this new scenario, owing their impact on final product cost. With a view to analysing this role the present study first describes the principal raw materials used in ceramics and glass compositions, briefly indicating the functions of these raw materials. The study then reviews the evolution of raw materials consumption and prices in a strongly globalised business context, and seeks to identify the causes of certain mismatches between supply and demand. Finally, the challenges facing raw materials supply are discussed, particularly in regard to sustainable development of resources, threats and advantages of the global market, and research and development of new materials.

SO BOLLETTINO DELLA SOCIETA GEOLOGICA ITALIANA

DE Erosion rate; vineyards; Burgundy
AB Burgundian vineyards are affected by erosion phenomena that induce sediment transfer along hillslopes. The vineyard under study has occupied the western Bressan rift border for 1000 years, benefiting from marly limestone bedrock and its silt-sand covering. The combined effects of rainstorms and monoculture on slopes reaching 25, induce a high level of erosion in the arable soil layer. Quantification of erosion rates on a pluri-decennial scale, using vine roots as a palaeo-surface marker, has been performed on three parcels on three sites along the Cotes-de-Nuits and Cotes-de-Beaune. Assessed erosion rates of around 1 mm.yr(-1) characterise current erosive dynamics involving a critical situation for soil sustainability, and consequently for terroir conservation.

AB Purpose - The aim of this exploratory study was to examine and compare a range of business values held by farmers and food processors.
   Design/methodology/approach - Questionnaires with a section on business values were posted to 200 farmers and 200 food processing businesses in Victoria, Australia, with response rates of 44 per cent (n = 69) and 31 per cent (n = 48), respectively, achieved.
   Findings - The most important of the 28 value items for farmers were high quality produce, honesty, and caring for employees. For processors, the most important values were quality products, customer value, and caring for employees. Between group differences reached statistical significance for one-third of the items. In particular, processor businesses valued innovation and convenience products more highly and had a stronger process orientation than did farming businesses. Environmental sustainability, caring for the community, and providing healthy products were more integral to farming than processing businesses.
   Research limitations/implications - The main limitation was the small sample sizes, although it is likely that response bias was not high. Future research could survey a larger sample of food industry representatives and examine the values held by other food industry sectors.
   Practical implications - This information could increase the effectiveness of communications with industry groups on a range of issues and in the formulation of appropriate health and environmental policies.
   Originality/value - To the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to compare the values of fanners; and food processors. This information is particularly important for those in the food industry and health and environmental policy makers.

TI The economics of reindeer herding - Saami entrepreneurship between
   cyclical sustainability and the powers of state and oligopolies
SO BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
DE culture (sociology); government policy; meat; entrepreneurialism; Norway
AB Purpose - This paper attempts to explain the drastic fall in income experienced by Saami reindeer herders in Nor-them Norway between 1976 and 2000, in spite of increasing government subsidies. Saami herders maintain a legal monopoly as suppliers of reindeer meat, a traditional luxury product in Norway.
   Design/methodology/approach - This paper shows that a review of the literature is supported by qualitative interviews.
   Findings - The paper argues that main explanatory variables are to be found in the interaction of a number of factors, mainly: cyclical climatic variation in Northern Norway; a system with fixed prices, independent of the variations in supply, that magnified the effects of the natural cycles; increasingly severe sanitary regulations forcing Saami herders to abandon slaughtering and preparation; and the oligopoly market powers of the non-Saami actors taking over slaughtering and processing. It is argued that the fall in herders' income resulted from a failure of the Norwegian Department of Agriculture to understand key factors distinguishing sub-Arctic herding from sedentary agriculture. Sanitary requirements and the government's quest for economies of scale in processing contributed to playing the volume of production into the hands of non-Saami oligopolies. In this way the Saami herders lost the meat production that traditionally was at the core of both their culture and their economic livelihood.
   Originality/value - The paper is relevant for the management of herding and other production systems in areas with cyclical production, and documents the damaging effects on the aboriginal culture resulting from Norway's exclusive use of modem agricultural science in managing such systems.

TI Environmentally sustainable food production and marketing - Opportunity
   or hype?
SO BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
DE sustainable development; organic foods; value chain
ID CONSUMERS; DECISION; GREEN; LCA
AB Purpose - To identify and analyse the beliefs of value-chain intermediaries regarding the production and marketing of food products conforming to environmentally sustainable standards.
   Design/methodology/approach - The methodology was in-depth, semi-structured, face-to-face inter-views with senior managers of food companies across the value chain.
   Findings - In Australia, the demand for foods that are produced under environmentally sustainable standards has been slow to take-off because customers do not perceive these products as offering any special benefits; customers distrust the claims made by organisations; these products are much more expensive than traditional products, and the implementation of environmental standards is expensive. Customers claim that the use of different terminologies such as organic, green and environmentally friendly in promoting food products is confusing.
   Research limitations/implications - Findings are not generalisable because the study is based on a small sample.
   Practical implications - Value-chain intermediaries are unlikely to voluntarily adopt environmental standards because of low demand for such foods and the high costs of adopting and monitoring environmentally sustainable production and marketing regimes.
   Originality/value - The story supports previous research findings from the USA and EU.

   industry; food industry; United Kingdom
AB Purpose - The research (funded by the Esmee Fairbairn Foundation) aims to support the UK Public Sector Food Procurement Initiative by working with leading contract caterers to develop principles of sustainable food procurement and key performance indicators to measure progress in putting them into practice.
   Design/methodology/approach - Initial informal discussions with catering contractors confirmed the need for the research and explored ideas as to how to take it forward. Extensive secondary research then informed the development of nine draft principles of sustainable food procurement. These were further refined following review by individual companies. An expert panel was then convened for final drafting and to reach consensus.
   Research limitations/implications - The research provides operating principles that can be used to inform procurement practice. However changing organisational practice, particularly in large organizations, is challenging and will take time. The researchers have produced a guide to assist implementation and monitoring of progress.
   Practical implications - Public sector catering is only 7 per cent of the total catering market by value. Therefore progress in this sector has a limited impact on the overall catering food supply chain. Only five of the original nine principles were adopted, so not all aspects of the sustainability agenda may be addressed.
   Originality/value - The paper has value in assisting the implementation of UK Government policy towards sustainable food. Participants in the research are dominant within public sector contract catering and have reached consensus as to which aspects of the sustainability agenda it is feasible to progress at the present time.

TI Learning from the 'wow' factor - how to engage customers through the
   design of effective affective customer experiences
SO BT TECHNOLOGY JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB 'I think' exceeds expectations' is the most pitiful pair of words uttered in the English language. Our aspirations are too low. Think Cirque de Soleil, not Siegfried and Roy. Aim to put a shiver up your customers' spines. That's what you should even be trying to do with your call centers', Tom Peters, Uber-Guru.
   In a survey by Shaw and Ivens [1], 85% of business leaders said that differentiation by price, product and service is no longer a sustainable business strategy. 71% of these leaders also stated that they believed that 'customer experience' is the new battleground. The same survey found that customers found 44% of customer experiences to be bland and uneventful. Yet only 15% of companies are actually starting to engage customers on both an efficient and emotionally engaging manner. The implication is that companies which start to leverage the power of emotion in the purchasing decision-making process, and leverage that power to improve the customer experience, are likely to succeed in an increasingly commoditised market.
   How do companies who are renowned for outstanding levels of customer experience, loyalty and advocacy achieve these levels? To find the answer to that question, this paper looks across organisations globally to find out how the best achieve effective affective customer experiences across all contact channels. A distinct pattern emerged.

AB The vulnerability of the built environment will be influenced by global-scale climate change. However, there are large uncertainties associated with the future performance of buildings due: to changes in regional- and local-scale climatic impact. The use of modern risk-management theories is discussed for developing cross-disciplinary strategies to meet the challenges of future climate change. It is shown that there are benefits to be gained from the introduction of risk-management strategies within a greater extent of the construction industry. Cross-disciplinary risk-based management strategies (ensuring cooperation along vertical decision-making lines), together with design guidelines that account for both historical local climatic conditions and scenarios for future changes, can be an important step towards a more active and dynamic way of ensuring a high-quality construction process and a sustainable built environment. Reducing the potential for defects or damage through the development of technical and organizational preventive measures (a risk-based management strategy) while at the same time applying the precautionary principle and discursive strategies in the design, construction and geographical localization of buildings, is likely to increase the robustness of the built environment in the light of the unknown risks of future climate change.

   governance; innovation; natural ventilation; performance-based
   regulation; regulation; sustainability; UK
AB There is a developing interest in achieving low-energy, naturally ventilated, non-domestic buildings in significant numbers over a relatively short period that is driven by the government's commitment to achieve reductions in carbon dioxide emissions and building owners' interests in reducing life cycle costs. The presumption is that this is possible within the current regulatory context. However, design for natural ventilation of public buildings is still innovative, at least within the regulatory framework. Two case studies involving the implementation of natural ventilation schemes indicate the concern and barriers raised by local authority Building Control departments, the fire authorities and various prospective insurers in response to design proposals. The design strategies devised fell outside the provisions of the prevailing codes and regulations in their approach to ensuring safe and effective fire control and smoke clearance using natural ventilation. The destabilizing effects of the current regulatory system impact negatively on the use of natural ventilation and hinder innovation. Schemes proposing to incorporate natural ventilation may be rejected through risk- and value-engineering exercises because of;perceived uncertainties about compliance with current fire regulations and codes, and the time and cost implications of embarking on an exercise to prove at least equivalence in the creation of a safe environment.

TI Life cycle assessment of built-in-storage solar water heaters in
   Pakistan
SO BUILDING SERVICES ENGINEERING RESEARCH & TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Sustainability of building construction and its services is increasingly drawing attention. In this respect CIBSE has issued a number of calls to industry. Solar water heating systems are now economically competitive and are being used throughout the world. Following earlier work of the present authors on the life cycle assessment (LCA) for building components,(1,2) this work presents a monetary, energy usage and environmental impact assessment for solar water heaters. It has been shown herein that for a developing country like Pakistan where large amounts of hot water are required within industry, solar water heating offers favorable payback periods on each of the above three counts. It has been estimated that under the tested conditions, the embodied energy payback period for the plain and finned heater is equivalent to 185 days and 169 days respectively. It has also been found that the amount of carbon released during the construction process of plain and finned water heaters is 27.9 kg and 29.7 kg respectively. Annual carbon saving for the plain and finned water heaters has been calculated to be equivalent to 59.5 kg and 69.6 kg respectively, which in turn gives a carbon payback period of 156 days and 171 days. The monetary payback period for the plain and finned heater has been found to be equivalent to 6.7 years and 6.1 years respectively.

TI The role of the public toilet: pathogen transmitter or health
   facilitator?
SO BUILDING SERVICES ENGINEERING RESEARCH & TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID PROVISION; RISK
AB This paper discusses the role of public toilets, as transmitters of disease, but also of their importance in contributing to the health and well-being of society. Research has shown that public toilets are vital components in creating sustainable, accessible, inclusive cities. But there is no mandatory legislation requiring local authorities to provide them. Over 40% have been closed in the UK in the last 10 years. The promotion of the 24 hour city, characterized by a male youth drinking culture, along with toilet closure, has resulted in increased street urination, creating the conditions for the spread of previously-eradicated, waterborne diseases in city streets. Less visible, but as virulent, has been the effect of toilet closure for women. Women, in response to lack of toilet provision, are likely to 'hold on' resulting in urine (and pathogen) retention, and bladder distension increasing the propensity for continence problems. The elderly and people with disabilities may simply not go out for fear of there being no toilet when they need one. Those toilets that are available may be unusable. Lack of regulation or compulsory standards result in poor toilet design, inadequate maintenance and management, and unhygienic conditions, resulting in the spread of MRSA and other drug-resistant diseases. Recommendations are summarized for the provision of a spatial hierarchy of toilet provision that would both meet user needs and reduce the chances of the public toilets acting as epicentres of germ transmission. Unless compulsory legislation, increased funding, and improved management, maintenance and cleaning regimes are instigated, public toilet provision will continue to be a source of disease.

TI Problems with specialist subcontracting in the construction industry
SO BUILDING SERVICES ENGINEERING RESEARCH & TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID FIRM
AB It is envisaged that more and more specialist works will be employed in modern buildings for enhancing performance and sustainability. Subcontracting is an economical way of procuring specialist works for modern buildings but it may also give rise to various kinds of problems. Such problems may originate from the characteristics of the specialist works and from subcontracting as a procurement method. In the paper, the key characteristics of specialist works are identified and their implications are analysed. Through discussing how new technologies penetrate the market, the pricing strategies that vendors of new technologies may adopt together with their implications are unveiled. The problems with procuring specialist works through subcontracting are then reviewed, and the issues that building developers should take note of in deciding to equip a building with a specialist work and in procurement and management of the specialist subcontract are highlighted and discussed.
   Practical application: By providing an in-depth exposition on subcontracting within the construction industry, the paper can act as a source of information and guide for those initiating and managing projects that involve substantial amounts of subcontracting, especially to project clients when they procure specialist works through subcontracting. The potential problems discussed include not only those that may arise during the construction stage, readers' attention is also drawn to the impacts on operation and maintenance and the aftermarket monopoly power of vendors of proprietary products and services.

AB Habitat use by stocked and native brown trout (Salmo trutta L.) was assessed in two headwater streams of North-eastern Portugal. Underwater observations were made during the summer season in three successive years to evaluate the effect of supplemental trout stocking. Multivariate analysis techniques applied to data sets on microhabitat use were exploited to identify the focal elevation (distance of fish from the bottom), total depth and cover as the variables that contribute most to the discrimination between stocked and native trout. Preference curves computed for native and stocked trout of the same age (1+), showed a distinct pattern in their ability to explore the available microhabitat resources. Stocked trout tended to occupy deeper pools (total depth > 100 cm vs. 60-100 cm for native trout), holding higher focal elevations (140-160 cm vs. < 20 cm for native) with lower water column velocities (< 10 cm.s(-1) vs. 10-20 cm.s(-1) for native) and no specific preference for cover. In contrast, native trout displayed a clear preference for microhabitats with coarse substrate (particle size > 22.5 cm) and cover (combination of boulders and overhanging vegetation or undercut banks). Furthermore, a high post-stocking movement of 80% hatchery-reared fish was verified just one month after their release, suggesting that stocking did not contribute to the sustainable populations in either stream, and is far from being an adequate management technique.

ID DEBATE
AB There is a growing need for international cooperation among developing countries in order to increase the contribution of artificial reefs to reverse the trend of fisheries resource depletion. To establish desirable directions for future cooperation in this field, we analyzed three recent artificial reef projects in the Philippines and Senegal. Past experience has begun to teach us that artificial reef deployment alone does not produce clear, positive effects in enhancing fisheries resources, but rather leads to the opposite effect of attracting fishing activities in protected areas. As poverty among fishermen lies behind this problem, it is imperative to include economic activities, such as commercialization of highly valued fish in artificial reef projects. Income from such activities can be used to compensate for the decline of income due to reduction of catch and to raise funds for sustainable surveillance of undesirable fishing practices on the artificial reefs. Furthermore, artificial reef projects must be integrated in a broader fisheries management plan in order to be effective. Unless the positive impacts of artificial reefs are clearly established, they should not be overestimated. While a participator), approach is desirable for an artificial reef project, the ideal outcome should be co-management by fishing communities and the government.

AB Net pen finfish farms release large quantities of organic particles and dissolved nutrients to the surrounding waters. The present study addresses the possibility of harvesting some of these effluents in order to reduce environmental impacts. Experimental mid-water artificial structures (plastic mesh cylinders) were deployed adjacent to a sea bream fish farm in the northern Gulf of Aqaba, Red Sea, and at a nearby reference site in order to observe whether the biofouling communities that developed on these were different in terms of biomass, diversity, and species richness. The cylinders were sampled every other month for a period of 11 mo and we found significantly higher species richness and biomass at the fish farm than at the reference site throughout the study period. These results indicate that there is merit to using this approach to make net pen fish farming more environmentally sustainable.

AB Interoperability resulted from various evolutions occurring in a modem networked enterprise, or Systems-of-Systems (SoS) is a goal for an organisation to maintain a sustained, sustainable and controlled SoS evolution. A common issue facing networked enterprises in these evolutions is how to systematically manage and effectively achieve desired interoperability meeting new requirements of business and technologies. This paper presents an understanding of challenges in dealing with interoperability in evolutions of networked enterprises or SoS, and discusses an architecture-based approach to interoperability evaluation in various evolutions of networked enterprises.

AB In this paper we present a model that defines performances of a business process. The process is conceived as a service chain that delivers services to customers by a glow that links a set of organizations. This concept implies a wider view of performance. The model includes all the performances that increase overall competitiveness (i.e. classic cost and efficiency indicators are integrated by effectiveness indicators, that measure service level and quality). Second, the model considers the different stakeholders involved in a process: management, customers and operators. The model maps the performance indicators on these perspectives. This multiple perspective can be used in benchmarking and diagnosis to evaluate an existing process or to design a new process.

AB China is not only the leading cotton producer worldwide but has become a structural importer. The wide-scale adoption of genetically modified cotton (GMC) has led some observers, to assume that Chinese production will increase Substantially, thereby limiting its demand from structural cotton-exporting Countries. During negotiations for the WTO Doha Round, fear of China's power in the cotton sector has been transformed into criticism of what is called its unfair Subsidy policy. Both of these views are debatable and suffer from a lack of insight about the development of cotton production in China. This paper attempts to document the debate and to fill that gap. Cotton production in China is located is three main regions, along the Yellow River Valley, the Yangtze River Valley and in the Xinjiang Uigur Autonomous Region, where cotton production only began in the 1970s. This production cannot be considered separately from Chinese agriculture in general, Which is currently undergoing great changes. Despite high yields, agricultural activities no longer ensure sufficient income to farmers. Off-farm activities keep the revenue of rural households from falling further behind that of urban households, but agriculture does not appear to attract the workers of rural areas, and this depopulation raises questions about the fare of farming in the years to come. Its shift towards provinces located further from the economically dynamic coastal areas depends upon the implementation of recent policies intended to correct the income disparities from which rural areas suffer. Cotton is still produced according to the high input/high output approach associated with policies to protect farmers against climatic hazards and economic risks, through input Subsidies and purchase price guarantee. Although China stopped providing direct subsidies to cotton growers when it joined the WTO, intensification of production continues, and the use of GMC call be regarded as a further stage of this intensification process. This relation between past policy and GMC use must be considered before extrapolating Chinese achievements with the latter to other developing countries. The lack of collective action by farmers impedes the Success of the intensification process, makes cotton farming less profitable, and may endanger the sustainable use of GMC by causing undesirable shifts of the cotton pest complex. It is doubtful that China can reverse its importing position in the cotton world market in the Short run. While this may reassure cotton-exploring countries, it Must not prevent them from taking measures to increase their competitiveness through improved productivity.

AB Insecticide resistance in the cotton bollworm (Helicoverpa.)a armigera) in Asia was the major reason for the first commercialisation of Bt cotton to China in 1996 and then in India in 2002. Bt cotton now covers more than 66% of China's cotton area and c. 10% of India's cotton area. The Chinese material is varietal with c.20 locally produced varieties expressing Cry1Ac and/or Cry1Ab, many with CpTi stacked as a second gene. Monsanto has commercialised two US Acala varieties expressing Cry1Ac. So far, the registered Indian material is all in local hybrids, with Monsanto Cry1Ac varieties from USA providing the transgene. It is clear that toxin expression in the tissue varies very significantly across the season and with plant part and cultivar. Late in the season in all tissues and in several tissues throughout the season, toxin expression is inadequate for control of H. armigera in both countries. Insecticide use reductions have been 54-80% for bollworms or 40% for all pests. However, despite GM seed costing c. two to three times more than conventional seed, Bt cotton has proved profitable and its use is expanding rapidly. In China, yield increases have been small but reductions in input costs have led to profitability increases of $360-$800/ha on average in 2002-2004, although farmers still spray all average of 12 times on Bt cotton in Eastern China. In India, total spray costs declined by 70-85%. Given the increased seed price, overall production costs were reduced only slightly (5-15%) but cotton yields have risen by 40-65% and therefore farmer margins have risen strongly (averaging $130/ha in 2002 and $477/ha in 2003). These benefits are highly dependent on the bollworm pressure in any given district in any particular year with district mean increases varying from 14% to 92% in Indian studies to date. Laboratory and semi-field studies in China have characterised the impact of Cry1Ac on non-target pests and a range of natural enemies. Direct impacts oil predator and parasite development are Slight (though significant in some cases). Changes in natural enemy numbers (particularly of specialist species) are affected by the changes in prey availability in Bt fields. As yet there is no significant field resistance to Cry1Ac However genes conferring a semirecessive resistance through truncation of the cadherin target site for the toxin are present in approximately 1 in a thousand H. armigera in China and at least one semi-dominant resistance gene is present in India at similar levels. Modeling suggests that for small farmer systems, imposing an additional mortality on H. armigera surviving in Bt cotton fields is the most efficient way of delaying the development of severe resistance.

AB In sub-saharan Africa, the profitability and sustainability of the cotton crop are key issues for millions of smallholders. in the field of pest management, farmers have to cope with the unsettled impact of an active pest complex. Research has Currently not only to make proposals for pest management in a context of insecticide resistance, but also to find how to properly introduce genetically modified cottons. Research is today able to transfer knowledge about pest population dynamics, about the relations between insects and the plants grown in the ecosystem, about morphological or biochemical barriers against cotton diseases and pests and about the thresholds to be used for a rational chemical control. The main problem is for farmers to integrate these results in the management of their cotton crops. They have to use sowing dates, density and fertilizers in order to minimize pest impact. They have to use chemicals with a good knowledge of both their targets and side-effects. Models have an important place in the decision process, as long as they are easy to use and adapted to farmers' needs and constraints. In the new Picture of the cotton production chain in Africa, research Must be associated not only with the R/D services in cotton companies, but also with emerging farmers' organisations. in the field of varietal improvement, the current evolution is to introduce private companies as seed providers. Competition with national research institutions will be strong. For genetically modified cottons, national research programs leading to the introduction of genes of interest in the local cultivars have to be built. studies on the long-term impact of the innovations are needed, as much in the agronomic field as in the socio-economic and environmental fields. To reduce pesticide use, it is a necessity to train all the stakeholders for a sound approach of chemicals. The development of decision tools is a priority so that the right product is used at the right time. Sustainability of cotton-based agro-systems can also be solved by the choice given to each farmer to adopt practices adapted to his objectives, needs and constraints. The productivity of the cotton crop is a major concern to reduce competition for land especially where food crops are concerned, and farmers must have access to inputs and credit to manage their crops in order to derive the income they deserve. in the future, farmers' organisations will be key players in the formulation of the problems cotton growers have to face, and they will be involved in a strong partnership with public research in the adoption process of technical innovations.

TI Creating bonds in the cotton sector: Participatory breeding in Benin and

   organizations; breeding methods; selection
AB In many cotton-producing Countries, state companies organize the cotton sector, from seed production to lint marketing and extension. Most of them being privatised, their activities are taken over by a number of various actors. This may loosen the bonds between research and most stakeholders, including the farmers. To tighten these bonds, the Centre de cooperation internationale en recherche agronomique pour le developpement (Cirad) has been developing participatory approaches for ten years. Such approaches involve farmers in research and development activities. In particular, two projects of participatory selection have been developed. One was initiated in 1996 in Benin within the Institut national des recherches agricoles du Benin (Inrab, National Institute of Agricultural Researches of Benin). The second one started in 2000 in Paraguay, with the Direction of Agricultural Research (DIA, Direccion de Investigacion Agricola) of the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock. These programs were proposed to assess the relevance and the efficiency of two experimental and participatory designs. They consider two major aspects of cotton improvement: breeding and variety evaluation. In the decentralised scheme developed in Benin, an original and highly heterogenous population was developed by inter-crossing 14 varieties originated from Various countries. From this population, seven samples were taken Out and distributed to three farmer-breeders (F-B), one to the Inrab breeders and three were grown without conscious selection at a close distance of the F-Bs' sites. For six years, the F-Bs selected these populations in the field, on their firms, and also from technological results obtained in the lab (ginning out turn and fibre characteristics). The Inrab breeders did the same on station. Having improved their skills, in 2003 the F-Bs could adopt pedigree instead of mass selection. In 2004, the best lines were compared on station, and also-evaluated through the bell opening phase by farmers' representatives, F-Bs and Inrab breeders. Good lines were produced either by F-Bs or Inrab breeders. Some of them showed great improvement over the original population and they could match the commercial varieties. Most farmers elected four lines, two being produced by the F-Bs and two by the Inrab breeders. Those lines combined rather short internodes, numerous branches loaded with well-opened bolls, and leaves filling at maturity. Farmers did not like later and more vegetative lines which were described as being "good for feeding cattle". When their crop was harvested and weighed, it happened that Such late varieties could be more productive than some of the earlier ones which had first been preferred. Such promising results are not common, especially with a crop meant for industrial processing. They have convinced farmers' representative., who are now concerned with the sustainability of the breeding program, and even with its scaling Lip. In Paraguay, public research is in charge of cotton genetic improvement. More participation is needed from the farmers to appraise their needs and preferences, to influence the breeding programs objectives, and to evaluate new varieties' performances before dissemination. A participatory variety evaluation design was set up in 2003-2004. Called "Base-Satellite" (Spanish), this design was directly inspired from the "Mother-Baby Trial". At each site, a "Base" trial compared the varieties in I replicated Fischer blocks design conducted by technicians.
   At the same site, five "Satellite trials" were planted with I Subset of to new varieties and run by farmers-experimenters (F-Es) on their own firms. All through the growing season, F-Es could compare the new varieties with the commercial variety. They could express their opinions in questionnaires, and confront them during the field-days organised at each Base. Their opinions were compared with the variety performance in the multi-local and multi-annual national variety trial (NVT). The Variety evaluation carried Out by the F-Es' in the Satellites were highly correlated with its mean yield in the NVT (r(2)=0.708). The evaluation carried out in the Base alone was less strictly correlated (r(2)=.445). The design was particularly efficient in (a) pointing out the differences between on-station and on-farm evaluation, and (b) identifying possible defects before dissemination. It was particularly welcomed by the farmers, and could be the central piece of a participatory evaluation design in an organised sector. These two examples contribute to legitimate participatory approaches in cotton genetic improvement. They show how to re-create bonds between research and beneficiaries, when the coherence of the sector has been weakened after the national cotton companies were privatised.

AB A theoretical model of pest management cycles is proposed to assess the sustainability of cotton production systems. This model is based on the interaction process between crop protection practices and ecological dynamics (pest pressure, resistance to pesticides) that influences the proportion of cotton-planted areas in a cultivated ecosystem. Adaptive cycles of cotton production are exemplified by a comparative analysis of several case Studies in Thailand, Australia, and Mali, where cotton areas were similar in the 1980s, but have evolved very differently since then. Over the last two decades, cotton production fell sharply in the former country while it increased rapidly in the other two. The capacity to control pests in an integrated manner at the scale of the agroecosystem is considered as a key driving factor of the changes observed in cotton industries. The three case Studies suggest that several models of social organisation of crop protection can contribute to maintain the ecological and economic viability of cotton production systems.

AB The methodological approach underlying industrial ecology allows an exhaustive appraisal of the flow of materials and energy necessary for the "metabolism" of various economic activities. Study and analysis of these data enable more accurate assessment of activities now underway. They make it possible to look, both in-house and elsewhere, at the effects of complementarity and synergy. Finally, they help to define the strategy that will best enhance resources, by optimizing its economic impact while identifying more clearly its ecological consequences. Using examples from cotton activity, the author demonstrates the value of the concept of industrial ecology in developing sustainable production.

AB The size of the losses in cotton crop yields caused by pests and more particularly by insects necessitates protection against them. Traditional chemical treatment has led to ecological damage and economic and technological dead ends due mainly to the vicious circle of increased insecticide applications, Appearance of resistant insect populations, and development of more expensive new insecticides. Over the past decade, the search for alternative solutions has led to the increasingly Successful use of genetically modified varieties of cotton that express insect toxins. Simultaneously, measures should be taken to prevent development of resistance. These steps could reduce insecticide applications by approximately half for the same output. Use of good agronomic practices, Such as focusing on strategic points in the pest life cycle rather than simply the pest at the level of the crop would help to develop a new kind of crop protection, inspired by agroecological principles. Preventing pest populations from reaching economically harmful levels and preserving the biological diversity of the agro-ecosystems through habitat management become the main objectives of a global strategy that is consistent with the principles of Sustainable development and is implemented by new farming systems. Study of the development of these alternative methods of pest protection for cotton in the very diverse social and agronomic conditions in which they are used can help to adapt these new methods to other types of crops.

AB This paper is a tribute to Dr. R.A. Ring upon his retirement. During the past 12 years (1993-2005), an emerging canopy research program has established a wealth of baseline information on the structure and functioning of temperate rain forest canopy arthropod communities. Studies from research sites on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, have shown that ancient temperate rain forest canopy ecosystems contain a largely undescribed fauna that is specific to habitat features found only in these canopies. In particular, diverse assemblages of free-living mites have been shown to dominate conifer species and canopy microhabitats. For example, oribatid mites are the dominant arthropod fauna on branches, branches with attached lichens, and suspended soil accumulations. Species composition differs significantly between the ground and the canopy at both the family and the species level. Arboreal specificity may be due to intrinsic variation in habitat quality, habitat architecture, patchiness, and (or) resource availability. The prevalent patterns of habitat specialization, low vagility, and restricted distribution displayed by a large percentage of the resident canopy microarthropods are features often associated with forest ecoregions that have enjoyed relatively stable conditions for long periods of time, as have the ancient forests on Vancouver Island. Investigators in the "one-Ring lab" continue to document the diversity and abundance of canopy arthropods of temperate forests in British Columbia. In particular, studies are concerned with defining the organizing principles that elicit community patterns associated with the various levels of complexity in arboreal communities. Our long-term goal is to provide a greater degree of predictability when addressing temperate forest diversity issues. To meet the stated goals of sustainable forest management and retention of biodiversity, an extensive plan of ecological research that features arthropods is needed. This plan, fostered by Dr. Ring, should have as a priority the inventory and cataloguing of species assemblages and should address dynamic processes such as organismal dispersal and the effects of habitat loss and fragmentation on arthropods in ancient forests.

DT Article
AB This paper analyses key changes to international agriculture during the neoliberal period (roughly from the 1980s until today), including structural adjustment, agricultural trade policies, corporate control, and intellectual property rights (IPRs), from two different theoretical perspectives: market-driven economic growth (similar to neoclassical economics) and sustainable agriculture. It first examines what market-driven economic growth and sustainable agriculture say about the ideal structure of the agricultural economy. Next, the paper explores whether the identified changes to international agriculture are consistent with these theories. It finds that there is surprising consistency between the two theories' critiques of the key changes associated with the neoliberal period.

DT Article
ID REGIONAL-INTEGRATION; PROTECTION; AGREEMENTS; POLICY
AB Industrial lobbying has long influenced trade policy in West African countries. At one point, conflicting World Bank and IMF doctrines impeded trade liberalization in West Africa and played into the hands of pressure groups. In the 1990s, the reforms advocated by these two institutions moved into closer alignment, especially as part of support for regional integration. Although the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) tends to favour the status quo in trade policy reform, support of the Washington Consensus and of the European Union has allowed partial trade policy deprivatization by applying a common external tariff (CET). However, maintaining national tax exemptions and incentives very seriously erodes the CET's impact and may jeopardize the reform's sustainability as well as the opportunity to expand the Customs Union to other West African countries with the negotiation of the Economic Partnership Agreement with the European Union.

SO CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID MINERAL SOILS; STEM GROWTH; FOREST; FERTILIZATION
AB Wood-ash applications have been proposed to promote the long-term sustainability of forest production at increased harvest intensities. Effects of wood-ash and nitrogen (N) application on soil-solution chemistry were studied for 9 years following application in a coniferous stand in Sweden. Crushed, self-hardened wood ash was applied at 3, 6, and 9 Mg.ha(-1) alone, the lowest dosage both with and without 150 kg N.ha(-1). Pelleted wood ash (3 Mg.ha(-1)) and N were also applied alone. The soil solution was sampled by suction cups at 50 cm depth. The crushed, self-hardened ash readily dissolved in water, as reflected in increased soil-solution concentrations of sodium and sulphate. Significant (p < 0.05) elevations were also found for potassium, calcium, aluminum, and total organic carbon. Vanadium, chromium, manganese, nickel, copper, zinc, arsenic, and lead were not significantly affected by the ash treatments, but cadmium tended to increase in the treatments with ash alone. From the fourth year onwards, the pH of the soil solution was lowered and the aluminum concentration raised in the plots given 9 Mg crushed ash.ha(-1). Fertilization with N alone temporarily increased concentrations of inorganic N, cadmium, aluminum, and zinc and decreased the pH. The crushed ash generally had longer lasting effects than N fertilization.

AB Increasing forest parcelization has raised concerns about tract-size economies and sustainable timber supply. We explored this issue by examining the logging sector and forest ownership in northern Wisconsin and Michigan's Upper Peninsula. Using 2004 survey data, we found that 48% of logging firms demonstrated a near exclusive reliance on nonindustrial private forests (NIPFs). NIPF-dependent firms derived 87.5% of their stumpage from this ownership, whereas nondependent firms exhibited a significantly more diversified stumpage supply distributed among public (42.6%), industrial-corporate (33.3%), and NIPF (24.0%) sources. Additionally, NIPF-dependent firms operated on significantly fewer, smaller, and less intensely harvested timber sales, and they were more likely to harvest small tracts profitably. There were no significant differences in the forest products harvested or overall firm profitability. We found statistical evidence that NIPF-dependent and nondependent firms organize themselves differently: NIPF dependency was negatively correlated with total number of employees, timberland area in the firm's wood basket, and firm location and positively correlated with owner age. Results suggest the impacts of parcelization on the logging sector are minimal. NIPF-dependent firms appear to have structured themselves to operate profitably; however, it is unclear how continued parcelization might influence these firms and the sector as a whole.

AB Alien invasive species pose a serious threat to the ecological and economic sustainability of Canada's forests. Recent establishments of invasive insect pests such as the brown spruce longhorn beetle (Tetropium fuscum), Asian longhorned beetle (Anoplophora glabripennis), and emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis) highlight the risk of alien species to natural and urban forests of Canada. An emerging area of phytosanitary concern for scientists and phytosanitary regulators is the relationship between fungi or other organisms (e.g., nematodes, mites) and their insect vectors. Invasive insects may introduce and vector alien fungal pests or may serve as vectors for native fungi. Conversely, native insects can become vectors of introduced fungi. The diversity of fungi vectored by introduced insect species is poorly understood. Canadian and international strategies to prevent the influx of alien invasive species, to monitor their presence, and to control established populations are discussed. Surveys for better understanding risks posed by vectored fungi will require development of novel survey techniques and diagnostic tools.

ID HEALTH RESEARCH
AB Background: There is a need to enhance the quality and sustainability of environmental health programs in Mexico. What socio-cultural factors influenced the adoption or rejection of Clean Water in Homes programs in this population? We applied rapid appraisal procedures (RAP) to evaluate these community-based programs.
   Method: Qualitative study conducted in communities along Mexico's northern border. We conducted informal dialogues, semi-structured interviews, field notes and observations. Home visits used a checklist to observe: sources of water, handwashing, as well as human waste and garbage disposal patterns.
   Data analysis was conducted using ATLAS.ti, which facilitated comparison and illustration of discrepancies, the elaboration of emerging issues and relationships between them.
   Results: Community members perceived that the Clean Water program was a top-down intervention. Water is perceived as a political issue and a matter of corruption. Inequity also limits solidarity activities involved in environmental sanitation. Migration to the United States of America (US) contributes to community fragmentation, which in turn dilutes communal efforts to improve water and sanitation infrastructure. While targeting women as program "recipients", the Clean Water program did not take gendered spheres of decision-making into account. Community members and authorities discussed the main results in "assemblies", particularly addressing the needs of excluded groups.
   Conclusion: The oversight of not exploring community members' needs and priorities prior to program implementation resulted in interventions that did not address the structural (economic, infrastructure) and socio-cultural barriers faced by community members to undertake the health-promoting behaviour change, and provoked resentment.

DT Article
ID PROGRAM SUSTAINABILITY; CAPACITY
AB Objective: The Canada-China Yunnan Maternal and Child Health Project (1997-2003) sought to improve the quality of village life and promote development of productivity and social prosperity in Yunnan province, China.
   Participants: The project targeted grassroots maternal and child health workers: new and in-service village doctors; traditional village midwives; doctors at township health centres; doctors at county maternal and child health hospitals; and provincial health staff.
   Setting: Ten impoverished counties (population 2.2 million) in Yunnan province with high proportions of ethnic minority populations.
   Intervention: There were three major innovations: training grassroots maternal and child health workers in participatory and community-based approaches and clinical skills; designing a model comprehensive referral system including provision of basic equipment; and introducing participatory monitoring and evaluation methods. Strategies to support sustainability were built into the project from the outset.
   Outcomes: Over 4,000 village, township, and county health workers received training. Maternal, infant, and under-five mortality rates declined over 30% in project counties. Project innovations were disseminated throughout the province, into other donor-funded initiatives, and integrated into national health projects by local partners.
   Conclusion: Maintaining the long-term benefits of international health interventions depends on sustaining innovations beyond short project timelines. Achieving sustainability poses a conundrum to implementing agencies. Three mechanisms influenced uptake in the Yunnan project: Maintaining a good fit between core project elements and the existing health system; developing adequate organizational supports; and creating a handover plan from the outset. This project highlights some of the ways in which sustainability can be operationalized.
   MeSH terms: China; public health; program sustainability; diffusion of innovation; community health planning; international cooperation.

AB Objective: To build a national Cuban capacity for training environmental health professionals directly linked to the needs of policy-makers and communities.
   Participants: The University of Manitoba and University of British Columbia collaborated with an established training centre in Cuba (the Instituto Nacional de Higiene y Epidemiologia - INHEM) and new centres in the Central (Santa Clara) and Eastern (Santiago) regions of the country.
   Setting: Cuba
   Intervention: In the mid-1990s, a comprehensive curriculum (masters and diploma programs) was collaboratively developed, applying interactive teaching methods, and was delivered through a series of workshops and other interactions in Cuba, and short-term visits to Canada by Cuban PhD students.
   Outcomes: The collaboration was successful in fulfilling capacity-building targets (over 50 Masters graduates, 467 Diploma graduates, over 30 trained core faculty in all regional centres as well as new curriculum and new accredited regional programs). Alongside this, a number of collaborative community-based research projects were undertaken in all three regions (drinking water in Santiago; housing and urban renewal, and dengue control in Havana; and tourism-related effects, and effective intersectoral management of population health determinants in Santa Clara).
   Conclusion: The collaboration led to adopting new strategies for challenges such as a dengue epidemic in 2002, and new research on the effectiveness of intersectoral management of risks of particular interest to both Cuban and Canadian policy-makers. It triggered an ambitious collaboration between the Canadian-Cuban team and colleagues in Ecuador in order to build a similar national network there, built on South-South and North-South links.

AB In tropical Africa, savannas occupy vast areas in the Sudanian region and in its transition to the Guineo-Congolian region. Various forms of human activities have increasingly disturbed these ecosystems over recent decades and ecological problems have evolved from the increasing exploitation of the natural resources. This paper examines the anthropogenic impact on the plant diversity, structure and phytomass of herbaceous to woody savannas in protected and exploited areas. A management perspective is proposed. The study sites were located in the Comoe National Park (CNP) and in the Korhogo town regions in the North of Ivory Coast. Several vegetation parameters were studied with standardised ecological methods on 19 surfaces of 1000 m(2). In both regions, the most important families in terms of the number of individuals were Fabaceae, Rubiaceae and Caesalpiniaceae. However, the plant diversity was twice as high at the species level in the CNR At Korhogo, there was a higher proportion of species from the other floral regions including the newly introduced species. In this region, the degradation of the vegetation became obvious by the absence or the low coverage of the upper strata in contrast to the CNP Basal area and biomass of the studied savanna plots in the CNP were higher than in the Korhogo region, showing the occurrence of a few large tree individuals contributing to the total biomass of a plot by up to 89%. In both regions, only the species protected (and used) in the local customs were represented by the old-growth individuals. The traditional protection by the local population reveals, in a relic form, the aspect of the vegetation before its exploitation; the eventual application of this type of protection, before establishing a reserve, will probably give the best result in the CNP. A complete protection of the areas that had been subjected to intensive coppice cutting may allow for a substantial restoration of the woody biomass. These facts may be used to increase for the local inhabitants' growing awareness of a more sustainable land management.

AB This study assessed the richness and abundance of Oligochaeta in two long-term experiments in Uruguay. In one experiment, located in eastern Uruguay (UEPP, INIA Treinta y Tres) we evaluated four different rotations (continuous cropping, short rotation, long rotation, and pasture improvement) under grazing and no tillage conditions. The rotations were compared with adjacent grazed natural grassland. In the other experiment, located in northern Uruguay (UEG, INIA Tacuarembo), we compared two natural grasslands, one under grazing and the other excluded it for 9 years. The community structure differed within the different agroecosystems. At UEPP-INIA Treinta y Tres, richness and abundance were significantly higher in the four crop-pasture rotations than in the natural grassland. Pasture improvement had the highest richness while continuous cropping showed the highest density. Species 1 (Family Ocnerodrilidae) was predominant at the continuous cropping, while sp.2 (Family Lumbricidae) was absent. Both species were recorded at the pasture improvement with similar densities. At UEG-INIA Tacuarembo there were no differences between treatments for richness and total abundance. Species 3 (Family Glossoscolecidae) was the only species affected by grazing. The indicator value index (IndVal) was computed for each species: sp.1 with a value of 39, and sp.2 with a value of 61. These species were associated to continuous cropping and pasture improvement, respectively and could be regarded as detector species. Species 3 with an IndVal value of 97 was associated to the ungrazed area at the UEG-INIA Tacuarembo, and should be regarded as a characteristic species.

AB Education, Research and Development Tasks of Environmental Protection. In the last decades considerable results of research was induced by environment protection; new areas of science were shaped and several technologies were introduced to economy. On the one hand, science receives challenges, on the other hand, it offers possibilities for sections. The increased demand for knowledge has grown at the same time considerably the social responsibility of the representatives of science, which comes from the fact that greater role is failing on scientists to ensure prosperous future to us. The environment's sciences have indisputable close connection with the spirituality, and the innovation of the environmental technologies are one of the most significant domain of the spirituality. The environment protection R&D activities of production organizations typically reflect this picture. The corporate research and technological development activities in environment protection are not limited to the independent R&D departments of the companies, but their relations are not clarified. It is also obvious that only these units could represent a guarantee for continuing any innovation activity. Consequently the production organisations also have a market interest in not to wind up or discontinue their activities to be carried out in order to ensure a long term sustainable development.

AB The Cellular Automata model FlySim was developed for simulating life and reproduction cycles of olive fruit flies (Bactrocera Oleae) and their behaviour, especially when they infest olive (Olea europaea) groves. This serious agricultural problem can be partially tackled in many ways, but not all the methods look sustainable, e.g., by using chemical agents at the first signs of the infestation. Sustainable solutions could be adopted with the use of interactive simulation tools in order to permit developing scenarios and testing different strategies. This paper outlines the model and exhibits a first partial application.

AB Coastal wetlands are important and fragile transitional environments for their ecological, hydrological. and conservation value. Yet, in the last 50 yr, they have been subject to a high level of anthropogenic disturbance, ranging from habitat disruption to pollution. Even important economic activities that directly or indirectly depend upon the ecological integrity of these unique environments, such as tourism, extensive fish farming, and clam rearing, may exert remarkable pressures on coastal lagoons. As a consequence, it is important to derive a methodology that allows for an integrated assessment of the ecological integrity of wetlands areas and the sustainability of the commercial activities that depend on it. In this work, we have defined a rapid, user friendly, and cost-effective tool to assess wetland condition based on an aggregated index of sustainability (ESI), which combines three scores targeted to quantifying habitat availability, functionality performance, and anthropogenic pressures, respectively. Three data forms have been compiled for 17 sites included in the LaguNet network, thus showing that (meta)data can be collected from a great deal of information coming from research centres, environmental agencies, grey literature, management bodies, and, in some cases, field surveys. A Monte Carlo sensitivity analysis has been performed to assess the sensitivity of the results to uncertainty or errors in the allocation of weights to the three components of the index. A randomization test applied to the 10 000 Monte Carlo replicates has allowed us to assess the robustness of the final ranking. The methodology presented here can be regarded as a cost-effective way to summarize a great deal of information and to provide a preliminary screening evaluation to help decision-makers in wetland assessment and management.

AB This essay focuses on the comparison between the recreational value of a natural beach area and the recreational value of a developed beach area nearby. Within the EU DELOS (2000-2003) framework. a survey by questionnaire was carried out in 2002 in Lido di Dante, a well-developed tourist resort in Italy. It consists of the application of the Contingent Valuation Method (CVM) in the value of enjoyment version (VOE) for assessing the non-marketable recreational use (Such as sunbathing, walking. and swimming) of the Lido di Dante beach areas in the status quo and in hypothetical scenarios of erosion and artificial defence. The project of defence from erosion, considered in this exercise, is paid with public funds. Foreigners were interviewed. It is highlighted that the recreational value in the situation of erosion is lower than that of the status quo, and that the individual loss of enjoyment would be considerable, while the implementation of the project would give a mean gain. Among the explanatory variables of the recreational beach use, the beach quality ratings seem to be important, while income is not significant when it is specified. The comparison of the values for the different beach areas highlights that in Lido di Dante, the daily use value in Euros of the natural beach area is higher than that of the developed beach area. This case study shows that, front a recreational point of view. investing in a natural area is successful and that a sustainable coastal development requires defence projects to be selected also in order to preserve biodiversity.

AB This authoritative report provides a unique insight into the materials flow of Platinum Group Metals (PGMs) within a major industrialised economy; Germany. Researched and compiled by two of Germany's most respected organisations, Umicore and the Oko-Institut, it comprehensively examines each of the major application areas for PGMs, provides an in-depth assessment of gross demand and assesses the extent to which this is satisfied by recycling. Furthermore, the report Provides a detailed review of prevailing recycling structures and evaluates their relative effectiveness in terms of efficiency, opportunities for improvement and sustainable optimisation. This research was sponsored by Germany's Federal Ministry of Education & Research. Although this report is a case study of the situation in Germany, it also serves as an invaluable reference for the PGM industry worldwide. The results of the analysis and its discussion of the issues will find resonance in many other countries and in numerous industries. In particular, its insights into the whole subject of PGM recycling shed new light on this highly complex area and will be of key importance to all market participants from mining companies and industrial users to refiners, fabricators, banks and traders. This executive summary has been authored by the London based precious metals consultancy GFMS Limited and sets out the key elements of the report.

TI China's pattern of growth: Moving to sustainability and reducing

SO CHINA & WORLD ECONOMY
LA English
DT Article
DE income inequality; labor productivity; labor relocation; pattern of
   growth
AB This paper uses both macro level and sectoral data to study the sources and pattern of China's impressive economic growth over the last 25 years. Extending the growth accounting framework, we show that widening inequality, rural poverty, and resource intensity are to a large extent rooted in China growth strategy, and resolving them requires a rebalancing of policies. We find that growth of investment in the industrial sector has been the single most important factor driving gross domestic product and overall labor productivity growth since the early 1990s. The shift of labor from low-productivity agriculture has been limited. The productivity gap between agriculture and the rest of the economy has continued to widen, leading to increased rural-urban income inequality. Continuing with the current growth pattern would further increase already high investment and saving needs to unsustainable levels, lower urban employment growth, and widen the rural-urban income gap. However, reducing subsidies to industry and investment, encouraging the development of the services industry, and reducing barriers to labor mobility would result in a more balanced growth and a substantial reduction in the income gap between rural and urban residents.

   pension system reform; sustainability
AB This paper reviews the development of the urban and rural old age security system in China, and discusses the challenges in the process of constructing a sustained old age security system. Although funding gaps and empty individual accounts have imposed a heavy burden on the sustainability of China's urban pension system, there is a relatively high coverage rate of 35.3 percent for urban workers. However, China's pension system provides low coverage rate for rural farmers. The more rapidly aging population and lower incomes in rural areas pose challenges to the vulnerable rural household support system. The separation of the old age security system between rural and urban areas also puts great pressure as a result of urbanization on farmers who lose their farmland. Therefore, it is urgent for China to speed up the reform of its old age security system to provide an institutional support for its economic and social transition.

AB The paper introduces a methodology for process chain planning that is based on the optimisation of technological interfaces and uses multi-criteria optimisation techniques. The manufacturing of helical car-gearings including precision forging technology was investigated as a reference for validation. An employment of modern materials and technologies is often not sufficient for an optimisation of entire process chains. In the future, technological and computational integration of alternative production technologies will be decisive for long-term success. This integration can be seen as an important step towards sustainable process chain optimisation. Having this in mind, the positioning of technological interfaces has been addressed by scientists at Hannover University.

SO CLIMATE POLICY
LA English
DT Article
DE Kyoto Protocol; policy architecture; clean development mechanism;
   developing countries; participation; mitigation
AB This article introduces and explores a new form of international commitment to limit greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, called an action target. Action targets differ from other forms of targets, such as the Kyoto Protocol's fixed targets, in that they define a quantity of GHG abatement to be achieved, rather than a future emission level to be reached. This article explains the basic mechanics of how action targets might operate, and analyses the approach across a range of criteria, including uncertainty management and contributions to sustainable development in non-Annex I (developing) countries. The analysis suggests that action targets might improve the prospects of widening and deepening developing country participation in the international climate regime.

AB From the view of one of the largest public health insurance companies, in this paper it is outlined that Integrated Health Care provides opportunities to influence the largely regional structures of health care supply. This insurance company has specialized in contracts for Integrated Health Care in cardiology in order to achieve sustainable solutions for all providers of invasive and interventional cardiology that are economically reasonable. But first of all, only evidence-based medical procedures and interventions based on clinical pathways are eligible for the contracts of this company. In outlining this, it becomes evident that by far not all German public health insurance companies have yet used their opportunity.

AB Sustainability is an elusive pursuit. But coastal poverty is a pervasive and debilitating reality for many coastal communities and the coastal management literature provides little explicit direction for tackling poverty. How then can a more people-centred, pro-poor Integrated Coastal Management approach be developed and implemented? The Sustainable Livelihoods approach provides a complementary analytical framework for understanding the nature of poverty and the challenges and opportunities for building sustainable coastal livelihoods. This approach has guided aspects of South Africa's coastal policy implementation effort. This experience exposes significant challenges that must be faced in converting sustainability rhetoric into practical reality and reveals lessons for confronting the underlying drivers of coastal poverty. Ultimately, a people-centred, pro-poor approach must empower poor coastal communities to pursue the mercurial ideal of coastal sustainability through practical, locally relevant interventions.

   international law best note award winner
SO COLUMBIA JOURNAL OF TRANSNATIONAL LAW
LA English
DT Article
AB Across the Nile River Basin in East Africa, water supplies have become increasingly scarce and political stability has historically depended on equitable access to natural resources. In this context, the international goals of sustainable development and poverty reduction are dependent upon the formation of a reliable framework for governance of the region's most important natural resource-the water supply of the Nile River. However, the dominant legal structure for allocations of the Nile's water is still primarily shaped by the colonially imposed and outdated Nile Waters Agreements signed in 1929 and 1959. As Nile basin states question the validity of this regime and respond to urgent national water and development needs, an analysis of these agreements and their alternatives is necessary in order to maintain stability across the region. This Note examines the historical and legal backgrounds of modem Nile River governance and proposes the formation of a new, "ground-up" approach to a comprehensive legal framework regulating the basin states' use of the Nile.

ID CROPPING SYSTEMS; AMMONIUM; NUTRITION; QUALITY; PLANTS
AB Resource conservation with respect to nitrogen (N) was compared in organic and conventional cultivation of winter and spring wheat. Sustainability was measured in the nitrogen use efficiency of plant-available N. The amounts of N entering each system and the amounts removed in the harvested crop and remaining as unused mineral nitrogen in the soil at harvest were determined. Net surpluses and losses during the growing season were also monitored, and the environmental variables influencing N harvest in the different cultivation systems were identified. The study was carried out in three different cultivation systems: conventional animal production (CONV), organic animal production (ORG1), and organic cereal production (ORG2). On average for all years and sampling occasions in winter wheat, there were approximately 60 kg more mineral nitrogen left in the soil during the growing season in CONV than in ORG1, and coefficients of variation were higher in CONV. The maximum values were considerably higher in CONV than in ORG1 ( p =0.06-0.09), which increased the risk of leaching in the former, particularly in winter wheat cultivation. Nitrogen use efficiency in winter and spring wheat cultivation was 74% in whole crop conventional winter wheat and 81% in organic. Nitrogen use efficiency in harvested winter wheat grain was 44% for CONV and 49% for ORG1. ORG1 spring wheat was as efficient as ORG1 winter wheat, whereas ORG2 spring wheat used 73% of N in the whole crop and 39% in grain. Multivariate regression analysis showed that climate affected CONV and ORG1 winter wheat differently. High temperature in May increased grain yields in ORG1, but the converse was true for CONV. Large unused mineral N reserves at harvest coincided with large N harvest in CONV winter wheat. Residual fertility effects from the preceding crop produced high yields in ORG1 winter and spring wheat but had no effect in CONV. Generally, an increase in N reserves between plant development stages 13 and 31 was positive for both CONV and ORG1 winter wheat. Both winter and spring wheat require most N during this period, so the potential for improvement seems to lie in increasing mineralization (e.g., by intensified weed harrowing early in stage 13 in winter wheat and between stages 13 and 31 in spring wheat). Cultivation of winter wheat in ORG1 was a more efficient use of nitrogen resources than CONV. CONV efficiency could be improved by precision fertilization on each individual field with the help of N analysis before spring tillage and sensor-controlled fertilization.

AB Potassium (K) fixation and release in soil are important issues in long-term sustainability of a cropping system. Fixation and release behavior of potassium were studied in the surface and subsurface horizons in five benchmark soil series, viz. Dhar, Gurdaspur, Naura, Ladowal, and Nabha, under rice-wheat cropping system in the Indo-Gangetic plains of India. Potassium fixation was noted by adding six rates of K varying from 0 to 500 mg kg(-1) soil in plastic beaker,,; while K release characteristics were studied by repeated extractions with 1 M HNO3 and 1 M NH4OAc extractants. The initial status of K was satisfactory to adequate. Potassium fixation of added K increased with the rate of added K irrespective of soil mineralogy and soil depth. Soils rich in K (Ladowal and Nabha) fixed lower amounts (18-42%) of added K as compared to Gurdaspur, Dhar, and Naura (44.6-86.4%) soils low in K. The unit fertilizer requirement for unit increase in available K was more in low-K soils. The study highlights the need for more studies on K fixation in relation to the associated minerals in a particular soil. Potassium-release parameters such as total extractable K, total step K, and CR-K varied widely in different soil series, indicating wide variation in the K-supplying capacity of these soils. K released with I M NH4OAc extractant was 20-33% of that obtained with I M HNO3. Total extractable K using 1 M HNO3 varied from 213 to 528 mg kg(-1) and NH4OAc-extractable K ranged from 71 to 312 mg kg(-1) soil in surface and subsurface layers of different soil series. The Ladowal and Nabha series showed higher rates of K release than Gurdaspur, Dhar, and Naura series, indicating their greater K-supplying capacity.

AB Wastewater treatment with reactive filters and recycling the phosphorus (P)-saturated materials as fertilizers in plant production is a suitable concept for a sustainable society. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the ability of the Hedley P fractionation scheme to separate different P fractions, including inorganic and organic P, in soils and sorbent materials used to reduce the P content of waste water. An additional aim was to determine changes in P fractions after storage for 8 months under different humidity regimes. This was to evaluate whether extractability of P is dependent on storage conditions between sorption of P and the subsequent use of the sorbent materials as P fertilizers. This study is the first one showing that in sorbent materials used for treatment of wastewater, the Hedley fractionation scheme separated Ca phosphates in the HCl extract from Al and Fe phosphates in the NaOH extract. The different fractions could also be used to characterize soils of different origins, to separate liming treatments, and to approximately document soil P fertility, but could not assess differences in soil P status caused by different P fertilization in a single year. No significant influence of moisture regimes during storage on resin-exchangeable P was detected. This increases the suitability of the studied sorbent materials for recycling P from wastewater to agricultural crops, because it indicates that plant availability of sorbed P does not change drastically during the studied storage conditions.

AB Soil organic matter (SOM) is an important indicator for soil quality and sustainable agriculture, and agricultural practices may strongly affect SOM content and chemistry. Thus, a long-term experiment was conducted in northeast China to study the effect of chemical fertilizers and recycled organic manure on the contents of SOM along its fractions of black soil (0 - 20-cm depth). Eight treatments were used: 1) control, 2) recycled organic manure ( ROM), 3) nitrogen (N) alone, 4) N + ROM, 5) N + phosphorous (P), 6) N + P + ROM, 7) N + P + potassium (K), and 8) N + P + K + ROM. The results showed that from 1985 to 2002; soil total organic carbon (TOC) decreased by 6.5% over the 18 years in control (33.25 g/kg in 1985), 5.6% in ROM treatment, and 5.1% in N-alone treatment, and 1.5% in the N + P treatment but increased by 0.3% in the N + P + K treatment. In the three treatments of chemical fertilizers together with ROM (i.e., N = ROM, N = P + ROM, and N + P + K + ROM), soil TOC content in 2002 increased by 0.3%, 1.3%, and 2.8%, respectively, when compared with control in 1985. Compared with control in 2002, light fraction organic carbon ( LFOC) content increased by 23% in N + ROM treatment, 24% in N + P + ROM, and 28% in N + P + K + ROM, and readily oxidized carbon (ROC) content increased by 24% 31%, and 39%, respectively, in these three treatments. The ROC was well correlated with soil TOC. Compared with the data from 18 years ago, in all eight treatments organic carbon of soil in the humic acid fraction decreased by 5.0 - 13% and in fulvic acid decreased by 1.4 - 14%; however, with chemical fertilizers and ROM applied together, the rate of decrease was reduced. Overall, ROM is effective for increasing the content of soil TOC and thus, its different active carbon fractions in black soil would help to maintain or increase soil productivity.

AB Alfalfa pasture has not been sustainable on the coastal plain of the United States because of its intolerance to soil acidity. This study examined the responses of alfalfa metabolism to differential amendments of acid soil and to serial harvesting. The soil was spatially amended with different quantities of flue gas desulfurization sludge and gypsum after liming to pH 7. The serial harvests oscillated the RNA synthetic activity of glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) from an oxidized to a reduced state irrespective of the soil amendments. The amplitudes of the redox cycles changed from one harvest to the next, thus demonstrating improved regrowth persistence. The chlorophyll, hexose, nucleotide, and protein contents, and the fructose-1, 6-bisphosphatase activity, decreased and fluctuated inconsistently in the successive cuttings. Consideration of the metabolic responses per harvest showed that the alfalfa had optimized saccharide metabolism in the first harvest, optimized RNA metabolism in the second harvest, optimized saccharide and RNA metabolism in the third harvest, and depressed saccharide metabolism in the fourth harvest, thereby optimizing the regrowth potential of the alfalfa pasture. Sustainability of the pasture was conferred by the coordinate compensatory regulation of metabolism in response to the synergistic interaction between the differential amendments and the nitrogen (N) nutrient excreted by the alfalfa into the soil.

AB The networks of 15 international research centers around the globe that are sponsored by the Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) seeks to alleviate poverty in the developing world through enhanced production, while maintaining biodiversity and the sustainability of natural resources. The mandate of the International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA) is to focus on improving semi-arid cropping systems in the drought-prone West Asia and North Africa region. Since its inception in 1997, ICARDA's soil laboratory played a pivotal role in backstopping the institution's on-station and on-farm research in Syria and its collaborative research with the region's national programs. This article gives an overview of the evolution of soil and plant analysis in serving the center's mission. A major effort was the regional soil test calibration program, which set the basis for rational use of fertilizers and the identification of related nutrient constraints. Such analyses were extensively employed in all the long-term dryland cropping system trials and later in irrigated agriculture and the interface between plant nutrition and crop breeding. Major emphasis was given to improving and upgrading analytical services in the region's laboratories. Despite advances made in analytical methodology, the challenge is to apply to solving real problems in the service of humanity.

AB Soil microorganisms drive nutrients cycling to a great extent, and they play an essential role in maintaining a stable soil ecosystem and ensuring sustainable forestry development. Land management has been proven to be a real factor in influencing soil quality. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of different land management techniques on soil microbial communities. There were four types of land management systems selected for this study: natural masson pine, Phyllostachy pubescens, Phyllostachys praecox, and vegetable. Soils were sampled from these four systems and assayed for soil microbial biomass carbon (MBC), community level substrate utilization pattern, functional diversity, and principle component analysis. Values of MBC were significantly different (P < 0.05) from one another in the order of masson pine > Phyllostachy pubescens > Phyllostachys Praecox > vegetable. Analysis of community level substrate utilization pattern indicated that carbon source utilization and total activity by soil microorganisms were greater under the masson pine system than the other three systems (P < 0.01). The functional diversities of soil microbial communities characterized as Shannon and McIntosh indexes were much richer in soil under masson pine system; Shannon index was 4.483, 4.241, 4.224, and 3.938 and McIntosh index was 13.51, 7.332, 6.272, and 6.261 for natural masson pine, Phyllostachy pubescens. Phyllostachys praecox, and vegetable systems, respectively. The results from the principle components analysis (PCA), based on the data of optical density (OD) at 120 h of incubation, showed that the value of the first principal component (PC1) of soil for natural masson pine was greater (P < 0.05) than those for the other three systems. The difference in scores of the second principal component (PC2) between Phyllostachy pubescens, Phyllostachys praecox, and vegetable were not statistically different. The size and activity of soil microbial communities generally decreased with soil depth, with significant differences in soil MBC, community level substrate utilization pattern, and functional diversity indexes found between A and C horizons (P < 0.01). It was concluded that land management systems had a great influence on soil microbial biomass, activity, and functional diversity.

AB Long-term agricultural sustainability and water quality are impacted by different chemicals, including heavy metals. Heavy-metal losses at the catchment scale depend largely on land-management practices. Water-Equality indicators are required near soil-Equality indicators for different regions and farming systems. The purpose of this work is to analyze the heavy-metal losses from a mixed agroforestry catchment. Iron (Fe), Magnesium (Mn), Zinc (Zn), and Copper (Cu) were measured in the drainage water of a 36.3 km(2) catchment located at the Vali (n) over tilde as River (Coru (n) over tildea, northwest Spain), and a total of 193 samples were collected during the course of 2003. The sampling strategy was a stratified point sampling involving more frequent sampling when flow was high. Water metal content was analyzed by inductively coupled plasma (ICP-EAES). The content ranges of dissolved heavy metals were as follows: Fe between 10 and 267 mu g/L, Mn 0.2 and 77 mu g/L, Zn 0.62 and 53.7 mu g/L, and Cu 0.20 and 9.26 mu g/L. Heavy metal content strongly varied along the study time, depending on storm flow but also on timing of animal-waste applications.

ID NUTRIENT MANAGEMENT
AB At the moment, Hungarian agriculture is confronted with a certain duality as far as nutrients are concerned. On the one hand, national soil nutrient balances show substantial deficits, and on the other hand, agricultural nutrient use is responsible for a part of the nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) losses to the environment. To understand this duality and help optimize farm nutrient management, the farm gate N and P balances of 12 farms, representing a variety of Hungarian agriculture, were calculated for the year 2002. The farm gate N and P surpluses/deficits in the east of the country were lower than in the west. This was correlated with a lower fertilization rate. The low soil fertility level due to a prolonged period of low fertilization in combination with continuing nutrient deficits can lead to possible future reduction in crop yields.

AB Long-term field experiments are the most suitable tools for determining the optimal nutrient-supplying technologies that contribute to sustainable agriculture. Under certain environmental conditions (low precipitation, deep groundwater table, negative water balance), part of the applied nitrogen (N) can be found in the soil profile for a longer period and provide N nutrition for crops. A long-term field experiment has been running at Nagyhorcsok in Hungary since 1973. The nitrogen Cophosphorus Copotassium (NPK) application rates follow the overall nutrient-supplying categories (weak, medium, adequate, excessive) by the main nutrients and their combinations. The seasonal dynamics of exchangeable NH4 and NO3 were followed in 1983 and 2003. From certain treatments, two parallel average samples (20-20 subsamples were mixed to get average composite samples by plots) were collected 19 times from March through November from three soil layers. There was no difference in NH4-N between years, and its seasonal fluctuation was slight in both years, whereas there was an increase in NO3-N in accordance with the applied N rates. No significant difference occurred in the NO3-N of the N-0 < P0K0 and the N1P1K1 treatments during both years. A significantly higher NO3-N content was observed in the higher rate nutrient treatments. Both soil N forms were higher in 1983 than in 2003. Based on the experimental results, the fate and behavior of the surplus N in the soil can be characterized and the residual amount can be taken into account during the calculation of the N-fertilization demand of arable crops in relation to the N-fertilizer advisory system.

AB Sulfur mortars and concretes are high performance composite materials whose main properties are quick setting, high strength, low water absorption and high resistance to acid and basic environments. In addition, such materials allow to use the big amount of sulfur coming from worldwide oil refineries and metallurgical industry.
   The possibility of using three different by-products coming from raw materials treatment for ceramic industry in sulfur composites has been investigated in this paper. Mechanical properties, microstructure and durability of the sulfur mortars prepared with the above mentioned recycled aggregates have been investigated and compared with those of the relevant mortars samples obtained with normalised sand and cement according to UNI EN 196-1.

AB Global marketplace and intense competition in the business environment lead organizations to focus on selecting the best R&D project portfolio among available projects using their scarce resources in the most effective manner. This happens to be a sine qua non for high technology firms to sharpen their competitive advantage and realize long-term survival with sustainable growth. To accomplish that, firms should take into account both the uncertainty inherent in R&D using appropriate valuation techniques accounting for flexibility in making investment decisions and all possible interactions between the candidate projects within an optimization framework. This paper provides a fuzzy optimization model for dealing with the complexities and uncertainties regarding the construction of an R&D project portfolio. Real options analysis, which accounts for managerial flexibility, is employed to correct the deficiency of traditional discounted cash flow valuation that excludes any form of flexibility. An example is provided to illustrate the proposed decision approach.

AB Companies have to shorten the innovation cycle for products to obtain a competitive advantage. Thus not only time to market but also time for developing new products has to be reduced. Due to that several software tools are used to facilitate a computer based product synthesis. One of them is a Product Data Management System (PDMS) for the integration and administration of all kind of CAx-data. With dedicated data transfer, information processing methods and self-generating assembly sequences it is possible to shorten the time between the arrangement drawing, part production and final assembly to a few moments. Because of a continuous data model it is even possible to transmit data backward in the product creation process. The information can be used as rules for an engineering workbench or for the visualization of the progress. Consequently a PDMS as an information feed-back control system can realize a more robust and sustainable product synthesis.

DE mining; Melanesia; Papua New Guinea; minerals policy; social change
AB This introduction contextualizes the discussion of community responses to mining in Melanesia by looking first at the policies of minerals extraction and the shift of academic interest from economic development to the social effects of mining. As this collection concentrates on Papua New Guinea, an analysis of the sector and its problems in that country is briefly contrasted with the situation in other Pacific Island nations, canvassing the idea that the economic "resource curse" might have a social dimension. The varying interpretations of local impact and anthropological studies have challenged notions of unified interest or consensus at the local level, revealing ambivalence and contradictions. An overview of the contributions made in this special issue to current debates about stakeholder interests and economic sustainability is presented, showing that understandings of mining and its social consequences at each stage of the process are always inflected by the cultural conceptions of change, wealth, and resources that obtain in a community.

AB Mineral development in remote parts of the world has become a major focus of environmental and social resistance movements. Despite the economic benefits that may accrue for local people, the impact of such projects is increasingly being questioned, particularly by indigenous communities. However, there are ways by which amicable and effective resolutions to development disagreements can be achieved despite cultural differences between the developer and the community. Using qualitative research methods, this article presents a comparative analysis of two mining projects on the Pacific island of New Caledonia where the indigenous Kanak community has shown differentiation in their response to the two projects. Our analysis shows that the project encountering less resistance has more effectively embraced principles of transparency, flexibility, and indigenous ownership. Our analysis suggests that mineral developers operating on indigenous lands should consider the power of process in reaching agreements rather than erroneously assuming that litigation or buyouts are inevitable. Such an approach is likely to reach more sustainable solutions to development in remote indigenous communities.

AB We have examined the caudal regions of diverse peracarid and pancarid malacostracans using light and scanning electronic microscopy. The traditional view of malacostracan posterior anatomy is not sustainable, viz., that the free telson, when present, bears the, anus near the base. The anus either can occupy a terminal, sub-terminal, or mid-ventral position on the telson; or can be located on the sixth pleomere - even when a free telson is present. Furthermore, there is information that might be interpreted to suggest that in some cases a telson can be absent. Embryologic data indicates that the condition of the body terminus in amphipods cannot be easily characterized, though there does appear to be at least a transient seventh segment that seems to fuse with the sixth segment. Our understanding of the genesis of the so-called telson of amphipods could be subject to alternative interpretations than those traditionally put forth.

AB Since from the 1980s, computer science and artificial intelligence have focused on environmental planning, with high interest in analysing real and virtual cognitive agents at work. This is true for procedures, long-range planning, operational planning, as well as factors and scenarios of future events, future risks, multi-agent organisation, and resource-based planning.
   This long-range, large-scale, strategy-driven interest has generally prevented short-term planning, low-scale and detailed planning from being explored with an intelligent-planning approach. This paper shows a case of small-scale inner-city planning for environmental and development issues in an urban context, with a sustainably sound approach.
   In this concern, a system architecture has been set up, to support the interaction of local social, economic, financial agents by a web-based geographic interface able to visualize, share, channel substantial information in the planning process with a space-based approach. The details of setup methodologies and results are analyzed, trying to find potentials and critical characters of a georeferenced cooperative work, particularly attentive to the role of space-based cognitions and discourses in multi-agent interactions.

AB Irrigated pastures form a significant component of agriculture in the irrigated steppe of the southern Rocky Mountains, USA. Information is limited, however, describing performance of grazed binary perennial cool-season grass-legume mixtures in the region. Established monoculture tall fescue [Festuca arundinacea Schreb. = Lolium arundinaceum (Schreb.) SJ. Darbyshire] + 134 kg N ha(-1) (MONO) and tall fescue mixed with alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) (ALF/TF), birdsfoot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus L.) (BFT/TM, deer milkvetch (Astragalus cicer L.) (CM/TM), or kura clover (Trifolium ambiguum M.B.) (KC/TF) at New Mexico State University's Sustainable Agriculture Science Center at Alcalde were subjected to two grazing frequencies (grazed monthly or bimonthly mid-May to mid-September) from 1998 to 2000. Grass, legume, and combined dry matter (DM) yields were measured in May 11998 to 2001. A year X grazing frequency X pasture interaction for legume DM yield was moderated by a lack of effect in grass DM yield, leaving a year X pasture interaction for combined DM yield in which MONO, ALF/TF, and CM/TF increased linearly across years and cubic trends were exhibited by ALF/TF and KC/TF Despite the cubic trend of KC/TF it and BFT/TF had the most uniform yield distribution across years because of nonsignificant linear effects. Annual combined DM yield averaged 2.21, 3.90, 2.43, 1.93, and 3.03 Mg ha(-1) for MONO, ALF/TF, BFT/TF, CM/TF, and KC/TF, respectively, from 1998 to 2001 (5% LSD = 0.77). Kura clover-tall fescue offers an alternative to alfalfa-tall fescue for long-term pastures in the irrigated steppe of the southern Rocky Mountains.

   ADDITIONS; AMINES; SALTS; ACID
AB Gas - solid and stoichiometric solid - solid reactions are usually quantitative and waste-free and thus particularly sustainable and environmentally benign. It is therefore shown how these can be scaled up with an emphasis for their use in chemical production. There is no necessity for purifying workup with solvent consumption ( that means real solvent-freeness), waste disposal and other excessive energy input. These techniques avoid auxiliaries such as solvents, supports and catalysts, but the latter may be applied as gases with easy removal after reaction. Heat development is usually not a problem. Heat removal can be handled and is described also for extreme cases, as is the availability of equipment, in particular suitable milling techniques. The solid-state mechanism, which involves phase rebuilding ( anisotropic molecular migrations within crystals), phase transformation and crystal disintegration, is the basics for the technical design. If ( intermediate) melting cannot be avoided by cooling below eutectic temperatures, melt reactions at higher temperatures than required for solid-state reactions can be also rapid, uniform and quantitative, when direct crystallization of the product occurs. This version has an increased risk for side reactions as it does not profit from the crystal packing of the starting materials, but it profits from the crystal structure of the high melting product. For preparative purposes "large-scale'' starts with the kg-range that can be easily reached in research institutes. It provides the basics for further scale up in industrial environments. Numerous typical examples are given for organic and some inorganic syntheses. These include solvent-free salt formations, complexations, condensations of amines, heterocyclic syntheses, Knoevenagel condensations, cascade reactions, halogen additions, stereo- and regio-specific protective reactions, and redox reactions. All of these may be of technical importance. Some of these involve now easily obtained products that cannot be achieved by solution reactions.

AB An image can be decomposed into different elementary descriptors depending on the observer interest. Similar techniques as used to understand words, regarded as molecules, formed by combining atoms, are proposed to describe images based on their information content. In this paper, we use primitive feature extraction and clustering to code the image information content. Our purpose is to describe the complexity of the information based on the combinational profile of the clustered primitive features using entropic measures like mutual information and Kullback-Leibler divergence. The developed method is demonstrated to asses image complexity for further applications to improve Earth Observation image analysis for sustainable humanitarian crisis response in risk reduction.

AB The increasing rate of motorization in major urban centers in Asia is having severe impacts on local social and physical environments. Sustainability principles call for consideration of these traffic impacts, which include congestion, air and noise pollution, road safety, and urban decay, in the evaluation of urban development programs and projects. This study aims to contribute to the scarce literature on valuing nonmonetary external costs of traffic in developing countries through the attribute-based stated choice method measuring willingness to pay for route environment improvements. A web-based stated preference route choice survey was conducted regarding private work trips in metro Manila, Philippines, to value the welfare derived from changes in the quality of road and roadside environments. The authors estimated and compared values from specifications of fixed and random parameter logit. This study shows that estimates are sensitive to model specification, particularly if the attributes have significant preference heterogeneity and covariance. The values of significant attributes affecting utility, which include the value of percentage improvement in air quality, the value of percentage reduction in noise, and the risk value from a traffic fatality, are presented and compared.

TI Trajectories for greening in china: Theory and practice
SO DEVELOPMENT AND CHANGE
LA English
DT Article
ID RISK SOCIETY; DYNAMICS; NGOS
AB This edited volume argues that China's development poses the greatest ever environmental challenge for the modern world in terms of speed, size and scarcity. The volume is organized around the greening of the Chinese state and society: can the inclusion of sustainable development principles into governance, management and daily practices by social actors lead to sustainable development per se ? This introduction sketches the different scholarly camps around greening and sustainable development, ranging from sceptical to radical environmentalism. The contributions demonstrate that China is showing clear signs of greening as new institutions and regulations are created, environmental awareness increases and green technologies are implemented. However, the question remains whether this is sufficient to effectuate long-term sustainable development. The key factors here are the sheer speed of China's economic growth, the size of its population, and the relative scarcity of its natural and mineral resources. Chinese development presents compelling reasons for rethinking the viability of greening. It is necessary to move beyond both alarmist visions of an environmental doomsday, and optimistic notions that incremental changes in technology, institutions and lifestyles are sufficient for sustainability. It might be more fruitful - and not only for China - to consider 'precautionary' rather than 'absolute' limits to growth.

TI Implementation of Chinese environmental law: Regular enforcement and
   political campaigns
SO DEVELOPMENT AND CHANGE
LA English
DT Article
ID SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; STATE
AB While China has made great strides in establishing environmental laws and enforcing environmental regulation, problems of non-compliance and weak and slow enforcement remain. This contribution analyses cases of sub-optimum enforcement and the political campaigns that have been undertaken to deal with them. It will argue that enforcement problems are rooted in a lack of local legitimacy caused by conflicting interests of stakeholders. The case of Chinese environmental law enforcement holds lessons beyond its regional scope, about the role of law in balancing interests. Law itself does not exist in a vacuum: on the contrary, it is very much the result of conflicting interests and can be seriously challenged by the need to balance these interests. The use of political campaigns to enhance enforcement in China shows that the flexibility of political short-term policy instruments can offer incremental improvements to enhance the balance between the conflicting interests themselves and their relation with the legal system.

TI A market road to sustainable agriculture? Ecological agriculture, green
   food and organic agriculture in China
SO DEVELOPMENT AND CHANGE
LA English
DT Article
ID ENVIRONMENT; ECONOMY; REFORM; POLICY
AB To the extent that free markets show little concern for the existence of externalities, they are unlikely to produce optimum outcomes with regard to the protection and enhancement of the natural environment. Accordingly, the increasing emphasis on markets to deliver development in China under Deng Xiaoping and his successors has the capacity to threaten the long-term environmental sustainability of that development. While there are good reasons to remain sceptical about the ability of market mechanisms to promote sustainable rural development in many respects, market reforms in China and the opening of the country to the outside world have nevertheless provided opportunities for farmers to engage in ecologically sensitive agriculture in the form of 'green' food and organic farming. Given that these forms of agriculture reduce farmers' use of chemicals compared to conventional farming - chemicals which are costly to produce and environmentally degrading to use - they contribute to ensuring a more environmentally sustainable future for Chinese farming, post-WTO entry, whilst providing opportunities for farmers to enrich themselves at the same time: a 'win-win' state of affairs. This will remain the case, however, only so long as the state is prepared to create and reinforce appropriate institutional arrangements.

TI Mobile education in autopsy conferences of pathology: presentation of
   complex cases
SO DIAGNOSTIC PATHOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Background: MeduMobile was a project to develop and evaluate learning scenarios for medical students and teachers by use of video communication and notebooks. Its core part was assigned to various medical routines, conferences or meetings such as doctor-patient bedside conversation. These were filmed by video teams and broadcasted live via the WLAN of the Charite campus to course participating students. One type of the learning arrangements was the autopsy conference as an on-call scenario.
   Materials and methods: The MeduMobile project consisted of two main compartments: the regular seminar event which took place every week or month, and the on-call event. For an on-call event the students were informed two hours before the lesson's start. A mobile video team organised the video conference via a specific MeduMobile seminar system. This software offered the students to log. The MeduMobile seminar system is based on the Windows operating system and realises an extended video communication via WLAN. Thirteen access points were implemented at the Charite Campus Virchow Klinikum and Campus Mitte. A questionnaire was developed to investigate in the response and learning effect of the mobile seminar system.
   Results: During the MeduMobile project 42 video conferences with (cumulative) 145 participating students took place. Four autopsy conferences could be organised as on-call scenarios within this project. A prospective, not randomised follow-up study was included 25 students of the 1(st)-6(th) clinical semester. According to the answers, professional reasoning, professional performance, sustainability, and the complexity were broadly accepted by the students.
   Discussion: In principle, the MeduMobile realised an interdisciplinary case presentation using video conference and web page. The evaluation indicates a high acception of such complex case presentation with multidisciplinary settings. The use of the notebooks in mobile learning enables an interconnective training and promotes a complex learning.

DE place attachment; second home; coastal settlements; residential

AB The paper analyses the concept of place attachment in the context of second home. Contemporary society is characterised by structural changes in the field of work and leisure, resulting in increasing mobility and travelling. Place attachment is analysed in comparison with current social issues such as globalisation, mobility, leisure, tourism, social sustainable planning. Changes within the process of territorialisation, especially in the forming of residential strategies have been emphasized in the paper. The bipolar model of residential strategies is transformed to multiple homes. The research was conducted on a sample of residential home owners on the Croatian Adriatic coast (N=400). The results show a high degree of attachment to second home, as well as a high level of identification with place. Based on this, the results indicate a tendency of changing the concept from second house to second home.

AB Instrumental climate records suggest that summer precipitation and winter snowpack in Glacier National Park ( Glacier NP), Montana, vary significantly over decadal to multidecadal time scales. Because instrumental records for the region are limited to the twentieth century, knowledge of the range of variability associated with these moisture anomalies and their impacts on ecosystems and physical processes are limited. The authors developed a reconstruction of summer ( June - August) moisture variability spanning A. D. 1540 - 2000 from a multispecies network of tree-ring chronologies in Glacier NP. Decadal-scale drought and pluvial regimes were defined as any event lasting 10 yr or greater, and the significance of each potential regime was assessed using intervention analysis. Intervention analysis prevents single intervening years of average or opposing moisture conditions from ending what was otherwise a sustained moisture regime. The reconstruction shows numerous decadal-scale shifts between persistent drought and wet events prior to the instrumental period ( before A. D. 1900). Notable wet events include a series of three long-duration, high-magnitude pluvial regimes spanning the end of the Little Ice Age ( A. D. 1770 - 1840). Though the late-nineteenth century was marked by a series of > 10 yr droughts, the single most severe dry event occurred in the early-twentieth century ( A. D. 1917 - 41). These decadal-scale dry and wet events, in conjunction with periods of high and low snowpack, have served as a driver of ecosystem processes such as forest fires and glacial dynamics in the Glacier NP region.
   Using a suite of paleoproxy reconstructions and information from previous studies examining the relationship between climate variability and natural processes, the authors explore how such persistent moisture anomalies affect the delivery of vital goods and services provided by Glacier NP and surrounding areas. These analyses show that regional water resources and tourism are particularly vulnerable to persistent moisture anomalies in the Glacier NP area. Many of these same decadal-scale wet and dry events were also seen among a wider network of hydroclimatic reconstructions along a north - south transect of the Rocky Mountains. Such natural climate variability can, in turn, have enormous impacts on the sustainable provision of natural resources over wide areas. Overall, these results highlight the susceptibility of goods and services provided by protected areas like Glacier NP to natural climate variability, and show that this susceptibility will likely be compounded by the effects of future human-induced climate change.

AB Planted pastures ( mainly Brachiaria spp) are the most extensive land use in the cerrado (savannas of central Brazil) with an area of approximately 50 x 10(6) ha. The objective of the study was to assess the effects of pasture restoration on the N dynamics ( net N mineralization/ nitrification, available inorganic N and soil N oxide gas fluxes - NO and N2O), C dynamics (CO2 fluxes and microbial biomass carbon), and diversity of the soil bacterial community using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) profiles. Sampling was done monthly on a farm in Planaltina, Goias, Brazil (15 degrees 13'S, 47 degrees 42 'W) from November 2001 to April 2002. Three areas of cerradao ( dense cerrado) were converted to pasture ( Brachiaria brizantha) in 1991, and after 8 years degradation was evident with the decreasing plant biomass production. Methods to restore these pastures were investigated for their sustainability, principally their effects on trace gas emissions. The pastures have been managed since 1999 as follows: 1) fertilized plot (N = 60 kg ha(-1) yr(-1), P = 12 kg ha(-1) yr(-1)); 2) grass - legume plot, Brachiaria associated with a legume ( Stylosanthes guianensis) with addition of P (12 kg ha(-1) yr(-1)); and 3) a traditional plot without management. A fourth area of cerradao was converted to pasture in 1999 and was not managed ( young pasture). Ammonium was the predominant inorganic N form in the soils (similar to 76 mg N kg(-1)) for all treatments throughout the study. In December 2001 a reduction in average soil N-NH4+ was observed (similar to 30 mg N kg(-1)) compared to November 2001, probably related to plant demand. All plots had high variability of soil N gases emissions, but during the wet season, the NO and N2O soil fluxes were near zero. The results of the water addition experiment made during the dry season ( September 2002) indicated that the transition of dry to wet season is an important period for the production of N gases in the fertilized pasture and in the young pasture. Soil CO2 fluxes also increased after the water addition and the grass - legume plot had the highest increase in soil respiration ( from similar to 2 to 8.3 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)). The lowest values of soil respiration and microbial biomass carbon (similar to 320 mg C kg(-1) soil) tended to be observed in the young pasture, because the superficial layer of the soil ( 0 - 10 cm) was removed during the conversion to pasture. Trace gas emissions measured after the water addition experiment corresponded to rapid changes in the soil bacterial community. The young pasture sample showed the lowest level of similarity in relation to the others, indicating that the bacterial community is also influenced by the time since conversion. This study indicates that the restoration technique of including Stylosanthes guianensis with B. brizantha increases plant productivity without the peaks of N oxide gas emissions that are often associated with the use of N fertilizers. Additionally, the soil bacterial community structure may be restored to one similar to that of native cerrado grasslands, suggesting that this restoration method may beneficially affect bacterially mediated processes.

AB We present and discuss a method that allows the disaggregation of national Ecological Footprints by economic sector, detailed final demand category, sub-national area or socio-economic group. This is done by combining existing National Footprint Accounts with input-output analysis. Calculations in the empirical part are carried out by using supply and use tables for the United Kingdom, covering the reporting period 2000. Ecological Footprints are allocated to detailed household consumption activities following the COICOP classification system and to a detailed breakdown of capital investment. The method presented enables the calculation of comparable Ecological Footprints on all sub-national levels and for different socio-economic groups. The novelty of the approach lies in the use of input-output analysis to re-allocate existing Footprint accounts, in the detail of disaggregation by consumption category and in the expanded use of household expenditure data. This extends the potential for applications of the Ecological Footprint concept and helps to inform scenarios, policies and strategies on sustainable consumption. The method described in this paper can be applied to every country for which a National Footprint Account exists and where appropriate economic and environmental accounts are available. The approach helps to save time in data collection and improves the consistency between Ecological Footprint estimates for a particular human society from different researchers. For these reasons, the suggested methodology includes crucial steps on the way towards a standardisation of Ecological Footprint accounts. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Ecosystem-based management requires integration of multiple system components and uses, identifying and striving for sustainable outcomes, precaution in avoiding deleterious actions, and adaptation based on experience to achieve effective solutions. Efforts underway or in planning to restore and manage two major coastal ecosystems, the Chesapeake Bay (Chesapeake Bay Program) and coastal Louisiana (Louisiana Coastal Area Plan and Gulf Hypoxia Action Plan), are examined with respect to these four principles. These multifaceted restoration programs represent among the foremost challenges for science and coastal management in the United States and, thereby, have important implications for addressing the coastal environmental crises being experienced throughout the world. Although frameworks exist for integration of management objectives in both regions, the technical ability for the quantitatively integrated assessment of multiple stressors and strategies is still in an early stage of development. Science is also being challenged to identify sustainable futures, but emerging concepts of ecosystem resilience offer some promising approaches. Precautionary management is best conceived with regard to fisheries, but should become a more explicit consideration for managing risks and avoiding unanticipated consequences of restoration activities. Adaptive management is embraced as a central process in coastal Louisiana ecosystem restoration, but has not formally been implemented in the more mature Chesapeake Bay restoration. Based on these experiences, ecosystem-based management could be advanced by: (1) orienting more scientific activity to providing the solutions needed for ecosystem restoration; (2) building bridges crossing scientific and management barriers to more effectively integrate science and management; (3) directing more attention to understanding and predicting achievable restoration outcomes that consider possible state changes and ecosystem resilience; (4) improving the capacity of science to characterize and effectively communicate uncertainty; and (5) fully integrating modeling, observations, and research to facilitate more adaptive management.

AB Richness in species should be appropriately measured in samples of a standard size. Standard plot sizes of 400 m(2) were recommended in order to compare the alpha-diversity between different ecosystem types.
   For the application of diversity aspects in landscape management, further attributes of the species composition should be considered. The state of the regional and phytocoenological species pool and the relationship between autochthonous and allochthonous species may help to describe the importance and potential risks of biological invasions. Life strategy types reflect the interactions between species trade-offs and environmental constraints. The species preferences for different hemerobic steps may be used as indicators of human impacts especially in agricultural and urban landscapes and ecological indication values for different site qualities. These attributes in combination may help to characterize ecosystem properties and to develop scenarios for succession processes.
   Biodiversity in its different aspects can only be successfully sustained, if the multitude of biological interactions with the human way of life in and subsiding on ecosystems are considered. The approach of the convention of biodiversity (CBD) based on the 'Malawi Principles' focus on the functional relationships and processes within ecosystems and propagates the use of adaptive management practices at scales appropriate for the issues being addressed. The principles take into account the need for integrative cooperation. A regional application of these principles is necessary for sustainable landscape planning. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The analysis of socio-ecological systems requires new, qualitatively different evaluation schemes that enable an integrated assessment of ecological, social, and economic factors through the use of appropriate indicators. This paper addresses the risk assessment of negative impacts from tourism pressure for 10 socio-ecological systems in the Salento region of southern Italy. Two models are combined to perform the assessment. The first is Holling's conceptual sustainability model, which is proposed as an alternative to Butler's Life Cycle model. The second is a fragility model, where fragility is modelled as resource value combined with stress (pressure). Pressure is the number of tourists in each sub-region, and resource value is the proportion of protected area that draws tourists to a sub-region. In this way, the fragility model has a combination of socio- and ecological terms. A new approach is developed to improve the estimates of pressure and fragility, and to provide relevant operational indicators. The number of official (counted) tourist visits generally underestimates the true number of visits, but the discrepancy varies among sub-regions. In order to estimate underhand (uncounted) tourist visits, a separate procedure relating "number of people" to "solid urban waste production" is developed, and then it is used to correct the official estimates. The results suggest that relative risk of sub-regions from tourism pressure may not be adequately represented by official counted visits. The set of developed indicators allow identifying two specific sub-regions as the highest risk areas, and these are discussed in terms of Holling's sustainability model. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The condition of Australia's water catchments was assessed in a 2 million km(2) intensive land-use zone (ILZ) as part of a National Land and Water Resources Audit (the Audit). The assessment used existing biophysical data obtained from satellite imagery, digital elevation models, computed or derived values, surrogates and existing spatial data from state and national databases. The data were used to derive indicators and an index of relative catchment condition for 3718 sub-catchments and 197 basins. The spatial patterns for catchment condition were then mapped across the ILZ. The term indicator is used consistently to mean a single attribute (even if it is derived from several variables), whereas a sub-index or an index is an aggregation of scaled indicator values.
   An inventory was made of all potentially relevant biophysical measures of the water, land and biota in catchments that existed in archives. Criteria to assess data quality including a national coverage, ease of interpretation, scale, relevance to policy development and catchment management were applied to some 110 measures from which 21 indicators were ultimately selected and used for tabulation, mapping and interpretation. The data were assembled at 250 m cell resolution and aggregated to 5 km cells as the base unit for analysis. To map the indicators or indices, a five-point classification (quintiles) was used, ranging from relatively poorer to better condition. The class boundaries were based on equal intervals or equal areas under the frequency curve of each indicator or index. Indicator values for each 5 km cell ranged from 1 to 5 (1 being poorer, 5 being better). Index values were calculated by adding the scores for a set of indicators, for example, all the 21 identified and taking a mean for all the 5 km cells within each catchment.
   Data manipulations and analysis used a multi-component decision support system (DSS), geographic information system (GIS) called catchment condition (CatCon). Numerous maps were generated for each indicator and for indices comprising different combinations of indicators, ranging from the complete set (21), a core set (14) to relatively few (6) and for different regionalisations. Cross-comparisons between catchment condition classes and some consumptive outputs from catchments were also carried out. Only maps for the index based on 14 indicators and a single cross-comparison are presented here as illustrations. The web site www.affa.gov.au/catcon/ has more examples.
   The main points to emerge were: clear interpretable patterns of better to poorer condition were defined for the intensive land-use zone; visualisations of catchment condition were markedly different for classes defined by equal area or equal interval; the broad patterns of relative condition could be captured with relatively few aggregated indicators; the cross-comparisons suggested areas where land-use changes are needed to develop sustainable land-use systems. The study illustrates that relatively low quality but extensive data can be used to provide a rational basis to identify priority areas for management action and for natural resource management policy development. We suggest that the development of a higher quality national data set in Australia to assess the condition of the Nation's catchments may be best achieved through the co-ordination and collection of core data sets (indicators) at regional scales.

ID SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB Indicators to assess sustainable land development often focus on either economic or ecologic aspects of landscape use. The concept of multifunctional land use helps merging those two focuses by emphasising on the rule that economic action is per se accompanied by ecological utility: commodity outputs (CO, e.g., yields) are paid for on the market, but non-commodity outputs (NCO, e.g., landscape aesthetics) so far are public goods with no markets.
   Agricultural production schemes often provided both outputs by joint production, but with technical progress under prevailing economic pressure, joint production increasingly vanishes by decoupling of commodity from non-commodity production.
   Simultaneously, by public and political awareness of these shortcomings, there appears a societal need or even demand for some non-commodity outputs of land use, which induces a market potential, and thus, shift towards the status of a commodity outputs.
   An approach is presented to merge both types of output by defining an indicator of social utility (SUMLU): production schemes are considered with respect to social utility of both commodity and non-commodity outputs. Social utility in this sense includes environmental and economic services as long as society expresses a demand for them. For each combination of parameters at specific frame conditions (e.g., soil and climate properties of a landscape) a production possibility curve can reflect trade-offs between commodity and non-commodity outputs. On each production possibility curve a welfare optimum can be identified expressing the highest achievable value of social utility as a trade-off between CO and NCO production.
   When applying more parameters, a cluster of welfare optimums is generated. Those clusters can be used for assessing production schemes with respect to sustainable land development.
   Examples of production possibility functions are given on easy applicable parameters (nitrogen leaching versus gross margin) and on more complex ones (biotic integrity).
   Social utility, thus allows to evaluate sustainability of land development in a cross-sectoral approach with respect to multifunctionality. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Ecosystems and the species and communities within them are highly complex systems that defy predictions with any degree of certainty. Managing and conserving these systems in the face of uncertainty remains a daunting challenge, particularly with respect to developing networks of marine reserves. Here we review several modelling frameworks that explicitly acknowledge and incorporate uncertainty, and then use these methods to evaluate reserve spacing rules given increasing levels of uncertainty about larval dispersal distances. Our approach finds similar spacing rules as have been proposed elsewhere - roughly 20-200 km - but highlights several advantages provided by uncertainty modelling over more traditional approaches to developing these estimates. In particular, we argue that uncertainty modelling can allow for (1) an evaluation of the risk associated with any decision based on the assumed uncertainty; (2) a method for quantifying the costs and benefits of reducing uncertainty; and (3) a useful tool for communicating to stakeholders the challenges in managing highly uncertain systems. We also argue that incorporating rather than avoiding uncertainty will increase the chances of successfully achieving conservation and management goals.

AB The last decade of innovation in forest management in Canada is reviewed. Institutions such as the Sustainable Forest Management Network and Canada's Model Forest Program have attempted to develop a better understanding of ecological disturbance patterns and processes. Additional research has explored socio-economic dimensions of sustainable forestry, such as ways to incorporate the aspirations of indigenous peoples, build community capacity, and facilitate forest certification. The most promising innovations tend to have both environmental benefits (sustaining non-timber values) and economic benefits (reducing costs and sustaining future timber values), making their implementation more likely. Some on-the-ground examples of "win-win" solutions at stand and landscape levels in Canada's boreal forests include: patch retention in conjunction with the creation of large cutblocks; protection of advance regeneration during timber harvesting; promotion and prediction of natural regeneration; various approaches to mixedwood (broadleaf and conifer) management; avoidance of unnecessary brush control; extended rotations and selection management for some tree species and stand types; promoting the flow of fibre to its highest value uses; and zoning in support of intensive silviculture, thereby potentially reducing harvesting pressures from lands with high conservation value. More closely emulating natural patterns of forest disturbance and forest recovery can help sustain biodiversity and ecosystem services, but may not generate all values desired from managed forests. Further research is needed to calibrate indicators of ecological sustainability. Institutional and policy innovation must also be evaluated in the context of adaptive management to improve the effectiveness of forestry practices and nurture the social license for the utilization and management of public forests.

AB A common management aim is to keep large herbivore densities at sustainable levels. However, measuring grazing pressure is difficult. We seek combinations of herb species and morphological traits that serve as indicators of grazing pressure in alpine areas of Scandinavia. In a fully replicated, landscape-scale experiment with three replicates of each of three levels of sheep density (zero, low, and high), we measured grazing frequency (numbers of plants eaten, as a proportion), flowering frequency, and plant height for 17 common herb species for two consecutive grazing seasons. For eight species, grazing frequency varied significantly between treatments, and for four of these species there was additional strong between-year variation. The estimate for total grazing frequency of herbs decreased when more species of decreasing preference were included, and it was significantly lower in the second grazing season. There were large between-year differences in plant height probably related to weather patterns. A grazing treatment effect on plant height was found only for two species. Flowering frequency in selected species changed even at low sheep densities and was thus not considered suitable except for indicating ungrazed areas. Grazing frequency of three herbs, Saussurea virgaurea, Rumex acetosa, and Pyrola minor, provided a useful indicator of total grazing pressure, as these species were grazed only at high sheep density. Our study area is likely to be representative of alpine areas in southern Norway, but we advise careful calibration using monitoring procedures before similar management decisions on stocking rates can be fully implemented in other ecosystems.

AB This paper presents findings from the pattern of participation and discourse analysis of the online interaction among in-service teachers in the teacher training institute in Singapore. It was found that the teachers formed a knowledge-building community and jointly discussed issues related to integrating information technology into the classroom. There was evidence that teachers formed a socially cohesive community and their participations were active. However it was found that in-depth and sustainable online interaction were lacking. The authors suggest searching for ways to promote deep and sustainable online interaction, especially in terms of getting participants to detect the gap in ideas and challenging assumptions.

AB In 2005, the economic policy of Slovakia was one of the determinants in contributing to strong economic growth and relatively high level of macroeonomic equlibria. The policy mix (consolidation of public finances together with monetary policy oriented towards desinflation) created a forseable macroeconomic framework. The formation of the most relevant segments of macroeconomic policy led not only to quantitative improvement in macroeconomic equlibria of the economy (public finance deficit, inflation rate) but also led to improvement of the policy decision-making quality. The ongoing reform of public finance governance (in the field of fiscal policy) and inflation targeting (in the field of monetary policy) led to improvement in credibility of these economic policy segments. The aim of this article is to evaluate measures which where specific in the year 2005 and contribution of these policies to the sustainable development of the Slovak economy.

AB Shrift towards private ownership in forestry recourses in transition countries of Central and Eastern Europe promotes forest values and their development in diversified ways. In this paper, we provide a general equilibrium model assisting in estimation of forest management practices in the regional level by comparing different ownership structures and public policy measures.
   The model is applied for the county of Banska Bystrica in Slovakia. The results provide an integrated tool identifying possibilities to address strategic development at the regional level that relates to the improvement of local wellbeing and sustainability applicable in other regions with diversified forest ownership structure.

AB Fe2O3 photocatalyzes the oxidation of aniline to azobenzene and exhibits sustainable catalytic activity. The reaction in ethanol was studied with natural sunlight and UV irradiation (365 nm) as a function of [aniline], catalyst loading, airflow rate, solvent composition, etc. The product formation is larger with illumination at 254 nm than at 365 nm. Electron donors enhance the photocatalysis and singlet oxygen quencher fails to inhibit the catalysis. The photocatalysis occurs in protic and aprotic solvents. The mechanism of photocatalysis is discussed and the product formation analyzed using a kinetic model. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID PAYMENTS CRISES; BALANCE
AB In February 2001, Turkey became the latest emerging market to experience a devastating crisis, following the collapse of its soft exchange rate peg. The crisis severely damaged the country's banking system and led to an unprecedented contraction in economic activity. The boom that preceded it seemed to be relatively short lived, as the initial rush of capital outflow occurred just eleven months after the start of the program, and the fatal exit just three months later This paper discusses the factors that seemed to play an important role in the collapse of Turkey's International Monetary Fund (IMF)-supported exchange rate-based stabilization plait just thirteen months after its commencement. It is often difficult to attribute such crises entirely to a single factor, and not always possible to arrive at a strong verdict by analyzing economic developments in light of, or ill the manner formally suggested by, the alternative models commonly used to analyze currency crises in the literature. In the Turkish case, enumerating the many factors that may have contributed to the collapse is important and very useful-yet this should not obscure the critical role played by the failure to establish or achieve tangible progress toward a sustainable fiscal regime. Not recognizing this fundamental weakness could easily lead observers to emphasize design flaws as the main culprit or to argue that the collapse could have been avoided if several other factors had broken more in Turkey's favor.

AB It is argued that the sustainability of external debts depends on the stationarity of the current account balance. This study tests for the stationarity of current account deficits for a sample of sixteen Latin American countries, employing a new test, advocated by Breuer et al. (2002), that allows one to test for unit roots in heterogeneous panel data sets. This version of the augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test involves estimating ADF regressions within a seemingly unrelated regression (SURADF) framework. The benefits of treating a panel to overcome low test power are well known, but this particular test also offers key advantages over existing alternative panel data unit root tests. Unlike previous tests, this one identifies which members from within the panel are responsible for rejecting the null hypothesis of joint nonstationarity. In addition, the SURADF test does not presume disturbances that are independently and identically distributed. Using annual data covering the period 1979-2001, this study finds strong evidence in favor of current account mean-reversion for at least twelve Latin American countries.

AB Public interest is central to future energy. A transition from fossil to renewable fuels would be likely to involve post-normal science, which is science constrained by uncertainty, urgency, high stakes, and public values. Future energy transformation will involve post-normal science because public interest will be central, and political will may be as limiting as engineering issues. This paper discusses cases of energy transformation in human and insect societies, showing general patterns in resource transitions, and in human responses to them. Understanding these general patterns allows scenarios to be developed describing some consequences of possible energy futures. The costs and benefits of these alternatives will have tangible differences for the interests of people whose lives are affected. Values, uncertainty, urgency, and high stakes all suggest the utility of a post-normal approach to future energy. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Science for sustainability policy requires the handling of multi-dimensional and multi-scale analyses. Integrated assessment is about generating information relevant for decision-making. This generates a divide between two scientific paradigms: (1) 'Post-Normal Science' acknowledges the unavoidable existence of non-equivalent perceptions and representations of the reality; legitimate but contrasting perspectives found among social actors; heavy levels of uncertainty. (2) 'Normal Science', believes that it is possible to handle in a rigorous and rational way these challenges and that therefore it is possible to define in substantive terms 'the best course of action' for society. This paper is written to explain the reasons and the tools developed by scientists working within the Post-Normal Science paradigm. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper discusses sustainability problems related to socioeconomic energy flows based upon the societal metabolism approach. Contrary to conventional energy statistics that only include energy used in technical devices, this approach considers all kinds of energy flows related to human societies, including nutritional energy flows of humans and domesticated animals. Based upon human population data and data on the pro capite energy metabolism of hunter-gatherers and agricultural societies as well as on statistical data on industrial energy flows a time series of the global socioeconomic energetic metabolism for the last 106 years and a scenario for the next 50 years is derived. These estimates show that the total energy input of mankind has risen by several orders of magnitude since the Neolithic revolution about 10,000 years ago. Whereas the energy input of agricultural societies prior to the advent of industrial societies about 200-300 years ago did not exceed 5% of global terrestrial net primary productivity (NPP), humanity's energy input currently amounts to about 30% of global terrestrial NPP and is likely to surpass 50% in about 2050. This shows that the sheer magnitude of human-induced flows is historically unprecedented and poses at least two closely interrelated sustainability challenges: (1) a reduction of energy available to ecosystem processes that can be assessed using the concept of 'human appropriation of net primary productivity' and (2) the changes in the global carbon cycle resulting from land-use change and fossil-energy combustion.

AB A case study with respect to the current trends in hydrogen technology and market developments is presented in this paper. The main goal is to design an autonomous, environmentally sustainable and zero emission power system using commercially available equipment. In order to achieve the optimum cost effective solution, its limitations are defined by simulating its performance over a year. A scenario is chosen which is representative of an area with significant wind potential, where the grid connection is relatively long or the construction of the line itself would irretrievably harm the environment. This study simulated the operation of a small, remote hotel primarily powered by a wind turbine and supported by a hydrogen energy system incorporating a medium pressure electrolyzer, a compressed hydrogen gas storage unit and a PEM fuel cell stack. The simulated load is biased towards a particular season as in the case of a small hotel for summer holidays. This arrangement takes advantage of the long period of low load during the "off peak" season, which enables the production of reserves of hydrogen to supplement the wind generated electricity during the "peak" season, avoiding the use of a large electrolyzer system, which is the most expensive and vulnerable component. The simulation results showed that for this particular system, a wind turbine rated at four times the peak load power associated with the optimum combination of an electrolyzer and a hydrogen storage unit would meet the electrical energy needs of a 10 bedroom, non-luxury hotel under the supervision of a load management controller.

AB This paper investigates the relationship between the energy intensity in 12 transition Countries of Eastern Europe and that in the EU 15 countries. The raw data show some evidence of convergence, and a carefully estimated econometric model of lagged adjustment confirms this. The forecast Values for energy intensities of transition countries between 2000 and 2020 show significant convergence with the EU levels. On the other hand, actual energy demand levels over the same period show an increasing demand in the countries despite the reductions in energy intensity. Therefore, it will not be feasible to use as a sustainability target a non-increasing level of total energy consumption . (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The aim of this article is to investigate Turkey's main energy sources and importance of its usage in the energy sector. Turkey is rapidly growing in terms of both its economy and population due to its demand for energy. Domestic coal, geothermal, and hydropower reserves of Turkey are approximately 1% of the world's total. In this respect, Turkey's domestic energy production has not exceeded 40% of its energy demand. For this reason, Turkey is a net energy importer and also the energy demand of Turkey is expected to be doubled between the years 2000 and 2010 and be fourfold between the years 2000 and 2025. Turkish energy policy is mainly concentrated on assurance of energy supply in a reliable manner and sufficiently in time, under economic and clean terms and in a way to support and orientate the target growth and social developments.

   technology assessment
AB In this paper we will pose the question whether a higher level of user participation could be used as a strategy to improve the development and dissemination of sustainable energy technologies. We will especially focus on user-led innovation processes with a high involvement of individual end-users.
   In our argument we will draw on several case studies in the field of renewable energy technologies-in particular solar collectors and biomass heating systems-and sustainable building technologies. Users in these case studies were involved in the design or planning processes, sometimes in a very selective way and with limited influence, sometimes very active and for quite a long period of time. Especially in the case of renewable energy technologies self-building groups were highly successful and resulted in improved and widely disseminated technologies.
   Based on the empirical results of our case studies we will critically discuss the potential of user involvement (especially in self-building groups) for the development and promotion of sustainable energy technologies and outline technological and social preconditions for the success of such approaches.

TI CEPHEUS results: measurements and occupants' satisfaction provide
   evidence for Passive Houses being an option for sustainable building
SO ENERGY POLICY

DT Article
DE "Passive House"; energy efficiency in buildings; user satisfaction
AB Passive houses offer extended living comfort with only 15-20% of the space heating demand of conventional new buildings while the extra costs of this standard are only about 10% of the total building costs. In the first part of this paper, detailed measurements for 11 "Passive House" projects with more than 100 dwelling units from the EU-funded demonstration project CEPHEUS (Cost Efficient Passive Houses as European Standards) are presented.
   All projects exhibit extraordinarily low space heat consumptions. Compared with ordinary, newly erected buildings, 80% of the space heat consumption could be saved. The total primary energy consumption (including household electricity) was less than 50% of that of conventional new buildings. The measurements show that the buildings also offer comfortable indoor conditions in both summer and winter.
   Several social research studies revealed that the users are well pleased with their homes. The second part of the paper focuses on low-income tenant's satisfaction in the world's first multi-story Passive Houses in Kassel, Germany. This building contrasts sharply with the "standard" Passive House, occupied by its owners. A 2.5 year study was conducted from spring of 2000 to autumn of 2002. The development of opinions, attitudes, behaviour, and satisfaction over time could be recorded. The building is a clear success, the tenant's satisfaction is high.
   It is concluded that this building type fulfils the conditions of sustainability in social, ecological and economic respects and should therefore be disseminated on a larger scale. To this end, the last part of the paper describes the development of the Passive House standard in Germany, Austria and Switzerland, from the first demonstration project in 1991 to about 3500 dwelling units today. The prerequisites for this development are analysed. Finally, the authors give their view about the political possibilities for pushing Passive Houses into the market as well as for stimulating a market pull for this comfortable and energy efficient building type.

AB Wind energy is the fastest-growing electricity-generating technology. The wind energy targets set during the last decade have all been surpassed. New targets are proposed for 2010 and 2020, since the existing European Commission and European Wind Energy Association targets do not reflect the trends in the market. Climate change is a major challenge to sustainable development worldwide and is increasingly recognized by forward-looking political and business leaders. One of the tasks we are facing is a profound transformation of our energy system over the next few decades of replacing fossil fuels with renewable energies and dramatically increasing energy efficiency. This article reviews the progress made by wind energy in the last ten years, and discusses the potential of this technology in the European Union and Turkey for the future. The European experience has shown that wind energy today comprises a reliable and cost-effective technology with positive effects on the reduction of CO2 emissions. This study also shows that Turkey has more wind energy potential and existing wind-electricity-producing companies should be encouraged and supported by the government while new financing mechanisms are needed to promote investment in wind energy.

AB Renewable energy is proving to be commercially viable for a growing list of consumers and uses. Renewable energy technologies provide many benefits that go well beyond energy alone. More and more, renewable energies are contributing to the three pillars of sustainable development not only in IEA countries, but globally. Turkey is an energy-importing country; more than half of the energy requirement has been supplied by imports. Domestic oil and lignite reserves are limited and lignites are characterized by high ash, sulfur, and moisture content. In this regard, renewable energy resources appear to be one of the most efficient and effective solutions for sustainable energy development in Turkey. Turkey's geographical location has several advantages for the extensive use of most of these renewable energy sources. Because of this and the fact that it has limited fossil fuel resources, a gradual shift from fossil fuels to renewables seems to be serious and the sole alternative for Turkey. This article presents the role of the renewables in future directions in IEA countries with Turkey. At present the share of hydropower and biomass is high as 30% in the primary energy production of Turkey. In the case of solar, geothermal, and wind energy, there is an important potential for domestic heating and electricity generation.

AB On the occasion of the 25th anniversary of the Brazilian ESP Project, this paper discusses why it has been able to sustain itself and develop over such a long period. The analysis focuses on two main areas of decision-making which led to this success: the structure of the project itself and the ESP methodology which was developed. Comparing the Brazilian experience with that of other projects, the paper identifies a number of decisions which determined the process-based nature of the project structure. These were crucial in ensuring a flexible and responsive administrative structure and enabled participants to feel 'ownership' of the project. With regard to the ESP methodology developed, the paper highlights the way that a 'Brazilian' or 'Latin' approach to the teaching of ESP was developed. In both areas the importance of using a local knowledge approach to decision-making is emphasised. (c) 2005 The American University. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The Amazon timber industry can be roughly divided into three periods; the early production period of the 1950s to the 1970s, followed by a boom which lasted from the mid 1970s to the late 1980s, and a period of industry consolidation and migration to new frontiers in the early 1990s which is now coming to an end. The building of the Trans-Amazon highway in the 1970s, which stretches more than 3,000 km through the Amazon forest, opened the forest up to smallholder settlers, foresters, and wealthy land speculators, and though the highway is largely unpaved and virtually impassable for four months of the year during the rainy season, migration to the region is relentless. Smallholder settlers have deforestation licenses that allow the clearing of 3 hectares per year and the sale of 60 cubic meters per year, yet because no formal forest management plans have been developed for these smallholder systems, nearly 80 percent of log sales from smallholders are currently illegal by government rules. The development of forest management projects on smallholder settlement lots will help move the region toward equitable forest-based economic development and a peaceful resolution to the problems now facing migrant families. Without change, however, further illegal degradation of the forest should be expected, and the current timber industry is in such disarray from political mismanagement that in October 2005 the federal police temporarily suspended the transport of all logs from the Amazon.

AB In Japan, a majority of urban waste is incinerated to reduce the volume and the residue (incineration ash) is land filled. Japanese municipalities, however, are confronted with serious shortages of waste landfill sites. To mitigate this situation, Taiheiyo Cement Corporation has developed two technologies, which are Ash Rinsing Process and Ecocement. Incineration ash is a suitable material for cement production because it primarily contains essential chemical components of cement clinker. The problem is that chlorine and heavy metals accompanying primary components cause operational trouble and deteriorate quality and material safety of cement. Ash rinsing technology will be effective to remove chlorine and heavy metals in the ash. Therefore, for municipalities closely located existing Ordinary Portland cement plants, it is the simplest way to use waste incineration ash as a raw material in those cement plants. Ecocemet, on the other hand, will be an attractive option for the municipalities distant from cement plants. Ecocement is defined as cement that is produced from over 500 kg (dry base) waste incineration ash supplemented with other wastes (sludge, etc) per ton of Ecocement. According to the discharged amount of ash, correspondingly scaled Ecocement plant is needed. In Ecocement production process, chlorine in the ash is combined with intentionally added alkalis or heavy metals and is extracted. Extracted metal chlorides are recycled as metal sources. Two types of Ecocement can be used in the fields of ready mixed concrete, concrete blocks or soil stabilizer. The first commercial plant of Ecocement constructed in Chiba prefecture started operation in April 2001. In July 2002, Japanese Industrial Standard of Ecocement was published. Consequently, Ecocement has become an authorized product in Japan. The second Ecocement plant is now under construction in Tokyo.

AB In this article, the author proposed a new concept of the whole vital process of concrete and its compatibility with environment. Different actors which have influence on relations between the whole vital process of concrete and environment were studied and discussed. Several feasibility measures to. improve relations between the whole vital process of concrete and environment were put forward; also for the first time, the authors use AHP and fuzzy mathematics to offer a compatibility evaluation model of the vital process of concrete with environment. At last, an example was given, which illustrated an evaluation process based on fuzzy-AHP in detail. The model will be a useful tool for the researchers or decision makers to evaluate the relationship between concrete and environment, which may be helpful to sustainable development of concrete material and technology.

AB The magnesium phosphosilicate cement (MPSC) is a novel inorganic binder, it sets quickly and has very high strength. Also, it is a promising material for the sustainable development. In the present study, the durability of MPSC were investigated, including deicer scaling resistance under freezing-thawing cycles, chemical corrosion resistance in sodium sulfate and magnesium sulfate solutions, and wet-dry resistance in fresh and natural sea water. For comparison, Portland cement samples were also prepared for parallel tests. Test results showed that the chemical durability of MPSC is superior that of Portland cement. The causes of the high performance may be attributed to the low water demand and a reasonable microstructure of hardened paste matrix.

AB The subject of concrete recycling is regarded as very important in the general attempt for sustainable development in our times. Due to a wide range of variability of engineering properties for recycled concrete, a large number of experiments are usually required to decide a suitable mixture. Within the scope of this study, 13 different concrete mixtures were manufactured. The amount of recycled concrete aggregate (RCA) were 0%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, and 100%, respectively. The replacement levels of ultra-fine fly ash are 0%, 15%, 25%, 35% and 50%, respectively. The physical and mechanical properties along with their workability of concrete produced with RCA and ultra-fine fly ash were investigated. The experiment results showed that ultra-fine fly ash replacement had an important effect on performance of concrete with different amount of RCA.

AB Water leach tests (WLTs) and total elemental analyses were performed on 12 green sands, zero-valent iron (ZVI) and two aquifer materials to determine their leaching characteristics for reuse applications in Wisconsin (USA). Results of the WLTs and TEAs show that none of the materials, including the ZVI and the aquifer materials, meet criteria in Wisconsin for placing industrial byproducts below the groundwater table (GWT). Concentrations of As, Cd, Mn, Pb, Sb, and F from WLTs on the green sands exceeded Wisconsin's maximum permissible concentrations (MPCs). However, the concentrations exceeded the MPCs by a small amount and similar concentrations were obtained from the ZVI, a material that is commonly placed below the GWT for groundwater remediation. Al concentrations exceeded the MPC for three green sands, and Fe concentrations exceeded the MPC for 10 of the green sands and the ZVI. TEAs showed concentrations exceeding MPCs for As and Be for all materials (including the ZVI and aquifer materials) except one green sand, Cr concentrations appreciably above the MPC for two of the green sands and ZVI, and concentrations slightly above the MPC for two polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons for several green sands. Column tests showed that Cr, Pb, and Fe leach from green sands under flow-through conditions at concentrations comparable to ZVI. Overall review of the data indicates that using green sand as a reactive barrier medium should pose no greater risk than ZVI, provided the green sand does not leach Al at elevated levels and is not contaminated with other byproducts that may contain organic contaminants.

AB The area in Guntur district, Andhra Pradesh, India, is selected to discuss the impact of seasonal variation of groundwater quality on irrigation and human health, where the agriculture is the main livelihood of rural people and the groundwater is the main source for irrigation and drinking. Granite gneisses associated with schists and charnockites of the Precambrian Eastern Ghats underlie the area. Groundwater samples collected seasonally, pre- and post-monsoons, during three years from forty wells in the area were analyzed for pH, EC, TDS, TA, TH, Ca2+ , Mg2+, Na+, K, CO32-, HCO3-, Cl-, SO42-, NO3- and F-. The chemical relationships in Piper's diagram, Chebotarev's genetic classification and Gibbs's diagram suggest that the groundwaters mainly belong to non-carbonate alkali type and Cl- group, and are controlled by evaporation-dominance, respectively, due to the influence of semi-arid climate, gentle slope, sluggish drainage conditions, greater water-rock interaction, and anthropogenic activities. A comparison of the groundwater quality in relation to drinking water quality standards proves that most of the water samples are not suitable for drinking, especially in post-monsoon period. US Salinity Laboratory's and Wilcox's diagrams, and %Na+ used for evaluating the water quality for irrigation suggest that the majority of the groundwater samples are not good for irrigation in post-monsoon compared to that in pre-monsoon. These conditions are caused due to leaching of salts from the overlying materials by infiltrating recharge waters. A management plan is suggested for sustainable development of the area.

   solids; China
AB The Ordos Basin of China encompasses Shaanxi, Gansu, and Shanxi provinces, Ningxia and Inner Mongolia autonomous regions. It lacks significant surface water resources. Among the water-bearing formations, the Luohe formation, with an area of 1.32 x 10(5) km(2), is the most prospective aquifer. Groundwater quality data collected at 211 boreholes drilled into the Luhe formation indicate a complex distribution of groundwater chemistry. The hydrochemical properties were used to study the recharge, runoff, and discharge conditions of the groundwater in Ordos Basin and to evaluate sustainable groundwater resources. In the northern part of the basin, the hydrochemistry types and the total dissolved solids (TDS) show a clear lateral transition from SEE to NWW, indicating that the groundwater gets recharge in the northwest region and discharges in the southeast region. In the southern part of the basin, maximum TDS occurs at the center of the Malian River valley, from which the TDS decreases radially. Therefore, the groundwater in the southern basin gets recharge from the southeast and southwest regions, and the Malian River valley is the discharge zone. As a result of this research, the areas with portable groundwater were delineated. They include most of the southeast region of the Sishili Ridge, east of the Ziwu Mountain, and the southwest corner of the basin. The TDS of the groundwater in these regions is less than 1 g/l, and the hydrochemistry type is either HCO3 or HCO3 center dot SO4.

AB There is growing support for the use of integrated assessments (IAs)/sustainability impact assessments (SlAs), at different government levels and geographic scales of policy-making and planning, both nationally and internationally. However, delivering good quality IAs/SlAs, in the near future, could be challenging. This paper mainly focuses upon one area of concern, differences between research and other technical contributions intended to strengthen assessment methodologies and the types of assessment methods considered usable by practitioners. To help in addressing this concern, the development of a common assessment framework is proposed, which is based on a shared, practitioner-researcher-stakeholder understanding of what constitutes a satisfactory integrated/sustainability impact assessment. The paper outlines a possible structure for this framework, which contains three interconnected elements-the planning context in which the assessment is to be carried out; the process by which the assessment is to be undertaken and its findings used; and the methods, technical and consultative, by which impacts are to be assessed. It concludes with suggested 'next steps', addressed to researchers, practitioners and other stakeholders, by which the assessment framework might be tested and improved, and its subsequent use supported.

AB This article stresses the importance of within-government capacity build as the optimal approach to minimizing landslide risk to the most vulnerable communities in the developing world. Landslide risk is an integrated issue that demands strong managerial leadership and multidisciplinary inclusion to develop structures that deliver sustainable improvements in the reduction of risk. The tension between projects demanding international technical and financial intervention and those capable of "within-country" solutions are examined. More particularly, the challenges of developing a management methodology capable of energizing inter-ministry collaboration to achieve community-level action is examined in the context of a recently established program of slope stability management in St. Lucia. The program, Management of Slope Stability in Communities (MoSSaiC), is shown to have successfully fostered not only extensive technical collaboration within government but also to have energized local communities in the shared mission of capacity build through their direct involvement in the management process.

AB Sustainable use of water and land resources requires that these scarce resources be appropriately allocated among various competing human activities. Worldwide, there is a realization now that sustainable river basin management should be accorded the highest priority, because it deals not only with technical, but also with ecological and socioeconomic aspects, and thus calls for a multidisciplinary and integrated approach. However, most of the policy and planning documents have either remained silent, or have made only implicit reference to the importance of environmental water demand (EWD) and its quantification. Therefore, in the light of its importance, a methodology has been evolved in this article for quantifying EWD for various forested areas in two distinctly different Indian river basins: Brahmani (humid zone) and Sabarmati (dry zone). The article analyzes and discusses EWD estimates at three different spatial levels: river basins, states, and districts within them, and finally presents a comparative analysis of all these results. Findings of the present study will be immensely useful in understanding various ecological issues connected with water resource projects and proposals in these river basins.

   China; wetland reclamation
ID COVER; DELTA; AREA
AB Agricultural activities, especially reclamation, are considered major threats to the wetland ecosystems in Sanjiang Plain, the largest concentrated area of the freshwater wetlands in China. In the past decades, the area of the cultivated land and its grain production have been increased at the cost of wetlands shrinkage. The large-scale land reclamation severely affected the ecosystems in this region. However, such effects at the regional scale are seldom evaluated quantitatively. We used three datasets of LANDSAT MSS and/or TM imagery to estimate the area changes and the transition of land use types from 1980 to 2000. We also valued changes in ecosystem services delivered by each land category using value coefficients published by Costanza et al. [Nature 387, 1997, 253-260]. Sensitivity analysis suggested that these estimates were relatively robust. Finally, the contribution of various ecosystem functions was ranked to the overall value of the ecosystem services in this study. According to our estimates, the total annual ecosystem service values in Sanjiang Plain have declined by about 40% between 1980 and 2000 ($ 156284-182572.18 million in total over 20 years). This substantial decline is largely attributed to the 53.4% loss of wetlands. For individual ecosystem functions, waste treatment, water supply and disturbance regulation account for more than 60% to the total ecological values. During those two decades, the contribution of disturbance regulation, cultural and recreation decreased, while the contribution of water regulation, nutrient cycling, food production, raw materials and climate regulation increased during the same period. We also put forward a few proposals concerning the future land use policy formulation and sustainable ecosystems. They are adjusting the 'food first' agricultural policy, establishing more nature reserves for wetlands, creating systems for the rational use of water, harnessing the degraded cultivated land and encouraging eco-tourism.

AB The traditional expected-net-present-value methods cannot properly capture the management flexibility and strategic value aspects of a fishery, and may understate its value. Instead, this paper develops a Real Options model to conceptualize and evaluate fishery exploitation flexibility. Specifically, general models to value the opportunity to either exploit or invest in a fishery are presented. They suffice to determine not only these values, but also the optimal policy for opening, closing, delaying and setting its harvest rate. The sustainable case in which the harvest rate equals the natural net growth function is also considered. Concerning the exploitation decision, it is found that, as could be expected, the higher the resource price the higher the value of this opportunity in both models (general and sustainable). However, the resource stock affects both models differently. As to the investment opportunity, its value is always lower than the exploitation opportunity because of investment costs. Finally, numerical simulations are run in order to illustrate the nature of the solution. Sensitivity analysis concerning the influence of the tax rate, convenience yield, risk-free interest rate and price volatility on the value of the fishery is also reported.

AB This paper argues that the vision of a fundamental clash between a Homo economicus self-interested perspective, dominant in neoclassical economics, and an environmental limit discourse and duty based perspective, central to ecological economics, is an ineffective route towards facilitating effective environmental policy. An evolution to refocus both perspectives towards finding a common ground faces intense resistance from entrenched positions. A conceptual exploration of the roots of such resistances is discussed and an alternative, but complimentary process that addresses the need for and process of a synthesis of conflicting approaches is proposed. As an exemplar of this argument, the Porter hypothesis is used as a guiding framework of how ecological economics as an action oriented paradigm can increase its influence as a policy guide avoiding confrontational policy contexts.

AB This article explores how research funding agencies have responded to the challenge of operationalising the policy agenda of sustainable development. Drawing on the results of a research project studying Swedish funding agencies' policy declarations, mandates and priorities as well as abstracts from funded projects, we analyse how the research domains of sustainable development are defined as well as what type of research projects they support.
   The article discusses consequences for the internationally emerging field of science for sustainable development. We conclude that even though economic and social aspects have been increasingly recognised, agencies predominantly emphasise the environmental dimension of sustainable development. The agencies characterise environmental research in terms of basic research and sustainable development research as applied. As a consequence, sustainable development research has become heavily oriented towards implementing the dominant political agenda. Such short-term political utility is interpreted by the funding agencies as applied research. A worrying consequence is that many fundamental questions posed within the area of sustainable development receive little or no attention in the funding agencies' priorities. Such neglected research domains include those that posit alternative framings, identify potential problems and reflect on implications of current sustainable development policy.

AB Economic incentive programs are increasingly promoted in the United States and Europe as a method to encourage sustainable forest management practices on privately owned lands. This paper employs spatial analysis to evaluate the effectiveness of one such program created in Illinois through passage of the Illinois Forestry Development Act (IFDA). The Act establishes economic incentives available to private landowners who develop forest management plans and/or establish tree plantings. This paper provides (1) a description of the Illinois Forestry Development Act and its associated incentive program and (2) an evaluation of the program's land enrollments in respect to their potential for improving surface water quality. In order to evaluate the legislation in terms of water quality benefits, this paper develops a novel analytical approach utilizing a geographic information system (GIS) and high-resolution digital satellite imagery to locate and characterize land parcels enrolled in the IFDA landowner assistance program. The program has done well in enrolling lands located on steep slopes and has been moderately successful at enrolling lands within environmentally impaired watersheds. There is room for improvement in enrolling lands within the riparian areas of impaired waterways. However, the ability to enroll new lands in the program is limited by the program budget.

TI Location and distribution of internet firms in Germany
SO ERDKUNDE
LA German
DT Article
AB Location and distribution of internet firms in Germany It is widely accepted that technological innovations affect regional economic growth. This paper analyzes the spatial distribution of firms concerned with Internet production and services in Germany. The locations of these-most probably young-firms were studied on the basis of address data on municipality level for the years 1997, 1999 and 2002, using a Geographical Information System. Results indicate a high concentration of firms in certain large agglomerations. Empirical indices show that the presence of a sufficient number of young male people, the contact to other entrepreneurs, a high quality of life and parity power are strong related to the number of internet firms. Centres of highest concentration, which can be seen as sustainable regional innovation systems, are mostly situated in the south and south-west of West Germany whilst internet centres are still lacking in East Germany.

AB An n-pancake graph is a graph whose vertices are the permutations of n symbols and each pair of vertices are connected with an edge if and only if the corresponding permutations can be transitive by a prefix reversal. Since the n-pancake graph has n! vertices, it is known to be a hard problem to compute its diameter by using an algorithm with the polynomial order of the number of vertices. Fundamental approaches of the diameter computation have been proposed. However, the computation of the diameter of 15-pancake graph has been the limit in practice. In order to compute the diameters of the larger pancake graphs, it is indispensable to establish a sustainable parallel system with enough scalability. Therefore, in this study, we have proposed an improved algorithm to compute the diameter and have developed a sustainable parallel system with the Condor/MW framework, and computed the diameters of 16- and 17-pancake graphs by using PC clusters.

AB Exercise critical power (CP) has been shown to represent the highest sustainable work rate (WR) in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD). Parameter estimation, however, depends on 4 high-intensity tests performed, on different days, to the limit of tolerance (T-lim). In order to establish a milder protocol that would be more suitable for disabled patients, we contrasted CP derived from 4, 3 and 2 tests (CP4, CP3 and CP2) in 8 males with moderate COPD. In addition, CP was calculated from 2 single-day tests performed on an inverse sequence (CP2AB and CP2BA): CP values within 5 W from CP4 were assumed as "clinically-acceptable" estimates. We found that [CP4-CP3] and [CP4-CP2] differences were within 5 W in 8 and 6 patients, respectively (95% confidence interval of the differences = -1.3 to 3.5 W and -11.5 to 6.5 W). There was a systematic decline on T-lim when an exercise bout was performed after a previous test on the same day (P < 0.05). Consequently, substantial differences were found between CP4 and any of the CP estimates obtained from single-day tests. In conclusion, clinically-acceptable estimates of CP can be obtained by using 3 or, in most circumstances, 2 constant WR tests in patients with moderate COPD-provided that they are not performed on the same day.

TI Internal brand factors driving successful financial services brands
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MARKETING

DE financial services; brands; brand equity; employees
ID ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE; TRIANGULATION
AB Purpose - Having a successful brand that is integrated and coherent can provide a sustainable competitive advantage. The aim of this paper is to identify internal factors contributing to financial services brand success and ultimately to facilitate better-informed branding activities, thereby growing brand equity.
   Design/methodology/approach - A grounded theory approach is adopted and indepth interviews were carried out with 68 respondents amongst six financial services organisations.
   Findings - The organisations with more successful brands were characterised by the following factors: a holistic, consistent and integrated approach to branding, a focus on excellent and personalised customer service, an ethos which challenges the norm, a responsiveness to change, a high degree of brand literacy, and a synergy between the brand and organisational culture.
   Research limitations/implications - The study was bound by the availability of respondents time. The focus was to examine a relatively small sample of organisations in considerable depth. Moving forward, it is intended that a quantitative study will be undertaken to generalise and expand on these findings within the financial services market.
   Practical implications - A number of significant managerial implications are drawn from this work, for example using the brand ethos model to enable employees to internalise their brand and the use of "brand jigsaw" workshops to facilitate brand consistency.
   Originality/value - The results provide valuable insights into financial services brand management, encouraging the employment of more effective branding techniques within a sector that has traditionally had little interest in branding.

TI Consumption as voting: an exploration of consumer empowerment
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MARKETING
LA English
DT Article
DE consumer behaviour; ethics; consumption
ID ETHICS; CULTURE; BEHAVIOR; MEANINGS; MARKET
AB Purpose - Increasing numbers of consumers are expressing concerns about reports of questionable corporate practices and are responding through boycotts and buycotts. This paper compares competing theories of consumer empowerment and details findings that examine the applicability of the theory to "ethical consumer" narratives. The nature and impact of consumer empowerment in consumer decision making is then discussed.
   Design/methodology/approach - The study takes an exploratory approach by conducting semi-structured in-depth interviews with a purposive sample of ten consumers. These were recruited from an "ethical product" fair in Scotland.
   Findings - Results indicate that the participating consumers embraced a voting metaphor, either explicitly or implicitly, to view consumption as an ethical/political domain. Setting their choices within perceived collective consumer behaviour, they characterised their consumption as empowering. This results in an ethical consumer project that can be seen as operating within the market. It, therefore, suggests some tensions between consumer power and sustainable living.
   Research limitations/implications - This small-scale study relates to a single country and location. A particular group of accentuated consumers was recruited. Studies of the narratives of other consumer groupings would clearly be valuable.
   Practical implications - To the extent that political democracy is perceived as failing, it appears that the profile of the market as a site of consumer engagement is raised. Marketers would be wise, therefore, to take increasingly account of "empowered" consumers.
   Originality/value - Little attention has been paid to the theory of consumption as voting. However, a continuing rise in the consideration of ethics among consumers and producers suggests its rehabilitation and further exploration would be worthwhile.

AB Purpose - The paper explores how the complex relationship between consumption and production evolves as women enact their roles as mothers, and reconstruct their self-identity through their use or avoidance of convenience products.
   Design/methodology/approach - Qualitative, individual interviews are used to allow an in-depth analysis of the life stories of the group of respondents. An interpretive analysis reveals the purpose, patterns and rules followed by these individuals in their actions.
   Findings - Convenience consumption empowers these "mothers of invention" to instrumental and emotional autonomy through their rejection of unnecessary drudgery, and enables them to negotiate the role of caretaker within the family.
   Research limitations/implications - The implications of the study suggest that there is a role for marketing to remove any vestiges of guilt in convenience consumption by addressing the issues of sustainability, nutrition, quality and value in convenience products. Future research should investigate whether these findings resonate cross-culturally and across broader socio-economic groups.
   Originality/value - The paper reveals the importance of reinforcing the connections between a better quality of family care and love. The paper also demonstrates the importance of the interactions of the family members on convenience consumption. These findings are important for marketing practitioners and academics researching family consumption.

AB A very high ventilatory response to hypoxia is believed necessary to reach extreme altitude without oxygen. Alternatively, the excessive ventilation could be counterproductive by exhausting the ventilatory reserve early on.
   To test these alternatives, 11 elite climbers (2004 Everest-K2 Italian Expedition) were evaluated as follows: 1) at sea level, and 2) at 5,200 m, after 15 days of acclimatisation at altitude. Resting oxygen saturation, minute ventilation, breathing rate, hypoxic ventilatory response, maximal voluntary ventilation, ventilatory reserve (at oxygen saturation=70%) and two indices of ventilatory efficiency were measured.
   Everest and K2 summits were reached 29 and 61 days, respectively, after the last measurement. Five climbers summited without oxygen, the other six did not, or succeeded with oxygen (two climbers). At sea level, all data were similar. At 5,200 m, the five summiters without oxygen showed lower resting minute ventilation, breathing rate and ventilatory response to hypoxia, and higher ventilatory reserve and ventilatory efficiency, compared to the other climbers.
   Thus, the more successful climbers had smaller responses to hypoxia during acclimatisation to 5,200 m, but, as a result, had greater available reserve for the summit. A less sensitive hypoxic response and a greater ventilatory efficiency might increase ventilatory reserve and allow sustainable ventilation in the extreme hypoxia at the summit.

TI The organisation of time over the life course: European trends
SO EUROPEAN SOCIETIES
LA English
DT Article
DE life course; working time; work life balance
AB Over the last decades, the life course approach has developed into a major research paradigm. The notion of life course provides a common field of research and a heuristic conceptual device aiming at studying individuals trajectories over time. In its modern version, the life course approach can be said to represent a major innovation in our understanding of complex social phenomena, making time, context and process core theoretical dimensions of social behaviour. Most of the research using this approach has stressed the extent to which social structures and individual factors shape the life course of individuals and has focused on the developmental consequences of alternative life trajectories. One of the main features of the life course approach is therefore to recognize the crucial role time plays in our understanding of individual behaviour and structural changes in society. The second important dimension of the life course approach is its attempt to take a holistic view, in that the analysis no longer focuses on isolated specific events, phases or demographic groups as being discrete and fixed but considers the entire life as the basic framework for empirical analysis and policy evaluation. The link between individual trajectories on one hand and historical period, social structures, as well as human agency on the other is also at the core of the life course paradigm. The notion of life course posits therefore that life trajectories are constituted by a palette of sequences of events that are both individually and socially constructed. The main objective of this cross-country comparative paper is to analyse to which extent the design of national welfare state regimes shape households' patterns of labour market integration over the life course. An analysis of the various national regulatory frameworks, with special focus on institutional opportunities and/or barriers to combine paid work with other social activities, is provided. Special attention is also given to companies' human resource and time management and whether human resource strategies encompass a life course perspective. By linking the specificity of the various regulatory and social protection systems to the country's current patterns of labour market integration the authors not only examine the impact of the overall institutional framework on time allocation over the life course but, also the extent to which the current working time options actually affect the sustainability of the social protection systems. Finally, in the conclusion, some policy implications are suggested with a special focus on the needs of finding new forms of time organisation and distribution of income over the life course. According to the authors these new forms of time management might contribute to a better work life balance for employees and might favour positive compromises between firms' productive efficiency and employees' needs for a larger control on their time structures over their life course.

ID INFORMAL CARE; COSTS
AB As the number of older people in need of long-term care increases, efforts to support older people remaining in their home are intensified in most OECD countries. In this context, there is a movement towards allowing more individual choice for older people receiving publicly funded long-term care at home. Having more flexibility in terms of how to receive care can increase the older person's self-determination and that of his/her informal caregivers. Having a choice among alternative care providers can empower older people as consumers and may help strengthen the role of households in the care-management process. The main aims of this article are (i) to categorise and analyse different types of arrangements allowing home care users more choice and map the prevalence of such arrangements in OECD countries, (ii) to give an overview of some country-specific outcomes in terms of care quality for care recipients, and (iii) to discuss some implications for employment and fiscal sustainability.

AB To develop a rat model of ascending cholangitis, we constructed a controllable and accessible biliary drainage and infusion system. We first modified a reversible cholestasis model of the rat and then induced ascending cholangitis by administration of Escherichia coli into the proximal choledochostomy tube. After biliary infusion of E. coli, the liver, choledochostomy tube and bile were all positive for E. coli, but no bacteria grew in rats receiving biliary infusion of normal saline. Retrograde cholangiography of the initial choledochostomy ensured that the tube end was in the right position in the proximal common bile duct. The patency of the tube-tube choledocho-choledochostomy was confirmed by a cholangiogram on day 90. Thirty days after the tube-tube choledochocholedochostomy, the livers of the experimental animals did not differ from the control livers. The tube-tube choledocho-choledochostomy model not only provides reproducible, reliable, reversible cholestasis, but creates a sustainable and accessible biliary infusion system. This can be used for long-term investigations of repeated cholangitis and recurrent cholestasis.

TI Gravity monitoring of CO2 storage in a depleted gas field: A sensitivity

DT Article
DE CO2; sequestration; gravity; monitoring and verification
AB In 2006, the Cooperative Research Centre for Greenhouse Gas Technologies (CO2CRC) plans to undertake (subject to receiving the necessary approvals) a Pilot program for CO2 storage within a depleted gas reservoir. The Otway Basin Pilot Program (OBPP) aims to demonstrate that subsurface CO2 storage is both economically and environmentally sustainable in Australia. This will be the first CO2 storage program in the world to utilise a depleted gas reservoir and, hence, the experience gained will be a valuable addition to the range of international CO2 storage programs that are underway or being planned.
   A key component of the OBPP is the design of an appropriate geophysical monitoring strategy that will allow the subsurface migration of the CO2 plume to be tracked and to verify that containment has been successful. This paper presents the results from modelling the predicted gravity response to CO2 injection into the Otway Basin reservoir, where the goal was to determine minimum volumes of CO2 that may be detectable using non-seismic geophysical techniques. Modelling results indicate that gravity measurements at 10 m spacing within the existing observation well and the planned CO2 injection well would provide excellent vertical resolution, even for the smallest CO2 volume modelled (10 000 tonnes), but resolving the lateral extent of the plume would not be possible without additional wells at closer spacing.

AB A major operational change in exotic pine plantations of subtropical Australia has been the decision to retain postharvest residues on site. A long-term field experiment was established in February 1996 to examine the impacts of residue management regimes [i.e. the postharvest residues removed (GOR), natural amount of residues retained (GIR) and residue quantity doubled and retained (G2R)] on tree growth (F1 hybrid pine) and sustainable soil management. Twelve soil samples, which included the above three residue regimes with four replicates, were collected at plantation age 6.4 years. A 16S rRNA gene clone library was established following soil community DNA extraction, polymerase chain reaction amplification and cloning. A total of 324 clones, including 27 from each sample, were randomly selected and sequenced to represent the bacterial composition and diversity of the clone library and thus the soil bacterial community under the residue management regimes. Phylogenetic analyses indicated that Acidobacteria (37.6%) and Proteobacteria (35.6%) were the dominant components of the soil bacterial community, followed by Actinobacteria (14.7%), Chlamydiae/Verrucomicrobia (7.3%), Unclassified Bacteria (3.8%) and Gemmatimonadetes (1.0%). Analysis of molecular variance revealed that there was no significant difference in bacterial composition and diversity among the residue management regimes or their replicated samples.

AB Violence in the world, explosive population growth, uneven and unfair distribution of wealth, destruction of the environment and/or the ineffectiveness of supranational political and economic tools and institutions and other problems are more and more achieving global character.
   The growth of number, frequency and intensity of global problems and threats is a reality. In the same time it represents a big challenge: How to find a generally acceptable, adequate global solution? The majority of political and intellectual leaders around the world acknowledge concept of sustainable development/sustainable living as the most important tool for protecting the biosphere and how to secure reasonable development for the future.
   The development and implementation of the sustainable living concept is driven by the effort to reach - as much as possible - the ideals of humanism and the harmony between man and nature, based on the respect of life.
   Values compatible with a sustainable way of living are a set of values, the implementation of which promote the shift towards sustainable future. These values are not completely new. Just the opposite. They create the core of the common heritage of humankind, since the oldest religious cultures.
   The submitted study tries to map the recent developments of values compatible with the sustainable way of living problematic from Czech, Slovak and thinkers from abroad perspectives in the wider framework of relevant international activities.

SO FINANCE A UVER-CZECH JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS AND FINANCE
LA English
DT Article
DE fiscal sustainability; generational accounting
AB The generational accounting approach used in this paper incorporates projected demographic development and the parameters of current Czech fiscal policy into an intertemporal government budget constraint. Compared with public-debt and deficit data, the economic indicators based on generational accounting are forward looking and yield additional information about fiscal policy.
   To assess the sustainability of Czech public budgets, the authors constructed the first set of generational accounts for the Czech Republic. They found that, for 2004, a representative agent obtained more benefits than paid taxes; that is, the generational account of the representative agent was negative. In addition, the total amount of government liabilities resulting from the current fiscal policy, projected to 2150, was estimated at about 300 percent of the national GDP in 2004. The authors conclude that Czech fiscal policy is not sustainable; current taxes and benefits should be modified in line with demographic projections in an effort to stabilize public budgets.

ID DEMAND ELASTICITIES; GASOLINE DEMAND; SUSTAINABILITY; TAXES
AB With mounting concern about current social and environmental challenges, the notion of sustainable development-a paradigm calling for the integration of economic, social, and environmental goals-has gained increasing popularity in recent years. Within the transportation arena, sustainability advocates have argued for reducing reliance on the private automobile and seeking instead to foster alternative modes such as transit, biking, and walking; and many cities are actively pursuing this goal. Yet even the most concerted local efforts can be undermined by contradictory policy frameworks at higher levels of government, and a recent proposal for transportation finance reform in California serves as a good case in point. Intended to enhance the reliability of highway revenues, the proposal would eliminate a 5% sales tax on gasoline and replace it with a 0.25% increase in the general sales tax specifically earmarked for transportation. Basic economic analysis shows clearly, however, that eliminating the sales tax on gasoline would stimulate additional miles driven within the state, leading in turn to increased highway congestion and vehicle emissions. At the same time, increasing the general sales tax would shift a greater financial burden onto the shoulders of nondrivers from lower-income groups. In short, the recent California proposal, if enacted, would work counter to the three goals of sustainability-economic efficiency, social equity, and environmental responsibility-and surely frustrate local efforts to reduce reliance on the automobile.

AB Small-scale fisheries provide food and income to millions of people worldwide, yet these fisheries are generally poorly documented and their impacts not well understood. Improved documentation of these fisheries is needed to gauge global trends, identify the threats to their sustainability, and assess management options. Combining semi-structured interviews and participant observation, this study provides baseline information about the nature and scale of small-scale fisheries in the Ko Chang archipelago, Thailand, as a first step towards instituting a monitoring and management strategy for the area. Although the area has been designated as a "no-take" Marine National Park, small-scale fisheries have Continued virtually unabated within the park's boundaries. Small-scale fishers living in the park are involved primarily in the shrimp trammel net, squid trap, crab trap, fish gill net, hook-and-line, and reef fish trap fisheries. Small-scale fishing boats operating out of villages on Ko Chang and Ko Maisi Yai worked for an estimated 38,000 days/year and took 330,000 kg/year of target fish and invertebrates, based on extrapolations from interviews. Observed catches of target species were, however, an average of 42-64% lower than fishers' reported catches for the fisheries in which both data collection methods could be used. Such a finding suggests that future monitoring should rely on observational techniques to assess the catches and efforts of small-scale participants. Given the area's status as a national park, regular monitoring of the small-scale fisheries should be undertaken and multiple-use zoning be considered. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Size-related differences in power production and swim speed duration may contribute to the observed deficit of nursing calves In relation to lactating females killed in sets by tuna purse-seiners in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean (ETP). Power production and swim-speed duration were estimated for northeastern spotted dolphins (Stenella attenuota), the species (neonate through adult) most often captured by the fishery. Power required by neonates to swim unassisted was 3.6 times that required of an adult to swim the same speed. Estimated unassisted burst speed for neonates is only about 3 m/s compared to about 6 m/s for adults. Estimated long-term sustainable speed is about 1 m/s for neonates compared to about 2.5 m/s for adults. Weight-specific power requirements decrease as dolphin calves increase in size, but power estimates for 2-year-old spotted dolphin calves are still about 40% higher than power estimates for adults, to maintain the same speed. These estimated differences between calves and adults are conservative because the calculations do not include accommodation for reduced aerobic capacity in dolphin calves compared to adults. Discrepancies in power production are probably ameliorated under normal circumstances by calves drafting next to their mothers, and by employing burst-coast or leap-burst-coast swimming, but the relatively high speeds associated with evasion behaviors during and after tuna sets likely diminish use of these energy-saving strategies by calves.

AB Church forests are sanctuaries for different organisms, ranging from microbes to large animals, which have almost disappeared in most parts of northern Ethiopia. Despite the actual and potential significance of these forests, studies and documented information on their bio-physical features and socio-economic setting are either scanty or totally lacking. A study was, therefore, carried out in seven of these church forests, namely Hiruy, Zahara, Gibtsawit, Gelawdiwos, Dengolt, Debresena and Ascha with the objective of assessing the composition, densities and spatial heterogeneity of soil seed banks. The number of viable seeds in the soil samples, from both germination and sieving, corresponded to a seed bank density down to 9 cm in the soil of 7594 seeds m(-2) at Ascha, 2064 seeds m(-2) at Debresena, 4208 seeds m(-2) at Dengolt, 3158 seeds m-2 at Gelawdiwos, 2754 seeds m(-2) at Gibtsawit, 2759 seeds m(-2) at Hiruy, and 1909 seeds m(-2) at Zahra. The total number of species recorded was 50, representing at least 22 plant families, in the seven church forests, of which 13 were recorded from Ascha, 29 from Debresena, 26 from Dengolt, 19 from Gibtsawit, 22 from Gelawdiwos, 20 from Hiruy and 21 from Zahra. There was a significant difference in seed densities and number of species recovered from the soil seed banks of the seven church forests. Ascha had a significantly higher seed bank density than all other church forests. Dengolt exhibited a significantly higher number of species compared with other church forests. Of the identified species recorded from the seven church forests, 83% were herbs, 11% trees and 6% shrubs. Our results revealed that church forests accumulate large quantities of persistent seeds of herbaceous species in the soil while only five (6%) of the 91 woody species recorded in the standing vegetation of the seven church forests were represented in the soil seed banks. The fact that most of the dominant tree species do not accumulate seeds in the soil suggests that their regeneration from seeds would be prevented by removal of mature individuals in the standing vegetation. The results also provided further evidences that consolidate the conclusions of previous studies, i.e. the future existence of the woody flora characteristic of dry Afromontane areas in Ethiopia depends on the conservation and sustainable utilization of the few remnant natural forests.

AB This study was conducted in the islands of Lake Ziway located in the main Ethiopian Rift Valley in south-central Ethiopia. Its main objective was to investigate the diversity, regeneration status, socio-economic importance and the factors that cause degradation of the plant resources in the islands. A total of 73 releves, measuring 20 x 20m, were established along line transects laid from the central part of each island to the lake edge in eight aspects. Herbaceous species were sampled by using a 2 x 2 m sub-releve laid within each releve. In each releve, the cover/abundance of each species was estimated, woody species were counted, diameter at breast height and height of trees and shrubs and the environmental variables altitude, slope, aspect and position were measured. Participatory Rural Appraisal was employed to generate the socio-economic information. A total of 141 species belonging to 113 genera and 55 families were identified, of which 18.4% were trees, 21.3% trees/shrubs, 12.1% shrubs, 3.5% lianas, 4.3% herbaceous climbers and 40.4% herbs. The overall Shannon diversity and evenness of woody species in the islands were 2.60 and 0.62, respectively. The number of species on the islands correlated with island's size, habitat diversity and degree of human disturbance. The similarity in species composition between the islands was low, indicating that each island has its own unique flora. Nine plant communities were recognized and described. The total density and basal area of the vegetation were 2979 individuals ha(-1) and 191 m(2) ha(-1), respectively. The importance value index and the diameter and height class distribution revealed that some species are threatened and need the highest priority for conservation. The socioeconomic survey showed that the island communities are highly dependent on the natural vegetation for various purposes. On the other hand, the islanders have maintained the soil and vegetation resources for centuries through their indigenous resource management systems and practices. Human population growth coupled with farmland expansion, soil erosion, free grazing and cutting trees for various purposes are the major threats to the vegetation resources in the islands. The implications of the results are discussed and recommendations are suggested for conservation, management and sustainable utilization of the fragile island ecosystems. (c) 2006 Elsevier GmbH.

AB To facilitate a sustainable aflatoxin management system in Indonesia, a simple, rapid and effective Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) test for screening aflatoxin B-1 (AFB(1)) in animal feed and feed ingredients was developed. Anti-AFB(1) polyclonal antibodies were produced against AFB(1)-BSA and AFB(1)-KLH immunogens. Using AFB(1) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) as an enzyme marker in a direct competitive ELISA, an IC50 of 0.859 +/- 0.15 mu g/kg and a detection limit (IC15) of 0.189 +/- 0.06 mu g/kg of AFB(1) were achieved. The assay was highly specific to AFB(1) with very little cross reaction with other aflatoxin congeners (AFB(2) 0.9%, AFG(1) 3.1% and AFG(2) 1.2%) and metabolites. The ELISA was tolerant to methanol (up to 60%) and pH (pH 7.2 - 9.6) without significantly affecting the overall performance and was not affected by interferences from the animal feed and corn samples. Satisfactory recovery results were obtained from the spike and recovery study (77 - 97% recovery for 10 - 252 mu g/kg). A pilot survey conducted on corn and animal feed samples collected from the local feed factories and poultry shops indicated that significant amounts of corn and animal feeds were contaminated by aflatoxin B-1 greater than the MRL (50 mu g/kg).

AB Lupin seeds of different species representing diverse varieties of sweet lupin grown in Poland were investigated. The chemical compositions of lupin isolates and amino acid composition of the proteins, as well as the nutritive values were estimated. No significant differences (P >= 0.05) were observed among lupin isolates in their dry matter, crude fibre or alkaloid contents. The highest protein content (465 +/- 11 g/kg d.m.) was found in seeds from lupins belonging to Lupinus luteus (P <= 0.01), while the highest oil content (ca. 115 g/kg d.m.) was found in Lupinus albus (P <= 0.05).
   All the species examined were characterised by a shortage of methionine, lysine, tryptophan and valine while the level of leucine was satisfactory for most of the species. Yellow lupin was deficient in isoleucine. White lupin was found to be a nutritionally more valuable crop than other species by the standards of nutrition for mature human and animals. Apart from the highest level of amino acids within the crude protein (AA - 97.7 g/16 gN, P <= 0.01), it was found to have a better and nutritionally more beneficial amino acid composition and the highest essential amino acids level (EAA). White lupin was characterised by a higher essential amino acid index (EAAI) as well as chemical score (CS) of restrictive amino acids, and the highest protein efficiency ratio (PER), expressed in terms of the availability of leucine and tyrosine as compared to blue and yellow lupin varieties. White lupin, followed by blue and yellow lupin, was found to be suitable for animal feeding as well as for the production of high-protein concentrates for further food processing and use in animal and human nutrition.

ID ENERGY
AB This paper explores the potential of using exergy analysis to study and compare the environmental impact of food supply chains. The method identifies the links where exergy destruction takes place and shows where improvements are possible to minimize this destruction. The supply chains of three products were investigated: pork mincemeat, novel protein food (NPF) made from dry peas and pea soup. Exergy content and requirements of the various streams, products and processes were calculated for the three chains. As exergy is expressed in one unit, the Joule, the inputs and outputs of each chain are easily comparable. The contributions of the links to the total exergy loss are different in each chain. In the NPF chain, greatest input is required in the processing link whereas for the pork chain, primary processing and transportation require the highest inputs. The NPF chain is only slightly more efficient (1.2 times) than the pork meat chain. Such analyses are also useful in the design and redesign of supply chains. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This paper discusses the development of afforestation policy in Israel during the 20th century and identifies the factors influencing its design and implementation. Analysis of the chronological development of the decision-making process by the organizations involved in afforestation identifies five stages characterized by changing goals and a change in the character of the forest created. During most of the period, planting forests provided a tool for realizing national goals, and a policy that was guided by changing tasks imposed by the officials of the Zionist movement, the British Mandate Authorities and the State of Israel. Afforestation was originally perceived as an agricultural activity, and thereafter as a tool for managing the national land reserve and as an aid for developing settlements. The physical by-products, resulting from applying this policy, have a considerable impact on the present distribution of recreational open spaces and on the size of public land reserves. However, the forests that were planted created a non-sustainable resource, characterized by landscape that is the result of decisions made by different institutions and that was foreign to the local Mediterranean forest. Future afforestation policy needs to further activities that alter the quality of the existing forest resource. It also needs to adapt it to vacationers and further the management of afforested land as a long-lasting resource, as well as its integration into the local natural vegetation and the environmental system.

AB A model is described which proposes that a government's actual forest policy should shift in favour of sustainable forest management and control of deforestation when the effective strength of pressures on policy-makers from internal protectionist groups approaches that of exploitative groups. Effective strength depends on the strength of a group, how well it transmits its pressures and the level of public support, all of which are linked to progress in democratization and pluralization. External pressures may change stated policy but not actual policy. Forest policy evolution is divided into three phases: exploitative (when both actual and stated policies promote exploitation), ambiguous (stated policy promotes sustainable management but actual policy remains exploitative) and sustainable management (both actual and stated policies promote sustainable management). The model is tested by applying it to the Philippines, where a sharp rise in the relative power of protectionist groups and their ability to exert pressures on government, and a significant increase in democracy and pluralism, coincided with a major change in forest policy in 1986. Progress in controlling deforestation and managing forest more sustainably throughout the tropics may therefore depend on similar political changes occurring on a larger scale. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

AB We surveyed members of two nonindustrial private forest (NIPF) owner organizations and non-members in southwest Wisconsin to learn their views and experiences on a range of forest ownership and management issues. The two organizations were the Sustainable Woods Cooperative (SWC) and the Wisconsin Woodland Owners Association (WWOA). Our survey yielded 503 completed questionnaires and a useable response rate of 69.5%. Members and non-members differed little in terms of perceived benefits of forest ownership, concerns over potential barriers to management, recent timber harvest activities and confidence in their management skills. However, members were more likely than non-members to have engaged in a variety of management activities during the last 3 years and more willing to consider future cross-boundary arrangements to benefit land stewardship. Between WWOA and SWC members, there were only two discernable differences, but the organizations are philosophically and structurally different. Given the voluntary nature of participation, no single organization can likely appeal to all owners. Yet, as the importance of landscape-scale management and biodiversity conservation increase, NIPF owner organizations could provide a mechanism for promoting and coordinating cross-boundary forest management practices.

AB A case study of the Natural Forest Conservation Program (NFCP) in the western region of Tianshan Mountain was undertaken between 2001 and 2003. Data on the geographic, climatic, ecological, and social economy background of the study area were collected. The impact of the NFCP on the forest, soil, water, and biodiversity in the study area were analyzed and evaluated. The results show that a complete logging ban in the study area cannot replace sustainable forest management; a more flexible policy should be adopted to resolve technical, social and economic problems associated with the complete and suddenly implemented logging ban. In order to strengthen the long-term sustainability of the NFCP public awareness and funding support China should be increased.

AB The increasing prevalence and/or increasing intensity of large-scale natural disturbance events in forests means that post-disturbance salvage logging is becoming more widespread. Salvage logging can have a wide range of environmental impacts, but some of these are not well known or not well understood by policy makers and natural resource managers. Some of these impacts are briefly summarized in this paper. Improved long-term forest planning needs to be embraced that takes into account the not only the environmental but also the social and environmental impacts of salvage harvesting. Past mistakes and future opportunities associated with salvage harvesting are illustrated by a case study from the Lower Cotter Catchment in south-eastern Australia.

ID QUALITY
AB This study proposes a novel approach for coastal zone management information dissemination, where advantages of spatial based web-technologies are highlighted. Efforts on sustainable development can only be achieved via promoting public awareness, encouraging maximum practicable and timely input, and collaboration with all interested parties on decisions. However, adequate tools for stake-holders, having various social and educational backgrounds, are lacking. The potential of Spatial Information Technologies were highlighted in the project of the Web-Based Halic Information System, where cultural tourism, e-governance, and Coastal Zone Management (CZM) applications are overlapping due to the uniqueness of the project area. The contribution of the presented study is to disseminate the structured, heterogeneous spatial information for varying users in order to enhance the knowledge-based society efforts. Hence, the designed system will aid to promote public awareness on environmental issues.

AB In this study the environmental balance of the industrial district of the Potenza town (Southern Italy) is presented. This study represents the first attempt of analytically evaluating the relationships between the industrial activities, their impacts and environmental quality, setting up a reference document for analysing the monitoring trends and for describing the state of the environment over a chosen time horizon. A careful and appropriate choice of environmental indicators was made, according to the guidelines of the European Environmental Agency and to the Driving Forces-Pressure-State-Impact-Response model (DPSIR). In particular, data on the economic assessment, raw materials, water and energy consumptions, air emissions, waste disposal are presented. These results provide a useful baseline for the evaluation of the state of the environment and its variations over the time horizon and to define the feasibility of environmental policy targets as well as the effectiveness of recovery strategies.

DE Whole Earth Festival (WEF); reusable dishware; special events;
   compostable items
AB The Whole Earth Festival (WEF) is an annual event that takes place on Mothers Day Weekend at the University of California, Davis Quad. One aspect of WEF is an integrated prevention plan to minimize solid waste generation. In the past, the waste reduction plan was based primarily on recycling and composting of festival waste. Implementation of this system included compatible material specifications for event food vendors, modified collection systems and waste sorting. Apart from the above mentioned a large set of reusable dishware was purchased including plates, cups, chopsticks and utensils. Discussed in this paper are the planning, operation and results of the reusable dishware program, which started in 2002. The problem most commonly encountered initially was an insufficient amount of small denominations of currency for deposit refunds. Other issues encountered were the occasional use of disposable products by the vendors when reusable items were not cycled through the system fast enough. When compared to the average of 1998 and 2000, the reusable dishware system in 2005 reduced the overall weight of waste, compost, and recyclables (not including cardboard) by 27, 27, and 36%, respectively; the overall volume of these materials was reduced by 62, 41, and 52%, respectively. The per capita waste generation rate was reduced from 0.22 to 0.19 kg/capita-day. Determined valuable backups of the system include: appropriate biodegradable backup products in case the reusable system fails for any reason; better educational signage on the reusable system and accompanying deposit information for eliminating the loss of dishware from the festival; finally, a dedicated volunteer staff for efficient operation of the reusable dishware system and overall waste management system.

AB In this study, a GIS-based Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) system which was designed and established for all stakeholders in the newly rehabilitated area, Halic (also known as Golden Horn) in the oldest part of Istanbul is introduced. The study also proposes enhancement methods in order to ensure the sustainability. Halic has experienced severe pollution until the recent years. This pollution of the Golden Horn and various proposals for amelioration had been the subject of much research and national policies ever since the 1960's. However, Halic cleaned up completely after a rehabilitation project was instigated by the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality and Istanbul Water and Sewage Administration (ISKI). During the project and several others carried out later, enormous amounts of spatial and non-spatial data involving land and water were produced and used. The full efficiency of the produced data was not achieved, since data and systems were isolated. Hence, the main objective of this study is to establish a computer based information system for the area of Halic and its surroundings to integrate collected data in a spatial database for ICZM. The system includes several different kinds of data and information involving land and water environments such as census, topography, water quality, hydrology, bathymetry, infrastructure, documentation of cultural and historical values. The developed system is designed for managing these enormous amounts of data as well as sharing by the different level of users.

AB In the area of transport and environment policy, there is widespread acceptance that integrating decisions across sectors are crucial for sustainable development. However, adequate tools are lacking for the integration. The model proposed in this study contributes to these integration efforts. Since the air quality and transportation phenomena have spatial nature, the developed model presents the integration on spatial bases using spatial information sciences. In order to verify the concepts, a pilot project was conducted in the Istanbul Metropolitan Area, at the second bridge. Bridges, connecting Asia to Europe, are under pressure of heavy congestion. Specifically, at the second bridge,, the national and international freight transportation is conducted, hence environmental impacts are higher. Within the developed model, the expansion of transportation infrastructures over years, and their effects to air quality were modeled. The model was utilized and the results were discussed.

AB This paper attempts to provide a synthesis of the existing state of practice in Greece, with respect to the environmental considerations made in the various transport/ traffic studies at the city/municipality level. Furthermore, it attempts an assessment of the suitability and completeness of these considerations by putting emphasis on the analysis of current environmental related processes. At first, it seems necessary that environmental considerations in such studies need to be strengthened, especially from the sustainability point of view. Collection and/or use of suitable data are important, as it is the use of proper tools. Secondly, the lack of any compulsory evaluation phase that would enable authorities and consultants to assess the proposed and implemented measures from the environment's point of view creates the need for additional interventions to the current framework. A new framework for conducting such studies is, therefore, necessary. This framework should address all relevant issues including new specifications for data collection and analysis, environmental considerations and an integrated evaluation methodology.

AB The present research paper is based on a study elaborated in the Laboratory of Environmental Chemistry. The purpose of this study was to gather information and compare the present state in the most important marinas on the coast of Attiki concerning: a) metal pollution and b) provided services and to recommend practices for combination of good environmental quality and economic sustainability of the marinas.
   The marinas studied were: Zea, Mikrolimano, Alimos four marinas of Glyfada, Voula, Vouliagmeni and Olympic Marine in Lavrion. The research was divided in two parts. The first part was the determination of trace metal pollution in these systems. The main trace metals (Pb, Zn. Cu, Cd, Ni, Mn, Fe) were determined in the dissolved and particulate phase and also in sediment samples (Pb, Zn, Cu, Cd, Ni, Mn, Fe, A]). The second part examined the operation of the marinas in connection to the provided services. In order to accomplish this, questionnaires were created and distributed to users of the marinas. Furthermore another type of questionnaire was distributed to the managers or personnel of the marina.

ID OPTIMIZATION MODEL; DESALINATION
AB The problem for the optimal water systems planning is tackled in this work, taking into account environmental considerations and sustainability issues related to the water sources and the water allocation to various users. The developed mathematical model integrates in a systematic way the benefits that can be expected from the water use and the costs of various water supply methods. The model variables include the time-varying water quantities supplied by different water sources, and also the time-varying water quantities being delivered to various users. The model parameters include the capacities of the water supplies, the different demands of the users, the costs of each water supply method and the benefits of the water allocation to different users.
   Model constraints express the demands, the limitations in the capacity of the various water sources, as well as technical specifications that must be followed in the water allocation. Criteria for the water planning optimization and their corresponding mathematical expressions are proposed. The optimization model highlights some interesting aspects of the water systems' planning and operation, such as the most efficient allocation of existing water supplies, even in cases of limited water availability.

DE environmental strategy; environmental organization; 7-S framework;
   strategic posture analysis; Neste
AB This is a follow-up study for an earlier research in which the environmental strategies and organization (ESO) of a Finnish oil company, Neste, during 1960-1991 were studied. This study continues analysing the ESO of Neste during 1992-1998 and its follower, Fortum, during 1998-2004. In 2005 Neste Oil was separated again from Fortum. The seven areas of their ESO - strategy, structure, systems, skills, staff, symbolic behaviour and shared values will be evaluated on a scale: stable, reactive, anticipatory, entrepreneurial and creative.
   The ESO of Neste started to rise in the 1960s from the stable level towards the reactive level in the 1970s and proceeded to the anticipatory level in the 1980s. Neste's ESO developed drastically in the environmental decade of the 1990s. Six of Neste's ESO areas reached the entrepreneurial level then, and the seventh, shared values, was coming closer. Skills had even some creative features.
   Fortum adopted most of Neste's ESO practices, but by the beginning of the 2000s society was demanding most of them anyway. Fortum adopted very few new ESO practices. Hence Fortum's ESO areas remained at the anticipatory level on the average. Skills and structure had some anticipatory features, but in one part of the skills, external communication, as well as in symbolic behaviour the company resorted occasionally to reactive practices.
   Fortum remained at the reactive level in the issues of sustainable development, but it recognised the integration of economic, social and environmental responsibilities as its short-term ESO challenge. Its. other, unrecognised, EOS challenge was management psychological. The new Neste Oil has these environmental strategy and organization challenges to meet.

AB Sustainable management of water resources is one of the greatest challenges facing society in the 21st century. In terms of adequate drinking water supply, ever-increasing population, accompanied by urbanization, has affected one third of the world population. Both Australia and China have identified water resources issues as a priority research area and both countries have been conducting significant R&D activities. They have supported extensive national collaborative efforts to enable the future deployment of large scale water resources management systems. The sharing of data resources, and the experience of managing water resources among practitioners will be invaluable in a collaborative effort to solve the problem of sustainable water resources. A workshop on whole-of-water cycle approach to sustainable management of water resources took place on the Gold Coast, Australia, 4-5 July 2005. The main outcomes of the workshop included the willingness to collaborate among the participants in sharing of data sets and work together towards providing policy advice for sustainable water resources in both countries. It was suggested that a three-stage approach be adopted to study various possibilities of sustainable water resources. The aim of this three-stage approach is to provide analysis and development of management policies for sustainable management of water resources in both countries.

AB Among the long-term energy scenarios identified by major international organizations in order to drastically reduce fossil fuels consumption and to develop a sustainable energy system within the 21st century, the exploitation of desert areas for large-scale renewable energy production, must be seriously considered. Desert areas are characterized by large land availability, with high levels of solar radiation and wind. However, apart from generating costs (which should fall down in future), two main problems have to be faced. First, fluctuations of renewable power availability may lead to electric grid instability, reducing the quality of energy supply. Second, since deserts are typically far from energy-demanding areas, large power transport lines are needed. The system proposed in this paper resorts to the use of liquid hydrogen (LH2) for energy storage, and to the combined transport of electric energy and LH2 With a MgB2 superconducting line. The system allows flexible delivering of energy in electric and chemical form, depending on end-users demands. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Environmental science deals with phenomena in nature caused by human influence. Thus, its objects have material as well as symbolic aspects. Besides, problem oriented research has two main objectives: on the one hand practicing normal science, which is focused on the development in specific scientific disciplines, and, on the other hand, the more or less active involvement in social processes. Thus, its objects have descriptive as well as normative elements. With the help of three examples from environmental research (i.e. ecosystem research, climate impact research, and integrated coastal zone management), it is pointed out that modern environmental research (e.g. socioecological research), within the context of a transdisciplinary sustainability science, analyses such twofold hybrid objects of investigations with a high degree of normativity. As a result, an evaluation of this kind of research has to be oriented on criteria from inside and outside of science.

ID FUTURE
AB In general, the utilisation of renewable resources is regarded as a contribution to sustainable development due to its reduction of environmental burdens and its support of regional development. In this paper we argue that a true contribution to sustainable development can be achieved only by considering the following additional sustainability criteria during product development: service and user orientation, efficiency, recyclability, flexibility and adaptability, fault-tolerance and risk prevention, employment, income and quality of life. From the discussion of these criteria, three key factors are derived: 1. development of quality products; 2. efficient resource use and reduction of environmental loadings; 3. and, economic competitiveness. The article then offers an example of good practice in product development, in which a competitive natural dyeing process was developed that fulfilled the quality requirements of the industy and of consumers, while simultaneously reducing environmental loadings. Finally, there is a presentation of widely applicable sustainability criteria that can be applied in the course of developing products based on renewable resources.

AB The article evaluates and compares impact- and result-oriented management approaches in environmental planning, sustainability strategies, new public management, and development cooperation. In all of these policy fields, some prerequisites for success can be identified. For example, it is crucial that goals are precise, that sufficient funds are allocated and that the process of goal achievement receives political support. The added value of result-oriented management concepts can be identified mainly in the fact that they may markedly enhance process design as well as motivation and cooperation among the stakeholders, rather than ensuring effective problem-solving at the subject level. It is concluded that result-oriented management concepts should be understood as one of several, mutually supportive elements of institutional innovations for sustainable development.

AB Pedagogic interventions in national parks usually aim at fostering the appreciation of wilderness and at providing opportunities for nature experiences. In order to analyse the adequacy of these priorities for Education for Sustainable Development (ESD), we investigate educational interventions offered by Harz National Park in Northern Germany. We argue that nature experiences foster competences needed for sustainable development. in particular, they provide an opportunity to develop, recognize and/or reflect upon norms and values. However, only when combined with factual knowledge and techniques to cope with the ethical and factual complexities and uncertainties of real-world decision-making, the full potential of the nature experience is realised. We develop respective recommendations for the educational practice in national parks. The suggestions account for synergies with curricular education and ESD programs offered by other, extra-curricular providers of educational services.

DT Article
DE case study teaching; integrated regional development; integrated
   sustainability research; participation; planning methodology; polarity

AB Regional planning processes are traditionally structured along administrative sectors, where development issues are mostly discussed in disciplinary groups. This often inhibits innovations beyond sectoral limits. In the polarity field approach, the development challenges of a region are identified in a participatory process and grouped according to underlying polarities that form the thematic focus of workgroups. In this process seemingly isolated topics can be placed into a common viewing frame. In Leben 2014, a comprehensive transdisciplinary case study conducted in the Austrian region of Oberpinzgau, Salzburg, six polarity fields (i.e., "wilderness and culture", "single and together", "inside and outside", "tradition and innovation", "fast and slow", "young and old") were identified as thematic frames for structuring the planning process. Working on polarity fields rather than sectoral topics stimulated innovative outcomes, as it brought together actors who had not communicated much before. The polarity field concept seems to be a promising framework in particular for informal planning and sustainability processes at a regional level.

DE feminist criticism of science; feminist epistemology; gender; gender and
   environment; sustainability
AB Over the last few years the amount of discussions and research on gender and sustainability has increased steadily. These efforts were primarily initiated by the United Notions Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) in Rio de Janeiro in 1992. Beyond the programmatic level of gender justice and empowerment of women, there is an epistemological, conceptual and methodological approach in feminist research that has to be taken into account to generate adequate data of complex living contexts.
   In Germany the discourse on gender and sustainability, which started as a discussion on women and nature/environment, became influenced by the feminist criticism of science and technology and came to be embedded within the political activities of the women's movement. This article focuses on new research qualities that emerge if gender research in social sciences is combined with feminist criticism of science and technology.

ID BEHAVIOR
AB Consumers can make a contribution to sustainable development by showing a demand for green products. ideally, for choosing a product, a consumer would pay attention to the product's values on all environmentally relevant dimensions, which include: agricultural practice, transport distances, packaging, and conservation practices. How do people deal with such a challenge? The experiments reported in this paper explore the environmental evaluations of food products that people make when presented with information about environmentally significant dimensions. The results show that environmental judgments are affected by the way in which a particular product is presented, i.e., whether a given product is presented and evaluated separately (separate evaluation mode) or whether it is presented within a set of other product alternatives and evaluated side by side (joint evaluation mode). Because consumers are highly susceptible to influences of context, they may sometimes arrive at erroneous conclusions about which products are environmentally friendly and which are not. As a consequence, despite their intentions to buy environmentally-friendly products, consumers may, in the end, purchase products that are not environmentally friendly.

AB Despite a commitment to the concept of sustainability, the socioecological transformation in the region of Dessau in Saxony-Anhalt progresses sluggishly. The project Blocked Transition? Creating Thinking and Action Space for Sustainable Regional Development investigates the impediments of moving towards sustainable development in the region through the perspective of gender. The article follows and argues the project's thesis that, based on the results of gender studies, approaches towards new patterns of thinking and action for sustainability can be found.

AB Previous cytochrome B (CytB) mtDNA studies have suggested four species for the opossum genus Philander (four-eyed opossums), three (P. mcilhennyi, P. andersoni and P. opossum) from the Amazon and one (P. frenata) from the Brazilian Atlantic forest. During a faunal survey nine specimens of Philander sp. and four of Didelphis marsupialis were collected in the Mamiraua Sustainable Reserve, Amazonas State, Brazil. Preliminary analyses based on morphology and geographical distributions were not conclusive, suggesting that Philander specimens could belong to either P. andersoni or P. opossum. In order to elucidate the relationship of this taxon to the remaining Amazonian taxa, seven Philander and two Didelphis specimens animals were sequenced for the cytB mtDNA gene and compared to other previously studied taxa. The maximum likelihood (ML), neighbor-Joining (NJ) and maximum parsimony ( MP) consensus bootstrap trees depicted six groups: Didelphis., P. frenata, P andersoni, P. mcilhennyi, P.o. opossum and Philander sp. and Philander canus in a common assemblage supported by significant bootstrap values, suggesting that the Philander sp. from Mamiraua in fact belongs to the species Philander canus.

   IDENTIFICATION
AB The distribution and form of P in soil is central to the sustainability of agricultural practice. This study used sequential fractionation and P-31 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (P-31 NMR) of NaOH-EDTA extracts to examine the influence of pastoral, native (undisturbed) and forest land use on soil P forms in 5 contrasting soils ranging from a Regosol to a Rendzina in Otago, New Zealand. Climatic factors likely to influence soil P distribution were negated by careful site selection. Together with a decrease in soil organic C (31%), total P decreased in forested soils (mean--674 mg kg(-1)) compared to native soils (mean=784 mg kg(-1)). In contrast, the ratio of inorganic to organic P increased (10%) probably due to mineralization of organic P in forest soils, while for pasture soils, accumulation of P in inorganic forms due to P inputs via fertilisers and animal dung was to blame. Investigation of the organic P forms in NaOH-EDTA extracts of each land use by P-31 NMR indicated that diesters were greatest in the native soil (4-12% of total P in spectra), and declined as a proportion of total P in pasture soils and more so in forest soils. This was reflected in a decline of the diester to monoester ratio. However, the ratio was generally greater in forest than pasture soils and attributed to the labile nature of diesters, mineralization of monoesters in forest soils, and an increase in monoesters in pasture soils from inositol phosphates in plant debris. This effect was pronounced in the Regosol due to sandy texture and the preferential accumulation of plant debris in coarse particle size fractions. Due to the depletion of soil P reserves, forest soils in the area should be followed by pasture and well managed fertiliser additions before replanting. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Its empirical focus is two government sponsored 'agri-environment schemes-the Countryside Stewardship scheme and the Environmentally Sensitive Area scheme-which offer financial incentives to farmers and other land managers who agree to undertake environmentally beneficial practices. As a framework for analysis, the paper draws on the notion of 'knowledge culture', with agri-environment schemes represented as an emerging 'policy knowledge culture' that is seemingly distinct, in its approach to knowing nature, from pre-existing 'agrarian knowledge cultures'. Data are derived from two large scale, countrywide surveys of agreement holders in the two agri-environment schemes. These reveal that alongside some resistance to the policy knowledge culture of AES, there is also negotiation and interchange taking place between knowledge cultures, and the policy knowledge culture is adapting to and accommodating aspects of the other. As such, the paper contests the findings of previous studies which assert that the codified knowledge of agri-environment schemes always wins out in the implementation of scheme agreements, with the subsequent marginalisation of other knowledge(s). In turn, it suggests that policy knowledge cultures can give voice to farmers' ways of knowing nature with benefits both for them and nature itself. The paper concludes with some reflections on the extent of knowledge culture transformation and offers some policy recommendations. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper examines how people explain reasons and impacts of environmental change in the low-rain savanna of the central Sudan and mountainous forest lands of northern Thailand. The explanations are analyzed by using the concept of environmental literacy, which refers to the people's ability to grasp the environment and its interactions. The paper aims to study people's conceptions of the environment, which compose one factor in directing their behavior. For the study, rural inhabitants in the State of North Kordofan, the Sudan, and the Chiang Mai Province in Thailand were interviewed.
   It was noted that an individual's capability to understand the environment is alone insufficient to address environmental problems because the efficient alleviation of the problems requires collective actions at all levels, and because of factors beyond an individual's control. However, the results supported the assumption that the local people have knowledge of their environment that may help in developing sustainable environmental management practices. The main advantages of using the environmental literacy concept are argued to be its dynamic and synthetic essence, its link to sustainable behavior, and wide applicability in various contexts within heterogeneous communities.

   society-nature interaction
SO GEOFORUM
LA English
DT Article
DE sustainable development; Russia; Vernadsky; biosphere; noosphere;
   geography
AB Recent Russian legislative and policy documentation concerning national progress towards sustainable development has suggested that the attainment of such a state would represent the first stage in the development of the noosphere as outlined by the Russian scientist Vladimir Ivanovich Vernadsky (1863-1945). This paper explores Vernadsky's model of evolutionary change through a focus on his work on the biosphere and noosphere in an attempt to further understanding of the way in which Russia is approaching the concept of sustainable development in the contemporary period. It is argued that the official Russian interpretation of the noosphere idea tends to obscure the evolutionary and materialist foundations of Vernadsky's biosphere-noosphere conceptualisation. At the same time, the concluding section of the paper suggests that the scope of Vernadsky's work can be used to stimulate the search for a more coherent approach to work in areas of sustainable development and sustainability across the span of the social and physical sciences.

TI Change or collapse? A theoretical approach to global environmental
   change and landuse in rainforest and arid zone hotspots
SO GEOGRAPHISCHE ZEITSCHRIFT
LA German
DT Article
ID POLITICAL ECOLOGY; DEFORESTATION; SUSTAINABILITY; GLOBALIZATION; SYSTEMS
AB The current level of interest in past and possible future collapses of man-environment conditions or systems (civilizations) is high. However, both in the media and in geographical science (including earth system science), the presentation of this issue tends to be popularized and simplified. This paper contrasts the prevailing notions of collapse with the concept of land use transition as a framework that attempts to contextualize the contingent and path-dependent transformation of man-environment relations. The relational concept is explained and tested against both (pre)historic and contemporary evidence of land-use systems moving either towards restoration and innovation or towards deterioration and decline. Contemporary examples of transitions in land-use and land-cover change are drawn from hotspots within the global tropical forest and and zone ecosystems (deforestation, desertification). They are taken from recent data-bases created under the auspices of the international Land-Use/Cover Change (LUCC) project in 1995 to 2005. They are presented in terms of causal clusters associated with the severity, extent and rates of change in areas such as Central Asia and the Brazilian Amazon. In a plea for more critical realism in the analysis of threatening socio-ecological collapse, the type and quality of interventions to encourage more sustainable land-uses are briefly discussed.

ID FILTER; SYSTEM
AB The purpose of this study was to show how the permeability of different types of geotextile behaved when they were subjected to municipal wastewater filtration. The tests were intended to show the clogging potential of geotextiles if they were used for wastewater treatment. The geotextiles filtered organic suspended solids and hosted growth of microorganisms. The test liquid was primary treatment effluent that treated combined sewage ( wastewater plus stormwater runoff). The project used 10.16 cm diameter packed columns containing alternating layers of gravel, sand and geotextile filters. The study included four phases. The first phase was intended to measure the baseline permeability of each geotextile used. The second phase was a screening phase to see how the permeability of woven and nonwoven geotextiles changes when they are subjected to wastewater. Phase III was a parametric study to assess the effects of variables on residual permeability. These variables were the number of geotextile filter layers, the hydraulic loading rate (HLR) or flow rate, and provision for passive re-aeration. It was found in the first two phases that only nonwoven geotextiles with complex structures and high internal porosity retained more biomass yet preserved sustainable permeability. A confirmatory final phase was conducted using the best combination of operating variables indicated by the parametric study. It was shown that these variables influence the residual permeability of the geotextile filters tested. The confirmatory final phase included two layers of continuous filament geotextile filters in a granular matrix of decreasing coarseness with depth, maintaining an unsaturated subgrade, and twice daily dose and drain application of primary treatment effluent at a net rate of 365 L/m(2)/day. With this HLR, the composite filter permeability of 0.925 cm/s was sustained with little loss, 0.2%, whereas the control column with no geotextile layer indicated 13% permeability loss. Scanning electron microscope images showed that the biomass morphology was a discontinuous floc entrapped within the geotextile pore structure.

AB The UN Global Compact epitomizes the current state of the politics of international development in three distinct ways. First, the Compact illustrates a major turn in development thinking. After decades of hostile relations, the UN and business now acknowledge their common interest in the promotion of sustainable development. Second, the Compact brings to light the gradual emergence of more inclusive forms of global governance, in response to the failure of traditional mechanisms of development cooperation. Third, ongoing discussions about the Global Compact attest to the competing worldviews that structure today's development debate. Overall, the Compact demonstrates that, beyond its ever changing dynamics, international development ultimately remains a political, rather than a technical, process.

TI Photocatalytic methanol reforming on Au/TiO2 for hydrogen production
SO GOLD BULLETIN
LA English
DT Article
ID WATER; CATALYST; ETHANOL; GOLD; FUEL
AB Methanol can be reformed with water, at ambient temperature, using photocatalysis, and this reaction represents a possible low energy, more sustainable pathway to hydrogen production than (for instance) steam reforming. The requirements for the catalysts are rather strict since titania itself is almost inactive for anaerobic photocatalysis, whereas the addition of a very limited range of metals to the surface renders it active. Surprisingly, this includes gold, which shows one of the highest reactivities for hydrogen production. The mechanism is proposed to involve the methoxy and formate intermediates, the latter being implicated in the route to CO2 and hydrogen production. One oxygen atom is supplied from the titania support, which is replaced in the catalytic cycle by oxygen from water. The threshold for the excitation is that for bandgap excitation into the titania conduction band, which stores the energy for reactivation, and this is mediated by electrophilic oxygen.

AB The development of new products and materials, especially those which are non-petrolchemical reserves and based on renewable organic resources, using innovative sustainable processes is nowadays of increasing interest and deserves the attention of both academic and industrial research. Cellulose and its derivatives, as renewable organic resources, have been used to synthesize novel superabsorbent hydrogels. Although the production of cellulose is one of the causes connected to deforestation, the production of suitably engineered cellulose superabsorbent hydrogel materials has been proposed to preserve water in typically arid areas in the world. Paradoxically, divinylsulfone (DVS), a small di-functional highly toxic molecule, was used as a crosslinker for the preparation of the hydrogel. An environmentally sustainable heterogeneous TiO2 photo-catalysed process has been performed in order to achieve the detoxification ( and a possible re-use) of washing waters deriving from the purification process carried out after the synthesis of a bio-degradable cellulose based superabsorbent hydrogel. The main species present in the washing water was DVS. DVS is a well known toxic agent and it was efficiently removed along with the unreacted polymers and oligomers by irradiating the washing waters in the presence of suspended polycrystalline TiO2. The photoprocess was studied not only by monitoring the total organic carbon (TOC) present in the solution but also by following the evolution of sulfate anions.

TI Green chemistry and the biorefinery: A partnership for a sustainable
   future
SO GREEN CHEMISTRY
LA English
DT Article
ID CHITOSAN; SUZUKI
AB Research into renewable bioresources at York and elsewhere is demonstrating that by applying green chemical technologies to the transformation of typically low value and widely available biomass feedstocks, including wastes, we can build up new environmentally compatible and sustainable chemicals and materials industries for the 21st century. Current research includes the benign extraction of valuable secondary metabolites from agricultural co-products and other low value biomass, the conversion of nature's primary metabolites into speciality materials and into bioplatform molecules, as well as the green chemical transformations of those platform molecules. Key drivers for the adoption of biorefinery technologies will come from all stages in the chemical product lifecycle (reducing the use of non-renewable fossil resources, cleaner and safer chemical manufacturing, and legislative and consumer requirements for products), but also from the renewable energy industries (adding value to biofuels through the utilisation of the chemical value of by-products) and the food industries (realising the potential chemical value of wastes at all stages in the food product life cycle).

AB Onion waste is a renewable raw material, rich in different molecular species of the antioxidant quercetin. To utilize this resource, an environmentally sustainable procedure has been developed, using pressurized hot water to extract the quercetin species, followed by biocatalytic conversion of the quercetin glycosides to quercetin and carbohydrates. Two different recombinantly expressed thermostable beta-glucosidases, Thermotoga neapolitana beta-glucosidase A and B, were utilized as catalysts. These enzymes maintain activity at temperatures around 90 degrees C, and are therefore ideal to use in combination with hot water extraction. Our results, based on experimental design, showed that they converted quercetin glycosides to active quercetin in less than 10 min reaction time in water at 90 degrees C, pH 5.0. Experimental design showed that the optimal extraction conditions included three 5 min extraction cycles with water at 120 degrees C and 50 bars, giving a total extraction time of 15 min. Several different types of quercetin and isorhamnetin glycosides as well as kaempferol were detected in onion waste using LC-MS/MS analysis. After converting the different glycosidic compounds to their respective aglycones, the quercetin content was 10 to 50 mg g(-1) dry weight of onion waste (RSD 8%). In summary, our research demonstrates that subcritical water extraction followed by beta-glucosidase-catalyzed hydrolysis is a rapid method to determine the content of quercetin and isorhamnetin in onion samples, and is environmentally sustainable as it only uses water as solvent and enzymes as catalysts.

AB Mixtures of sugars, sugar alcohols or citric acid with urea and inorganic salts form stable melts if heated to 70 degrees C. The polarity of the melts was estimated using solvatochromic dyes and found to be in the range of DMF or water, depending on the sensitivity of the dye for hydrogen bonds. To explore the use of the melts as solvents in catalysis, Rh-catalyzed hydrogenations and Pd-catalyzed Suzuki reactions were performed. The hydrogenation of a double bond is sensitive to the composition of the melt, and no effect of the chiral melts on the stereochemical outcome of the reaction was observed. The Suzuki coupling proceeds rapidly, cleanly and quantitatively in all examined melts. The results recommend the non-toxic sugar-urea-salt melts as more sustainable reaction media for chemical transformations.

SO GUERRES MONDIALES ET CONFLITS CONTEMPORAINS
LA French
DT Article
AB If the commercial relations between Morocco and the United States are very old, a sustainable political relationship begins to form only during the Second World War (1943) and defines itself afterwards in relationship to French policy, above all after Morocco's independence. The strategic position of Morocco, together with its economic resources, brings the United States to its support : military bases in exchange for economic aid and the first investments. King Mohammed V is sometimes on strained terms with the United States, on account of his political opening to the East and his positions concerning the conflicts in North Africa and the Middle East. King Hassan II, after 1961, reduces these tensions, and Morocco receives multiple aid from the United States. The French diplomatic archives show that France followed this evolution with great attention.

AB U.S. hospitals incur costs of $25-$50 billion annually in providing "community service," primarily in the form of health professions education and standby costs. They also provide approximately $30 billion in uncompensated care. Historically, such "community service" costs have been subsidized explicitly by Medicare and implicitly in the prices paid by private payers. The sustainability of that system is highly uncertain. With a growing number of uninsured patients, allocating nonreimbursable costs to paying customers can create a "death spiral," in which fewer paying customers bear a larger proportion of such costs. The obvious solutions to this problem all have serious limitations.

TI Future costs for long-term care - Cost projections for long-term care
   for older people in the United Kingdom
SO HEALTH POLICY
LA English
DT Article
DE long-term care; projected expenditure; health status; demography; UK
AB The purpose of this paper is to analyse the future sustainability of the UK system for provision of long-term care (LTC) due to changes in demography and health status among the older people. It considers how demand for LTC will evolve and to what extent there will be sufficient supply to meet demand. For formal care, this requires an estimate of how much the public purses, and hence taxpayers, will be burdened with LTC costs. For informal care, it involves estimating whether there will be enough carers if current patterns of provision were to continue. The results show that demand for long-term care will start to take off 10 years from now, and reach a peak somewhere after 2040. The research finds that the most significant increase will be in demand for informal care, where the number of recipients are projected to increase from 2.2 million today to 3.0 million in 2050. Relative increases will be similar in all care settings, amounting to between 30 and 50% compared with the levels today; however, the most noticeable increase will be in demand for formal home care, which is projected to be 60% above current levels by 2040. Total expenditure on formal long-term care will increase from 11 pound billion per year today to approximately 15 pound billion per year by 2040 (in 2001 prices). Expressed in taxation terms the effective contribution rate will increase from around 1.0% of total wages today to 1.3% in 2050. Availability of informal caters is potentially a big problem, but the extent of the problem is very sensitive to the assumptions made concerning health improvements and care-giving patterns.

TI HMIS and decision-making in Zambia: re-thinking information solutions
   for district health management in decentralized health systems
SO HEALTH POLICY AND PLANNING
LA English
DT Article
DE HMIS; information forms; decentralization; strategic decision making;
   district health systems
AB At the onset of health system decentralization as a primary health care strategy, which constituted a key feature of health sector reforms across the developing world, efficient and effective health management information systems (HMIS) were widely acknowledged and adopted as a critical element of district health management strengthening programmes. The focal concern was about the performance and long-term sustainability of decentralized district health systems. The underlying logic was that effective and efficient HMIS would provide district health managers with the information required to make effective strategic decisions that are the vehicle for district performance and sustainability in these decentralized health systems.
   However, this argument is rooted in normative management and decision theory without significant unequivocal empirical corroboration. Indeed, extensive empirical evidence continues to indicate that managers' decision-making behaviour and the existence of other forms of information outside the HMIS, within the organizational environment, suggest a far more tenuous relationship between the presence of organizational management information systems (such as HMIS) and effective strategic decision-making. This qualitative comparative case-study conducted in two districts of Zambia focused on investigating the presence and behaviour of five formally identified, different information forms, including that from HMIS, in the strategic decision-making process. The aim was to determine the validity of current arguments for HMIS, and establish implications for current HMIS policies.
   Evidence from the eight strategic decision-making processes traced in the study confirmed the existence of different forms of information in the organizational environment, including that provided by the conventional HMIS. These information forms attach themselves to various organizational management processes and key aspects of organizational routine. The study results point to the need for a radical re-think of district health management information solutions in ways that account for the existence of other information forms outside the formal HMIS in the district health system.

AB This paper describes the results of a research project that investigated the ways that academics understand sustainability within their own disciplines. It describes a range of ways in which academics view sustainability in the context of their teaching, and a range of ways they suggest that sustainability could be integrated into their teaching. Its genesis was an industry/university forum held at Macquarie University (Australia) that identified the need to integrate ideas of sustainable development within university curricula in all disciplines to prepare students for their professional roles. At a global level, participants in the 2002 Johannesburg Earth Summit emphatically endorsed the proposal that sustainable development needs to be an integral component of all levels of education. Environmental bodies have often focused their attention on development of materials to support sustainable development within specific environmentally focused disciplines. In contrast, the present project acknowledges that issues of sustainability need to span the whole range of subjects and extend to the development of appropriate curriculum. Real change in thinking about sustainability requires creative pedagogy which acknowledges the different ways that people think about sustainability and provides spaces in which their ideas can be developed.

AB This paper deals with prevention of human errors by proper road planning, road design, and improvement of existing roads within the framework of the Dutch Sustainable Safety vision. This vision focuses on three design principles for road networks and for roads and streets: functionality, homogeneity, and predictability. The ambition is to reduce considerably the number of crashes and casualties and maintain the Netherlands as one of the countries with the best road safety records. This vision was launched at the beginning of the 1990s and accepted as a formal part of Dutch policies in the mid-1990s. It resulted in a so-called Start-Up Program on Sustainable Safety, not only addressing the planning and design of road infrastructure but strongly emphasizing those aspects. Contents of the start-up program are described as the process leading to implementation. An overview presents different (road infrastructure) components of the start-up program and the estimated effects on road crashes. These components are functional road classification, 30-km/h zones and 60-km/h zones, safety of two-wheelers, and roundabouts. Evaluation studies suggest a 6% reduction in the number of fatalities and hospitalizations. Lessons learned will be used in defining the next phase. The start-up program has been used to draft new guidelines and recommendations for road planning and road design. An introduction of that is given. Finally, some thoughts are given about the next phase: how to proceed under circumstances in which fewer public funds will become available.

TI Historical argumentations in the German debates on birth decline and
   differential fertility. Case example Karl Valentin Mueller (1896-1963)
SO HISTORICAL SOCIAL RESEARCH-HISTORISCHE SOZIALFORSCHUNG
LA German
DT Article
AB Since the discovery of birth-rate decline in the 19(th) century, this demographic phenomenon has been closely linked with differential fertility as a central topic in historical demography and the history and theory of population. In the studies of the social anthropologist and sociologist Karl Valentin Muller, explanations of birth-rate decline and differential fertility likewise held a prominent place. Since the 1920s he based his understanding of population and class questions on theorems that had emerged in German debates on the "agrarian versus industrial nation" in the 1890s. Asking always the same question about the relationship between biological worth and social position, Muller believed he had discovered an elite class of workers, whose roots he located in the crafts of the late Middle Ages. According to him, this group constituted an independent class within the capitalist labour force because of the constancy of their hereditary biology and their social connubium. With his selective understanding of history, Muller pointed to a powerful relationship between historical and future developments and identified dangers arising from differential fertility, the essence of racial hygiene. To prevent these problems, he formulated what he believed to be a sustainable population and racial policy - a well-planned breeding of the social-biological qualities of the worker elite. After the political break in 1933, he constructed a "breeding model" according to the hereditary biological politics of Walter Darre. Shortly thereafter, proceeding from a hereditary biological historicization of early migrations of "racially affined" peoples, Muller presented an NS-affined population-restructuring program for Bohmen and Mahren. After 1945, he abandoned part of his rhetorical repertoire and shifted his work to research on refugees and intelligence. He nonetheless remained true to his basic idea of a genetically determined elite.

AB The practice of providing postpurchase assistance to homeowners once they are in their homes has been generating increased interest in efforts to preserve the homeownership gains of the,past few years. In this article, we document the current state of the postpurchase services industry and identify the essential components of foreclosure prevention and sustainable homeownership programs-the two major types.
   Taken together, these essential components provide a framework for the full range of services these programs can provide and identify what needs to be measured in order to evaluate them. This article is based on insights gathered from interviews with national experts and site visits to or extensive phone interviews with nine nonprofits that operate postpurchase homeownership programs.

AB The effects of biomanipulation were studied in ten Finnish lakes to determine responses in fish and plankton communities and water quality after mass removal of cyprinids. From 1997 to 2001, the fish communities shifted from the dominance of large cyprinids to an explosion of small cyprinids and a higher proportion of piscivores in effectively biomanipulated lakes (> 200 kg ha(-1) 3 yr(-1)). The biomass of cyanobacteria decreased, and the duration of the blooms shortened and shifted towards the autumn. Decreased concentrations and slower cycling of nutrients and increased grazing by cladocerans probably affected the declined biomass of cyanobacteria. Less intensive sediment disturbance and increased phosphorus-retention in fast growing fish biomass may have turned the role of the fish assemblage from 'nutrient recycler' to 'nutrient storage'. Increased potential grazing pressure, higher proportion of edible algae, and lower chlorophyll a: total phosphorus ratio indicated strengthened herbivore control. A high mass removal catch in relation to trophic state, low background turbidity, and bearable external loading favoured the successful biomanipulation, whereas intensive cyprinid reproduction, high nutrient loading and non-algal turbidity hindered the recovery. Three important issues should be noticed before biomanipulation in Finland: (1) careful selection of target lake, (2) well-planned, effective and long-lasting biomanipulation and (3) sustainable management of piscivores.

TI Virtual water trade: an assessment of water use efficiency in the
   international food trade
SO HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
ID RESOURCES; SCARCITY
AB Amid an increasing water scarcity in many parts of the world, virtual water trade as both a policy instrument and practical means to balance the local, national and global water budget has received much attention in recent years. Building upon the knowledge of virtual water accounting in the literature, this study assesses the efficiency of water use embodied in the international food trade from the perspectives of exporting and importing countries and at the global and country levels. The investigation reveals that the virtual water flows primarily from countries of high crop water productivity to countries of low crop water productivity, generating a global saving in water use. Meanwhile, the total virtual water trade is dominated by green virtual water, which constitutes a low opportunity cost of water use as opposed to blue virtual water. A sensitivity analysis, however, suggests high uncertainties in the virtual water accounting and the estimation of the scale of water saving. The study also raises awareness of the limited effect of water scarcity on the global virtual water trade and the negative implications of the global water saving for the water use efficiency and food security in importing countries and the environment in exporting countries. The analysis shows the complexity in evaluating the efficiency gains in the international virtual water trade. The findings of the study, nevertheless, call for a greater emphasis on rainfed agriculture to improve the global food security and environmental sustainability.

TI The protective and attractive covering of a vegetated embankment using

SO HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES

ID EROSION CONTROL-SYSTEMS; INDIA
AB This paper presents the results of a field experiment conducted in Kerala, South India, to test the effectiveness of coir geotextiles for embankment protection. The results reveal that treatment with geotextile in combination with grass is an effective eco-hydrological measure to protect steep slopes from erosion. In the context of sustainable watershed management, coir is a cheap and locally available material that can be used to strengthen traditional earthen bunds or protect the banks of village ponds from erosion. Particularly in developing countries, where coir is abundantly available and textiles can be produced by small-scale industry, this is an attractive alternative for conventional methods. This paper analyses the performance of coir geotextile in different treatments with respect to soil moisture content, protection against erosion and biomass production.

AB Wood specific gravity (SG) was analysed from wood cores of 180 individuals belonging to 58 common upper canopy tree species of late successional white water (varzea) forests in the Mamiraua Sustainable Development Reserve, Central Amazon Basin. We tested for a SG gradient of trees along the flood gradient. Mean SG in the low varzea was 0.62 g cm(-3), in the high varzea 0.57 g cm(-3). SG tended to increase with height and duration of flooding. In the two species that occurred in both forest types (Hevea spruceana, Tabebuia barbata) SG was significantly lower in the high varzea trees. Therefore, height and duration of flooding seem to be important factors influencing growth and wood properties in varzea trees. In addition, SG variation depended on the core section and to a lesser extent on tree diameter and height. Compared to trees in Amazonian upland ecosystems, SG of the varzea trees was lower than SG in Central and Eastern Amazonian terra firme, but was within the same range reported for Western Amazonian terra firme.

ID AFRICAN PELAGIC FISHERY; COD STOCK; OBJECTIVES; ADVICE
AB Current scientific management objectives for ICES roundfish stocks are to ensure conservation of the biological resource and do not explicitly consider economic or social objectives. For example, there are currently no objectives to maximize the sustainable yield or to reduce variability in total allowable catches (TACs). This is despite the fact that the current system can result in wide annual fluctuations in TAC, limiting the ability of the fishing industry to plan for the future. Therefore, this study evaluated management strategies that stabilized catches by setting bounds on the interannual variability in TACs. An integrated modelling framework was used, which simulated both the real and observed systems and the interactions between system components. This allowed the evaluation of candidate management strategies with respect to the intrinsic properties of the systems, as well as our ability to observe, monitor, assess, and control them. Strategies were evaluated in terms of risk (measured as the probability of spawning-stock biomass falling below a biomass threshold for the stock) and cumulative yield. In general, bounds on interannual TAC change of 10% and 20% affected the ability to achieve management targets, although the outcome of applying TAC bounds could not have been pre-judged because results were highly dependent on the specific biology of the stock, current status, and the interaction with assessment and management. For example, for North Sea haddock, management became less responsive to fluctuations resulting from large recruitment events. Simulated target fishing mortality levels were rarely achieved, regardless of the TAC bound applied, and actual fishing mortality rates oscillated around the target. In the longer term, more restrictive bounds resulted in oscillations of greater amplitude and wavelength in yield and SSB. Bounds had less effect when a stock was close to the biomass corresponding to the target F. Risk for stocks that are declining or currently at low abundance may be greater, because if bounds restrict the extent to which TACs can be reduced each year, they could lead to collapse of the stock and the loss of all future revenue. However, for a recovered stock or one at high abundance, the loss of yield as a result of bounds would be smaller than that caused by the total collapse of the fishery. At low stock size or if the stock was declining, catches should be changed more rapidly than when the stock was increasing or at a high level, especially high stock sizes acting as an insurance against uncertainty. Therefore, rebuilding strategies, and strategies aimed at maintaining the stock above prescribed limits, should be considered separately.

AB We analyse the multi-annual evolution of bathymetry along several cross-sections of the Kwintebank (one of the Flemish Banks). An important issue in the area is the intensive exploitation under regulations imposed by the Belgian authorities that aim to guarantee sustainability of extractions. All bathymetric data collected during the period 1987-2000 at a frequency of approximately four surveys per year are analysed, to identify volumetric temporal trends. The errors inherent in the measurements taken with a single-beam instrument are examined. The lack of indisputable quality criteria led to the choice of robust statistical methods. A statistically significant annual decline of approximately 1.5% in bank volume is shown. Another practical conclusion is that a big increase in sampling frequency is necessary if the authorities set a criterion regarding the long-term sustainability of the bank and wish to have a swift guarantee that this criterion is being observed.

TI MPC as a tool for sustainable development integrated policy assessment
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATIC CONTROL

DT Article
DE stochastic model predictive control (MPC); sustainable development
AB A recent stochastic and multiobjective formulation based on static open-loop optimization has laid the foundations of a quantitative approach to sustainable development policy assessment. Here, the connections between such an approach and model predictive control are explored, and a reformulation that introduces dynamics and addresses closed loop performance and stability is proposed. The approach has wide applicability but it is hoped that it will provide sustainable development practitioners in particular with new insights.

AB Millions of end-of-life (EOL) electronic products represent more than one million tons of engineering thermoplastics. The economically and environmentally sound recovery of engineering thermoplastics from EOL electronics is a challenge to the sustainability of electronics manufacturing. In this paper, we review the technologies to separate and identify pure post-consumer plastics from EOL electronics, which are followed by the comparison of electronic plastics recycling processes and the network models for plastics recycling processes. We also review successful plastics recycling practices for electronics. In addition, further research directions for recycling plastics from EOL electronics are discussed.

DT Article
AB Data published in IMF country reports and International Financial Statistics (IFS) may differ for seemingly identical variables, and at times users may be unaware of the reasons underlying such differences and may lack the information needed to permit reconciliation. This paper presents a study of the consistency of annual data on core statistical indicators presented in the IFS and a sample of country reports. The paper finds a significant incidence of apparent discrepancies for similarly defined variables. It discusses the reasons for differences and examines the implications for research using an example from the debt sustainability literature.

TI Primary surplus behavior and risks to fiscal sustainability in emerging
   market countries: A "fan-chart" approach
SO IMF STAFF PAPERS
LA English
DT Article
ID PANEL-DATA MODELS
AB This paper proposes a probabilistic approach to public debt sustainability analysis (DSA) using ''fan charts." These depict the magnitude of risks-upside and downside-surrounding public debt projections as a result of uncertain economic conditions and policies. We propose a simulation algorithm for the path of public debt under realistic shock configurations, combining pure economic disturbances (to growth, interest rates, and exchange rates), the endogenous policy response to these, and the possible shocks arising from fiscal policy itself. The paper emphasizes the role of fiscal behavior, as well as the structure of disturbances facing the economy and due to fiscal policy, in shaping the risk profile of public debt. Fan charts for debt are derived from the "marriage" between the pattern of shocks on the one hand and the endogenous response of fiscal policy on the other Applications to Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, South Africa, and Turkey are used to illustrate the approach and its limitations.

ID ECOLOGY
AB First we remind general considerations concerning biodiversity on earth and particularly the loss of genetic biodiversity that seems irreversible whether its origin is directly or indirectly linked to human activities. Urgent and considerable efforts must be made from now on to cataloge, understand, preserve, and enhance the value of biodiversity while ensuring food safety and human and animal health. Ambitious integrated and multifield research programs must be implemented in order to understand the causes and anticipate the consequences of loss of biodiversity. Such losses are a serious threat to sustainable development and to the quality of life of future generations. They have an influence on the natural balance of global biodiversity in particularly in reducing the capability of species to adapt rapidly by genetic mutations to survive in modified ecosystems. Usually, the natural immune systems of mammals (both human and animal), are highly polymorphic and able to adapt rapidly to new situations. We more specifically discuss the fact that if the genetic diversity of the affected populations is low the invading microorganisms, will suddenly expand and create epidemic outbreaks with risks of pandemic. So biodiversity appears to function as an important barrier (buffer), especially against disease-causing organisms, which can function in different ways. Finally, we discuss the importance of preserving biodiversity mainly in the wildlife ecosystems as an integrated and sustainable approach among others in order to prevent and control the emergence or reemergence of diseases in animals and humans (zoonosis). Although plants are also part of this paradigm, they fall outside our field of study.

   within its pilot phase
SO IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB A key element of the United Kingdom (UK) health policy reform in relation to chronic disease management is the introduction of a national programme seeking to promote self-care from within the National Health Service (NHS). The mainstay of the Expert Patients Programme (EPP) is a six-week training course that provides the opportunity for anyone with a long-term condition to develop new skills to manage their condition better on a day-to-day basis. The course forms part of the NHS self-care support programme, is administered by Primary Care Trusts (PCTs) and delivered by people who have personal experience of living with a long-term condition.
   The NHS' official Expert Patients Programme website presently states that, "Pilot EPP courses began at 26 NHS PCT sites across England in May 2002, and by May 2004 approximately 300 PCTs had either actively implemented pilot courses or had committed to joining. The majority of PCTs are now coming to the end of the pilot phase, with many implementing plans to make EPP sustainable for the long-term." The NHS website heralds the pilot "a success." A national, postal survey of PCT EPP Leads was undertaken in order to examine both the evolvement of EPP during its pilot stage and future plans for the programme.
   A questionnaire was sent out to the 299 PCTs known to have committed to the EPP pilot, and an excellent 100% response rate was obtained over a 3-month period (April-July 2005). One marker of success of the Expert Patients Programme implementation is the actual running of courses by the Primary Care Trusts. This paper explores the extent to which the implementation of the pilot can indeed be viewed as a "success," primarily in terms of the number of courses run, and considers the extent to which PCTs have carried out all that they were committed to do. Findings suggest that the more time an EPP Lead dedicates to the Programme, the more likely it is that EPP has run successfully in the past, and the more likely it is that it will continue to run successfully in the future. Other factors indicating future EPP success include collaborating across PCTs to share co-ordinators, tutors, and funding.

TI Innovations in mental health services implementation: a report on
   state-level data from the US Evidence-Based Practices Project
SO IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB Background: The Evidence-Based Practice (EBP) Project has been investigating the implementation of evidence-based mental health practices (Assertive Community Treatment, Family Psychoeducation, Integrated Dual Diagnosis Treatment, Illness Management and Recovery, and Supported Employment) in state public mental health systems in the United States since 2001. To date, Project findings have yielded valuable insights into implementation strategy characteristics and effectiveness. This paper reports results of an effort to identify and classify state-level implementation activities and strategies employed across the eight states participating in the Project.
   Methods: Content analysis and Greenhalgh et al's (2004) definition of innovation were used to identify and classify state-level activities employed during three phases of EBP implementation: Pre-Implementation, Initial Implementation and Sustainability Planning. Activities were coded from site visit reports created from documents and notes from key informant interviews conducted during two periods, Fall 2002 - Spring 2003, and Spring 2004. Frequency counts and rank-order analyses were used to examine patterns of implementation activities and strategies employed across the three phases of implementation.
   Results: One hundred and six discreet implementation activities and strategies were identified as innovative and were classified into five categories: 1) state infrastructure building and commitment, 2) stakeholder relationship building and communications, 3) financing, 4) continuous quality management, and 5) service delivery practices and training. Implementation activities from different categories were employed at different phases of implementation.
   Conclusion: Insights into effective strategies for implementing EBPs in mental health and other health sectors require qualitative and quantitative research that seeks to: a) empirically test the effects of tools and methods used to implement EBPs, and b) establish a stronger evidence-base from which to plan, implement and sustain such efforts. This paper offers a classification scheme and list of innovative implementation activities and strategies. The classification scheme offers potential value for future studies that seek to assess the effects of various implementation processes, and helps establish widely accepted standards and criteria that can be used to assess the value of innovative activities and strategies.

TI Adoption and sustainability of decision support for patients facing
   health decisions: an implementation case study in nursing
SO IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB Background: Effective interventions prepare patients for making values-sensitive health decisions by helping them become informed and clarifying their values for each of the options. However, patient decision support interventions have not been widely implemented and little is known about effective models for delivering them to patients. The purpose of this study was to describe call centre nurses' adoption of a decision support protocol into practice following exposure to an implementation intervention and to identify factors influencing sustainable nursing practice changes.
   Methods: Exploratory case study at a Canadian province-wide call centre guided by the Ottawa Model of Research Use. Data sources included a survey of nurses who participated in an implementation intervention (n = 31), 2 focus groups with nurses, interviews with 4 administrators, and a document review.
   Results: Twenty-five of 31 nurses responded to the survey measuring adoption of decision support in practice. Of the 25 nurses, 11 had used the decision support protocol in their practice within one month of the intervention. Twenty-two of the 25 intended to use it within the next three months. Although some nurses found it challenging to begin using the protocol, most nurses reported that it: a) helped them recognize callers needing decision support; b) changed their approach to handling these calls; and c) was a positive enhancement to their practice. Strategies identified to promote sustainability of practice changes included integration of the decision support protocol in the call centre database, streamlining the patient decision aids for easier use via telephone, clarifying the administrative direction for the call centre's program, creating a call length guideline specific for these calls, incorporating decision support training in the staff development plan, and informing the public of this enhanced service.
   Conclusion: Although most nurses adopted the decision support protocol for coaching callers facing values-sensitive decisions, to sustain practice changes, interventions are required to manage barriers in the practice environment and integrate decision support into the organization's policies, resources, and routine activities.

DE total approach; SMEs; sustainable improvement
AB Attention and assistance to enhance the role of small and medium scale enterprises (SMEs) by the government is more emphasized due to the success of SMEs in earning significant amount of foreign currency when Indonesia had to face economical crisis in 1997. This policy has been highly recognized again since the bombing tragedy in 2002; with the excellent evidence to show how important SMEs is in helping and maintaining the economic development of Bali. But in the implementation the assistance needs to be remanaged again in a more proper and appropriate way to attain the ultimate goals. The three economic potentials, agriculture in broad sense, tourism and SMEs (cottage industry included), must be developed in harmony, interdependence, support and complementary each other, if possible as synergist to obtain sustainable development of Bali. While assistance to SMEs must be done in a more coordinated way among the government technical offices, universities, NGOs, banking, and other social community institutions. By doing so, there would be no duplication or gap, nor creation of new disadvantageous problems. It could be in form of ergonomics, occupational health and safety impacts and problems in particular, and in adverse working conditions and environment in general. Therefore it is a must at this moment to carry out total approach in helping SMEs, by integrating the effort to improve their working conditions and environment, built-in within the effort to enhance SMEs'quality of life through economic assistance. In this process a total approach through SHIP approach and Appropriate Technology intervention must be done wisely and timely. By so doing, SMEs'sustainable working conditions and environment shall be attained.

AB Serial participatory action programs for reducing occupational safety and health risks were undertaken to know the types of support suited for small-scale industries. Working groups were formed with workplace people and occupational safety and health experts. It was agreed to develop an action-oriented strategy focusing on improving both work environment and productivity by making low-cost improvements;. through group work. Many workplace improvements achieved by participating enterprises and the group work procedures taken were analyzed. As supporting tools for effectively implementing the workplace improvement action programs, we developed action checklists according to industry and workplace implementation guides. Collections of local good examples also served as part of these support tools. These experiences show that keys to the sustainable action in small-scale industries are: (1) mobilization of the industry-wise network by trade associations, (2) in output-oriented strategy based on interactive group work and (3) the effective use of support tools such as low-cost action checklists and group work methods.

AB Purpose - This paper seeks to propose the examination of the importance of firms' intention to e-collaborate in facilitating e-collaboration for an informal alliance.
   Design/methodology/approach - A rigorous review of the existing literature is undertaken for the purpose of developing a contingency framework that determines firm boundaries.
   Findings - The conceptual framework posits that three decision contexts (the threat of opportunism, the threat of commercial failure, and the opportunity for sustainable advantage) are predictors of selecting the governance mode between e-collaboration and arm's-length relationship, and that an intention to e-collaborate moderates the governance mode choice.
   Originality/value - Testable propositions are offered to examine the proposed relationships in the framework. The paper concludes by suggesting that firms which would like to implement e-collaboration in a group of companies must initiate and strengthen their intention to form the desired governance mode.

AB Purpose - This paper seeks to present the results of an investigation on the justification of investments in advanced manufacturing technology (AMT) at manufacturing plants in the USA. Unlike previous research that explored the adoption and use of a specific AMT or groups of similar AMT, this study focuses on a plant's combination of technologies or its technology portfolio.
   Design/methodology/approach - Mail survey responses from a sample of 82 plants are used to examine the relationships between the type of technology portfolio being used and the justification approaches and evaluation techniques that were utilized to justify these investments. The study also investigates the level of functional integration and the level of effort applied to several activities during the justification stage of the AMT projects.
   Findings - The majority of plants that had adopted the more complex technology portfolios were using hybrid (economic and strategic) justification approaches supported by ratio and discounted cash flow justification techniques. Plants that were using the less complex portfolio also used hybrid approaches, but tended to concentrate on the use of ratio techniques. Findings on the level of functional integration at various stages of the AMT project are also reported.
   Research limitations/implications - This research concentrated on discrete-parts durable goods producers in the USA. Further studies are needed to determine whether the findings can be generalized across other industries or in other countries.
   Originahty/value - This research uses an innovative portfolio analysis approach to investigate the important topic of justification of AMT. Managerial implications arising from the results of this study and a number of new research avenues are advanced.

ID PERFORMANCE
AB Purpose - To examine whether there are differences with respect to internal auditors' attitude toward environmental protection, cognizance of environmental auditing and environmental knowledge.
   Design/methodology/approach - A questionnaire survey based research method is used and a Mann-Whitney U-test as well as a T-test is applied on this data.
   Findings - There is no difference between internal auditors in the manufacturing industry and those in the service industry with respect to environmental awareness and cognizance of environmental auditing. Yet there is a significant difference with respect to knowledge of environmental protection.
   Research limitations/implications - This study is limited to that of internal auditors' perspectives. Practical implications - Internal auditors are the "watch dogs" for firms to implement environmental management so that strengthening their enviromnental knowledge is required.
   Originality/value - This study reveals internal auditors' perception toward environmental management in both high- and low-pollution industries that go beyond green auditing issues.

ID KNOWLEDGE
AB Purpose - To formulate a vision of the mechanism of generating social capital at a firm level and its influence on sustainable behavior, testing the assumption of social capital as a feedback to support the firm's sustainable behavior.
   Design/methodology/approach - The collection of primary data is based on a structured questionnaire. The information is collected by means of interviewing Bulgarian citizens and businessmen. The questions are divided according to: interrelations within the team, attitude to social problems and sustainable behavior of the firm, and socio-economic profile. Non-parametric methods are used to study the relationships among the basic indicators.
   Findings - It is necessary to present the attitudes of the respondents to problems related to the basic hypothesis formulated in the paper, provide additional proofs of the feedback assumption of social capital, formulate the preconditions for generating social capital and its contribution in realizing sustainable behavior of the firm.
   Research limitations/implications - Further extension is warranted to cover more sectors and countries of the region. Practical implications - It gives an idea to distinguish between the formal and informal structures of the firm, enhance endeavors to increase attention to social factors in the decision-making process at top level, formulate the concept of feedback role of social capital, and how it can be used to reach sustainability in a firm's behavior.
   Originality/value - This study provides additional proofs of the role of social capital as a feedback to support sustainable behavior of the firms and extend the vision of firms' management in distinguishing between formal and informal structures.

SO INDUSTRIAL MANAGEMENT & DATA SYSTEMS

ID PERFORMANCE
AB Purpose - To address two key problems facing the production department at the government pharmaceutical organization (GPO). They were a lack of productivity and performance measurement at the operational level, and a need to assess the functional readiness to undertake its own performance-analysis work.
   Design/methodology/approach - The decision was made to apply the multi-factor productivity measurement model (MFPNM). This was due to its ability to link with existing data that had been generated by the accounting department, its explicit integration between productivity and financial performance (i.e. profitability) at the operational level, and its major features such as information on opportunity gain/loss.
   Findings - For the GPO, it was quite clear that productivity improvement would represent the critical direction for the production department in the future. Based on its initial deployment at the Section 3 unit, the MFPMM was generally viewed as a suitable tool for measuring and providing necessary productivity/performance information.
   Practical implications - The database management needed to be improved in order to ensure timely provision of data into the MFPMM. Furthermore, better performance-analysis capability by the staffs was required. In other words, both technical and managerial aspects must be recognized in order to ensure the MFPMM success and sustainability.
   Originality/value - This study generated insightful information into operational performance at the GPC. It was clear that productivity represented the basis for formulating future policy initiatives.

AB In more and more industries it becomes true that value creating networks compete against each other with relatively stable relations between suppliers inside the network. Managers all over the world are searching for the most efficient and effective coordinative forms for their relations with OEM's or suppliers within such a value-creating networks. This paper gives a normative guideline to decide if or if not a partnership is the right coordinative form for OEM-supplier relations within a value-creating network. Based on the existing mainly positivistic research in this field, two aspects are highlighted as the main drivers for the suitability of a partnership as a well working governance mechanism for value-creating networks: (i) individualization vs. standardization of the delivered components combined with the potential of the end customers to identify quality differences or not and (ii) the possibilities to allocate the revenues made by the value-creating network on the several 'partners' within the network. All aspects were integrated in a decision model for managers to find out if partnership as the coordinative form is really the best choice in a given situation. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

AB We find that the presence of village Internet facilities, offering government to citizen services, is positively associated with the rate at which the villagers obtain some of these services. In a study of a rural Internet project in India, we identify a positive correlation for two such Internet services: obtaining birth certificates for children and applications for old age pensions. Both these government services are of considerable social and economic value to the citizens. Villagers report that the Internet based services saved them time, money, and effort compared with obtaining the services directly from the government office. We also find that these services can reduce corruption in the delivery of these services. After over one year of successful operation, however, the e-government program was not able to maintain the necessary level of local political and administrative support to remain institutionally viable. As government officers shifted from the region, or grew to find the program a threat, the e-government services faltered. We argue that this failure was due to a variety of Critical Failure Factors. We end with a simple sustainability failure model. In summary, we propose that the e-government program failed to be politically and institutionally sustainable due to people, management, cultural, and structural factors.

AB This article presents a watershed management methodology based on a land-use planning model whereby sustainability criteria are introduced according to the capacity of the environment to support interventions in the watershed. The model has been applied to the middle course of the Jarama river (Guadalajara, Spain), taking into account the likely construction of a storage dam for controlling the flow of the Tajo river into which the Jarama river flows. In this study a distribution of activities has been carried out according to the established goals in the management plan. The results show a greater degree of detail if compared to the ones obtained with the models traditionally applied in watershed management.

AB The ecological footprint is studied as a macroindicator of sustainability applicable to companies and corporations. Until now, this macroindicator has been applied to cities, regions, or countries. It accounts for the consumption of natural resources by converting them into hectares of "nature" or consumed productive land. The parameters analyzed in this research have been consumption of energy, fuel, material, paper, wood, water, built land, and green areas, and residues generated by the Gijon Port Authority, Spain. The results show a net ecological footprint of 3,279.84 ha. The main components of the footprint are construction works (nearly 2,000 ha) and electricity consumption (679 ha). Studies of this kind enable companies to design sustainable development plans to reduce consumption as well as develop "green" (footprint-free) products and create "natural capital" (wastage absorption). Until now, these issues have not been on the agenda of companies, but they are indispensable in achieving real sustainability.

AB GENE ARCH is an evolution-based Generative Design System that uses adaptation to shape energy-efficient and sustainable architectural solutions. The system applies goal-oriented design, combining a Genetic Algorithm (GA) as the search engine, with DOE2.1E building simulation software as the evaluation module. The GA can work either as a standard GA or as a Pareto GA, for multicriteria optimization. In order to provide a full view of the capacities of the software, different applications are discussed: 1) Standard GA: testing of the software; 2) Standard GA: incorporation of architecture design intentions, using a building by architect Alvaro Siza; 3) Pareto GA: choice of construction materials, considering cost, building energy use, and embodied energy; 4) Pareto GA: application to Siza's building; 5) Standard GA: Shape generation with single objective function; 6) Pareto GA: shape generation with multicriteria; 7) Pareto GA: application to an urban and housing context. Overall conclusions from the different applications are discussed.

AB The greatest opportunity for sustainable building design strategies occur in the early stages of design when the most important decisions are taken. Nevertheless, it is the stage with the least computer support. This paper presents recent research efforts at ETS toward the long term goal of developing the next generation of computer assistance to designers of sustainable buildings. Two research thrusts are presented: (1) to provide assistance to designers earlier in the design process, and (2) to provide better means to support collaboration among the various stakeholders. Two research projects are briefly presented that belong to the first thrust: an approach that allows structural engineers to propose feasible structural systems earlier directly from architectural sketches; and another that provides a means to optimize aspects of a building selected by the designer. A new laboratory is presented that will provide the infrastructure to carry out research in the second thrust.

AB We present an overview of events and on-going discussions in the International academic community with respect to free and open knowledge. We argue againts the alleged rights of the publishing houses to prevent the preservation and distribution of academic knowledge by the institutions that produce it. As a example of an alternative and sustainable innitiative to preserve and distribute academic creations, we present a web-enable Institutional Re-pository at www. saber ula. ve < http://www. saber ula.vel >. We do so, by explaining our experiences and trying to draw a few methological recommendations for capturing, managing and distributing knowledge produce by a University, based in a effort that has last already five years. To this effect, some statistical evidence of that operation is also shown.

TI From 'quantity' to 'quality' - Restructuring South Africa's housing
   policy ten years after
SO INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT PLANNING REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
ID SUBSIDY
AB Ten years after the South African Department of Housing (DoH) released its 1994 White Paper which set out a new national housing vision, policy, and strategy, the cabinet approved a new document entitled 'Breaking New Ground: a Comprehensive Plan for the Development of Sustainable Human Settlements', which sets out the government's approach to housing delivery for the next five years. The DoH has stated that the new document should not be viewed as a fundamental change from the 1994 policy, but rather as an 'enhancement'. A thorough reading of the document, however, reveals that it does introduce some fundamental changes, among them shifting from 'quantity' to 'quality' and therefore from 'breadth' to 'depth' in low-cost housing delivery; shifting the housing process from 'supply-driven' to 'demand-driven'; promoting in situ upgrading of informal settlements over the former greenfield developments; and acknowledging the need for the government to assume part of the risk involved in private sector lending to low-income households.

TI Tourism planning and regional instability
SO INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT PLANNING REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
ID AFRICA
AB Tourism is likely to be a significant source of growth for many developing countries during the coming decades. However, the globalisation of the tourist sector is likely to pose increasing challenges to development planners concerned with ensuring equitable and sustainable local development initiatives. This paper examines the rapid growth of tourism in Jordan in the wake of the peace treaty with Israel and a series of projections of the growth potential of the sector based on overly optimistic predictions of future tourist visits and the resulting revenue produced by the World Tourism Organisation. Continuing instability in the region has caused very large fluctuations in revenues and had severe consequences for smaller tourism operators. This paper will assess the consequences of this instability, with special attention to the pattern of investments in Petra and Wadi Musa, and provide lessons learned for other countries seeking to stabilise tourism and investments.

TI The advantages of a rooftop garden and other things
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ART & DESIGN EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
AB Design education is an aesthetic and humanistic approach for teaching how to contribute to the improvement of the conditions that affect everyone's lives. This article offers an overview of some important concepts to teach young people about regeneration design and the future of our changing environment. It is becoming increasingly evident that we are immersed in vital ecological relationships and with that awareness comes the undertaking of responsibly sharing the planet with non-human life, of the need to live within environmental limits, and of ways to create communities that enhance life. There is movement toward a transition from a society preoccupied with consumerism and exploitation, to one that gives priority to a more sustainable future. Underscoring the importance of this issue are three regeneration principles adhered to by many city planners, architects, and product designers: smart growth, sustainable development, and new urbanism. Each has a slightly different set of theories and practices but all have a common thread in restructuring efforts for cities and buildings to be aesthetically, economically, and ecologically healthier places for human and non-human life. Students should be taught that life-enhancing design embraces inclusiveness, is built to human scale, is eco-effective, is aesthetically enriching, and is embedded in social responsibility.

TI LTV models in MPC for sustainable development
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONTROL
LA English
DT Article
AB Recent work has formulated an MPC strategy for a sustainable development problem, focused on the control of a stochastic, non-linear, economic model called PROMETHEUS. This work also takes PROMETHEUS to be the system. To use MPC an analytic approximation of PROMETHEUS is required, with previous work focusing on linear and non-linear time invariant models. Global optimality of the solution could not be guaranteed, since to achieve reasonable accuracy in iterative fitting was required which destroyed convexity of the optimization. In this paper an LTV model is considered and is shown to reduce the approximation error. It is demonstrated that the model can be finitely parameterized and that the predominant time variation in PROMETHEUS is from a decaying exponential weighting on the predicted input sequence. It is suggested that this variation is a representation of inflation. The sustainable development MPC methodology is recast for such a model. Convexity of the MPC optimization with an LTV model guarantees global optimality; results are presented which demonstrate the improvement in performance which this allows.

AB The education of agricultural machinery technicians is performed by the vocational schools in Turkey. One of the main problems of the agricultural sector in Turkey is the lack of qualified technicians. Parallel to the changing agricultural engineering concept in Europe, new technologies have been launched for leaching of agricultural machinery technicians. New and expanded areas like GPS and GPRS for management, technical-biological system analysis, and natural Resources Technology have been included in the agricultural technologies disciplines of traditional Universities of Agricultural Colleges in the EU. Modern agricultural machinery technician courses include the subjects of information technologies, mechatronics, sensor technology and robotics. The most important step to take in Agricultural machinery programs is to increase the quality of agricultural education and to identify where it stands in international standards. Throughout the membership application process of Turkey prior to joining the EC there has been a need for the application of new technologies and more qualified, sustainable education for agricultural machinery technicians who will be welcomed by the EU countries. In this paper, we describe the model and curriculum of agricultural machinery technician education of the Uludag University.

AB Many countries have the problem of a severe water imbalance. This imbalance in water demand vs. supply is due mainly to the relatively uneven distribution of precipitation, high temperatures, increased demands for irrigation water and the impacts of tourism. To alleviate water shortages serious consideration must be given to wastewater reclamation and reuse. In this paper, some good examples of the potential benefits of wastewater reuse in different countries are presented, giving special consideration to the costs associated with the processes. Naturally, they are most obvious for the and areas but the general increasing pressures on water resources all over the world should also make wastewater reuse attractive in other areas. The criterion for selecting these cases has been the contribution of the system into the overall increase of wastewater reuse in the country implemented. The effect of potential success factors and parameters has been looked into in order to realise why the implementation of these systems was proven to be highly efficient and successful.

AB The continued population growth, the contamination of both surface water and groundwater, the uneven distribution of water resources and the periodic droughts have forced the water agencies to search for new sources of water supply. Use of highly treated wastewater effluents, now discharged to the environment from municipal wastewater treatment plants, is receiving more attention as a reliable water resource. In many countries, water reuse is already an important element in water resources planning and implementation. Nevertheless, the sustainable wastewater treatment and reuse is a continuous challenge. Following, an overview is made for some of the Mediterranean countries in regards to water resources, wastewater treatment and reuse, the aim being to determine the problems associated with them and to reveal ways to promote wastewater reuse for irrigation purposes.

AB The analysis of the sustainability of public sector finances requires an accounting of all future revenues and all future spending that we would expect, under current tax laws and current entitlements. The classical calculation does not acknowledge the inherent uncertainty of the future economic and demographic developments, so the results can be misleading. Our aim is to produce a more robust summary of the sustainability of the public sector than the one currently available. By taking a forecasting point,of view, our formulation takes into account the uncertainty of future productivity, stock and bond markets, and demography. Methodological complications that arise in the stochastic setting are discussed. Estimates of the relative roles of economics and demographics in the uncertainty of public net liabilities are presented. (c) 2005 International Institute of Forecasters. Published by Elsevier B.V.

ID FUEL-CELL; SIMULATION; SYSTEM
AB This paper describes a dynamic model for PEM electrolyzer based on conservation of mole balance at the anode and the cathode. A further feature of the model is it includes water phenomena, electro-osmotic drag and diffusion, through the membrane. The model considers PEM electrolyzer to be composed of four ancillaries: anode, cathode, membrane and voltage ancillary. Additionally, hydrogen storage dynamics is presented. The developed model is suitable for determining control strategy that will ensure efficient and reliable operation of the electrolyzer. Moreover, the dynamic model can be integrated with renewable energy systems models to design, analyze and optimize sustainable energy systems. The study illustrates the dynamic interactions within a PEM electrolyzer and shows the necessity of the proposed approach of separate ancillaries.

ID PORTLAND-CEMENT INDUSTRY; DEMAND; COMPETITION; PRICE; BEHAVIOR
AB This paper investigates the effect of capacity constraints on the sustainability of collusion in markets subject to cyclical demand fluctuations. In the absence of capacity constraints, Haltiwanger and Harrington (1991) [Haltiwanger, J., Harrington, J., 1991. The impact of cyclical demand movements on collusive behavior. Rand Journal of Economics. 22, 89-106.] show that firms find it more difficult to collude during periods of decreasing demand. We find that this prediction can be overturned if firms' capacities are sufficiently small. Capacity constraints imply that punishment profits move procyclically, so that periods of increasing demand may lead to lower losses from cheating even if collusive profits are rising. Haltiwanger and Harrington's main prediction remains valid for sufficiently large capacities. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: This study represents a comprehensive assessment of differences between participants in an HIV/AIDS prevention program (SHAPE: Sustainability, Hope, Action, Prevention, Education) and non-participants in knowledge, attitudes and practices with a focus on cultural, sociological and economic variables.
   Methods: We developed an eight-page questionnaire that was administered to 933 randomly selected students at the University of Zimbabwe. Survey items addressed sexual decision-making, condom use, limiting sexual partners, cultural power dynamics and access to HIV testing.
   Results: Results show participants are statistically more likely to report being sexually abstinent, and understand the prevention benefits of condom use. SHAPE members had fewer sexual partners in the previous year than non-SHAPE members (1.4 vs. 2.2). SHAPE members were significantly more likely (67%) than non-SHAPE respondents (48%) to indicate that they knew their HIV sero-status and to state that they knew their status because they had been tested (85% vs. 71%).
   Discussion: Though we found differences between the groups suggesting that program participation increases awareness concerning gender equity, there continue to be many intractable cultural attitudes in this age group. Findings suggest that the attitudes and practices of young men and women are changing, but that progress in some areas does not assure progress in all areas.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT

DT Article
DE Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA); Life Cycle Management (LCM);
   process industry; Resource Impact Indicator (RII); Social Impact
   Indicator (SII); social sustainability
AB Goal, Scope and Background. The importance of the social dimension of sustainable development increased significantly during the last decade of the twentieth century. Industry has subsequently experienced a shift in stakeholder pressures from environmental to social-related concerns, where new developments in the form of projects and technologies are undertaken. However, the measurement of social impacts and the calculation of suitable indicators are less well developed compared to environmental indicators in order to assess the potential liabilities associated with undertaken projects and technologies. The aim of this paper is to propose a Social Impact Indicator (SII) calculation procedure based on a previously introduced Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) calculation procedure for environmental Resource Impact Indicators (RIIs), and to demonstrate the practicability of the SII procedure in the context of the process industry in South Africa.
   Methods. A framework of social sustainability criteria has been introduced for the South African process industry. The social sub-criteria of the framework are further analyzed, based on project and technology management expertise in the South African process industry, to determine whether the criteria should be addressed at project or technology management level or whether they should rather form part of an overall corporate governance policy for new projects and technologies. Furthermore, the proposed indicators for criteria that are considered appropriate for project or technology evaluation purposes are constrained by the type of information that is available, i.e. the calculation methodology relies on the availability of regional or national social information where the project will be implemented, as well as the availability of project- or technology-specific social information during the various phases of the project or technology development life cycle. Case studies in the process industry and statistical information for South Africa are subsequently used to establish information availability for the SII calculation procedure, demonstrate the SII method together with the RII method, and determine the practical use of the SII method.
   Results and Conclusion. The case studies establish that social footprint information as well as project- and technology social data are not readily available in the South African process industry. Consequently, the number of mid-point categories that can be evaluated are minimal, which results in an impaired social picture when compared to the environmental dimension. It is concluded that a quantitative social impact assessment method cannot be applied for project and technology life cycle management purposes in industry at present.
   Recommendation and Perspective. Following the outcomes of the case studies in the South African process industry, it is recommended that checklists and guidelines be used during project and technology life cycle management practices. Similar to the environmental dimension, it is envisaged that such checklists and guidelines would improve the availability of quantitative data in time, and would therefore make the SII procedure more practical in the future.

TI Environmental profile of Brazilian green coffee
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE agricultural products; Brazil; green coffee; life cycle inventory (LCI);
   sustainability
AB Goal, Scope and Background. Brazil is the world's biggest producer of coffee beans with approx. a 30% market share. Depending on climate conditions, approx. 30 million bags of coffee beans are exported annually from Brazil, while domestic consumption is around 10 million bags, which makes Brazil the world's third largest coffee-consuming country. Therefore, the goal of this paper is to present the LCA of green coffee produced in Brazil for the reference crops 2001/02 and 2002/03 in order to generate detailed production inventory data as well as to identify the potential environmental impacts of its tillage in order to realize how to reduce those impacts and increase the environmental sustainability of this product. Only the inputs and outputs relative to the coffee tillage were considered. The production of fertilizers, correctives and pesticides were not included in the boundary, but only their amounts. The functional unit selected for this study was 1,000 kg of green coffee destined for exportation.
   Methods. The LCI was performed according to the ISO 14040 standard series. All information considered in this study (use of water, fossil based energy, fertilizers and chemicals) were taken up in in-depth data collection and evaluation by questionnaires applied on a farm level and/or received by mail. Four Brazilian coffee producer regions were evaluated: Cerrado Mineiro, South of Minas Gerais State, the Marilia and Alta Mogiana regions in Sao Paulo State. These regions have the following geographic coordinates: 44 to 50 degrees W longitude and 18 to 24 degrees S latitude. The data refer to a production of 420,000 coffee bean bags and a productive area of approx. 14,300 ha. The varieties of coffee beans considered in this study were Mundo Novo, Catuai (yellow and red), Icatu (yellow and red), Catucai (yellow and red) and Obata. Farm specific data along with agricultural production data have been combined to elaborate a coffee cultivation inventory, which will be applied in an emissions estimation.
   Results and Conclusion. The production of 1,000 kg of green coffee in Brazil requires approx. 11,400 kg of water, 94 kg of diesel, 270 kg of fertilizers as NPK, 900 kg of total fertilizers, 620 kg of correctives, 10 kg of pesticides and 0.05 hectare of annual land use. Outputs related to these functional units are approx. 3,000 kg of waste water from coffee washing, 8,500 kg of waste water from the wet method and 750 kg of organic residue that is reincorporated to the tillage as fertilizer. The publication of an LCI of agricultural products is a fundamental step for understanding the potential environmental impacts of each tillage and then establishes the basis for product sustainability. In this way, this work is the first Brazilian initiative for applying LCA to coffee cultivation.
   Recommendation and Perspective. Different agricultural practices demonstrate different environmental profiles. The amount of agricultural pesticide is directly related to agricultural practices as tillage rotation, density of plants, etc. This study supplied important results for a better correlation of the agricultural practices and potential environmental impacts of coffee. Future updates of this study will show the evolution of the natural resource management such as land use, new agricultural practices, lower fertilizers and chemicals use.

TI Benchmarking the environmental performances of farms
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT

DE benchmarking; certification; environmental performance of farms;
   labelling
ID INDICATORS; MANAGEMENT
AB Background, Aim and Scope. The usual route for improvement of agricultural practice towards sustainability runs via labelling schemes for products or farm practices. In most approaches requirements are set in absolute terms, disregarding the variation in environmental performance of farms. Another approach for promoting sustainable farming concerns the concept of benchmarking, which takes into account competition among farmers. The individual agricultural performance is characterized by quantitative criteria and compared with scores of other relevant farms.
   Methods. Therefore, a pilot study has been conducted in the Netherlands concerning benchmarking among arable farmers in the Internet involving crop protection. A voluntary Dutch benchmark initiative in the Internet is described including farmers' perception regarding the tool.
   Results. The results show that the benchmark tool in the Internet allows farmers to compare their environmental and economic performance anonymously and securely in a large-scale open-access environment. The pilot group of farmers responded positively to the instrument. An important factor in success is the ease and speed with which data can be entered into the benchmark tool.
   Conclusions. A benchmark tool for comparing the environmental performance among farmers can form the basis for agreements between farmers and their costumers. An application involving food industry and retailers is discussed.

DE aluminium; emissions and energy intensity; global resource flows; life
   cycle management; natural resources; recycling; sustainable management
AB Goal, Scope and Background. This case study describes the development and utilization of a global, quantitative model of current and projected aluminium and life cycle inventory mass flows. The model and key results were developed to be shared with global aluminium industry technical experts, executives, and external stakeholders to better understand potential paths to more global sustainable aluminium.
   Methods. The model is based on annual statistical data since 1950 provided by government agencies and regional aluminum associations and on the most recent life cycle inventory intensity data (year 2002) complied for the global industry by the International Aluminium Institute. Modeling of future aluminium and resource flows are based on literature and industry expert projections of future product shipment demand. The availability of recycle flows to meet these market demands are based on projected utilization, yield, and melt loss recovery rates, post-consumer recycling rates, and anticipated future product lifetimes. The model was developed with quantitative 'what-if' capability to determine the positive impact of enhanced recycling, lower resource intense production, and product usage scenarios.
   Results and Conclusion. The model provides the first quantitative assessment of annual global aluminium and life cycle inventory flows. Results include a quantitative estimate by major market of global aluminium product inventory, system losses, recycle rates, and selected resource requirements and air emissions implications.
   Recommendation and Perspective. Model results and scenarios have been reviewed and shared with global aluminium technical leaders, executives and key external stakeholders in support of the International Aluminum Institute's new voluntary global objective to better monitor and enhance aluminium recycling and sustainable development initiative.

AB The World Health Organisation's (WHO) Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion in 1986 provided the catalyst from which the Health Promoting Prison (HPP) movement emerged. Here, an extensive review of the available prison-related health literature provides the basis for critical discussion and recommendations for nursing services and prison-related health care. The findings suggest that current prison-based nursing services are seriously neglected and woefully lacking in structure and resources. This article recommends strategies for reform that includes nurses who practice in all settings, and not just prison-based nurses. If nurses wish to be at the forefront of future HPP strategies, they must first embrace the radical health promotion reforms that are emerging from the current literature. Building sustainable group capacity into prison-based health care, through developing social interaction, cohesion, participation and political action can only benefit the community at large and further emphasise the health promotion role of nursing.

TI Extending green practices across the supply chain - The impact of

AB Purpose - This research aims to extend the "collaborative paradigm" proposed by others in prior research beyond a supply chain's core operations. To date, this paradigm has generated relatively little empirical research on peripheral, non-core areas such the natural environment. Antecedents (both plant-level and supply chain characteristics) of green supply chain practices (GSCP) are examined. Among possible antecedents, prior research pointed to supply chain integration - both logistical (tactical level) and technological (strategic level) - as a potentially important determinant of green practices.
   Design/methodology/approach - Green practices are defined along the two dimensions of environmental collaboration and monitoring. The empirical analysis used data from 84 plants in North America surveyed in 2002. Validity and reliability of scales for new and existing constructs were assessed through factor analysis. Hierarchical linear regression was used to test the hypotheses for the antecedents of GSCP.
   Findings - Technological integration with primary suppliers and major customers was positively linked to environmental monitoring and collaboration. For logistical integration, a linkage was found only with environmental monitoring of suppliers. Finally, as the supply base was reduced, the extent of environmental collaboration with primary suppliers increased.
   Research limitations/implications - Greater supply chain integration can benefit environment management in operations, and the collaborative paradigm can be extended to this domain. A limitation is that the empirical analysis focused on one industry representing a single echelon.
   Originality/value - This is one of the few studies that conceptualize and empirically test GSCP, and consider both and separately upstream and downstream interactions in the supply chain.

AB This article explores the possibility of taking into account environmental constraints in scheduling solutions for a "cleaner" treatment surface. In such an industry, the key point to control is related to the handling of products from one bath to another (or tank) by hoists. Mathematical models (known as hoist scheduling problems) involved in the hoist scheduling maximize the shop throughput (maximum productivity) assuming implicitly that the environmental cost and impact of each treatment are constant as long as each soaking durations (processing time) stay in a time window [min value; max value]. When taking into account all cost parameters, a nonlinear global cost function can be created. Then, the schedule can be improved from the environmental point of view by using a nonlinear optimization.
   Finally, the well-known triangle quality-cost-delay is improved considering a new dimension and becomes a tetrahedron quality-cost-delay-environment. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Enterprises in today's business environment conduct transactions beyond the traditional boundaries of their physical locations. Many organizations offer services and/or finished products through a combination of delivery methods. Some of these delivery methods involve the Internet, the sales staff on the physical site and/or on the calling centers (own or outsourced). Organizations with such parallel delivery methods face great complexity in business structure and in the dynamics among different business functions. Such organizations are designated as Scalable Enterprise Systems (SES). The complexity of SESs means additional business challenges to stay competitive and maintain sustainable profitability. The main objective of this paper is the identification of a reference framework for quality management (QM) and business process reengineering (BPR) with the ability to constantly learn and the flexibility to adjust to concurrent changes of the SES and the environment. Key elements from QM and BPR are examined and selected, compared and extrapolated to SES. An example is provided to illustrate the relevance of QM and BPR in SES. Future research for SES as it relates to the adaptation of QM and BPR is highlighted. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The current mandates for depression screening in primary care create a dilemma for clinicians. How should screening be implemented in the face of limited evidence for sustainable strategies for effective depression monitoring and management in primary care. In this article we review the issues surrounding primary care depression screening, and develop the argument for a case-finding strategy that includes careful choice of a single instrument, focused identification of high-risk patients, and systematic monitoring of outcomes. We believe this is a sustainable method that primary care clinicians can implement to address the spirit of current depression screening mandates.

TI Hotel networks and social capital in destination marketing
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SERVICE INDUSTRY MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE horizontal management; social accounting; marketing; case studies
AB Purpose - The paper provides insights into destination marketing and the conditions and outcome of competitor co-operation in a local, horizontal hotel network. The specific purpose is to uncover the mechanics of such a network and offer a theory together with recommendations for practice and future research.
   Design/methodology/approach - In contrast with manufactured goods, which are distributed to the market, destination marketing distributes customers to a service production site. This basic prerequisite has effects on marketing strategies and the networking of competitors, and so has the fact that the services are in part delivered in interaction with customers and between customers at a physical place. The paper is based on inductive case study research, and the observations and conclusions from the empirical case data are given precedence over extant theory. The case, the Hotel Group, is a hotel network in the town of Ostersund, Sweden. The case is directed towards certain strategic business-to-business elements of destination marketing.
   Findings - The study shows that the Hotel Group has found a success formula. Among the results are that a drive for action, both planned and improvised, is more decisive for success than plans and expressed intentions; that networking is facilitated when local competitors build social capital through trust and commitment in action; and that competitors have to adhere to certain basic principles, strike a balance between seemingly contradictory strategies, and live by an agreed code of conduct.
   Research limitations/implications - The case study lays bare the need to rethink certain mainstream vantage points used in research. These include departure from the notion of small- and medium-sized businesses as autonomous economic entities and consider them part of networks; recognition of the social context and synergy of a network organization and its code of conduct; and learning to manage a social network by balancing seeming paradoxes and opposites. The study is temporally limited and does not forecast the sustainability and robustness of the network and its success formula over time and under changing conditions.
   Practical implications - The study offers normative and actionable insights about the success of a horizontal tourism network. The network members should adhere to three basic principles: show enthusiasm, give time, and contribute to financing; they have to perform balancing acts between the collective and individual, co-operation and competition, and planning/intention and action; and they have to follow a seven-point code of conduct.
   Originality/value - The paper contributes to a theory of co-operation in marketing networks. It empirically examines network mechanics when local competitors take action to improve their individual situation by improving the collective competitive position on the market, provides insights into destination marketing and the conditions and outcome of competitor co-operation in a local, horizontal hotel network.

AB The distinctive Shell approach to innovation derives from how the innovation process is managed and executed. The management approach is a combination of robust business process, with clear objectives and decision points, and a light-touch style of management that recognises the emotive aspects of innovation such as creativity drive and change. An important aspect is the integration of sustainable development in the innovation effort. Sustainable innovation incorporates the values of society as a third driver in addition to customer needs and technological options. Successful innovation management requires a transparent and effective innovation business process based on a sound understanding of the nature and characteristics of the innovation process. Innovation is a quest for bringing an idea to market, while managing innovation is about creating value during that process by involving the stakeholders, identifying and reducing the risks, structuring the decision-making process and improving the chances of success - knowing that ultimately the winner is unpredictable.

ID ANTIBODIES
AB The sugarcane plant, with its enormous genetic capacity to accumulate carbon and manufacture and store sucrose, also has the potential to accumulate carbon and metabolically create a wide range of new molecules for industrial and other commercial uses. The extent to which this change can be developed and realised commercially is a function of the technical competence of the industry's R&D capacity, the reality of the commercial drivers which support this global agenda, and the determination of the industry to achieve such goals. The outcomes of existing R&D work already strongly support the technical challenges of this opportunity in sugarcane. The current challenge remains the commercialisation of the technology in a global market in which the current business structures and systems for the manufacture and distribution of existing (competitive) products makes the development of new product lines a higher risk than might otherwise be the case. This is despite all the claims that global markets are expecting and (in some cases) legislating the creation of more sustainable production systems. The options and issues for the development of a sugarcane biofactory system are discussed.

DT Article
AB In the near future, the biorefinery concept of complete utilisation of sugarcane biomass will become a pivotal element for a sustainable sugarcane industry. An industry that produces liquid fuels, electricity and commodity chemicals from a renewable source in regional communities will contribute to all elements of the triple bottom line and should be considered a compelling vision. The Cooperative Research Centre for Sugar Industry Innovation through Biotechnology (CRC-SIIB) commenced in August 2003 and has embarked on a significant program of research and development to underpin sugarcane biorefining. Fermentation to ethanol and other renewable commodities and biomass treatment processes such as pulping are key technical elements of the biorefinery concept. The Sugar Research Institute (SRI) and collaborating organisations are developing key processing technologies and products, and plan to demonstrate biorefining on a pilot scale by 2006. This presentation highlights current research activities of the CRC-SIIB and SRI, and addresses the commercial opportunities, technical barriers and path to establishing sugarcane biorefining in Australia.

TI Erodibility of hill peat
SO IRISH JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
DE peat erodibility; sedimentology; sustainable farming
AB The energy necessary to entrain soil in water depends on the soil strength. Once entrained, the settling velocity of the eroded soil in water is of fundamental importance to the processes of sediment transport and deposition. In this paper, stream power theory and transport concepts coupled with the equation of continuity were used to derive a transport-limited peat concentration. The ratio of the log of the actual sediment concentration in surface run-off to the log of the transport-limited sediment concentration was the index of erosion used. The value of this index is a measure of the sensitivity of peat to erosion by sheet flow. Four peats were subjected to a range of overland flow rates under two slopes in a laboratory flume. The peats represented peat farmed in a sustainable manner (Leenane), overgrazed peat (Maam), peat undergoing erosion (Newport) and peat which had undergone weathering following exposure by a landslip (Croagh Patrick). Both in situ and surface damaged slabs were studied. The results indicate that shearing and remoulding of a wet peat surface (e.g., by animal treading) and weathering of exposed drained peat surfaces predispose peat to erosion. Defoliation by overgrazing is considered to be of secondary importance.

TI Adoption of sustainable irrigation management practices by stone and

SO IRRIGATION SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
ID STRATEGIES
AB The management of water resources by orchards in the south-eastern region of Australia is an increasingly important policy issue, especially given the low water allocations and concerns about salinity in recent years. Optimal management for economic and environmental sustainability can be described as best management practice (BMP). A project was developed to run an extension program, which aimed to achieve behavioural change among orchardists through the adoption of irrigation BMPs and benchmarks. The effectiveness of the extension program was evaluated and the drivers for adoption assessed. In the first stage of the project both BMPs and benchmarks were determined for irrigation management. A survey of 200 growers showed no relationship between yield and irrigation system or irrigation volume suggesting that increased yields were not a key driver for adoption of sustainable irrigation practices. Stage two of the project involved undertaking an extension program aimed to facilitate the adoption of BMPs and benchmarks and incorporated a suite of activities to meet the learning needs of a diversity of participants (40 growers). The program was effective in establishing behavioural change for many of the growers involved; however, it was resource intensive requiring significant one-on-one input. Stage three aimed to analyse the key drivers for adoption of sustainable irrigation practices for the whole of the stone and pome fruit industry in south-eastern Australia using market research. The study determined that water use efficiency was not a key driver for adoption of sustainable irrigation practices (micro irrigation and soil moisture monitoring) and adoption was generally not limited by lack of knowledge. Groups of growers were identified where extension programs could be effective by focussing on specific information e.g. redevelopment of orchard. Other groups had no need and/or ability to change unless the external operating environment was to change e.g. regulation, access to pressurised water. The voluntary adoption of more sustainable irrigation practices will probably require extensive resources using one-on-one methodology. The extension program should not focus on the broader social objective of improved water use efficiency but promote other potential benefits (e.g. labour saving, redevelopment of production systems, management flexibility) with targeted messages for specific groups.

AB A method to improve blast furnace efficiency and make it sustainable is to lower the temperature of the iron oxide reduction using a highly reactive coke. Understanding the role of coal rank, maceral composition and mineral matter in coke in the gasification reaction under these new conditions is of major importance. Four cokes prepared from Australian coals of varying rank, maceral composition and ash composition were gasified with carbon dioxide. The rank and maceral composition of the parent coals did not appear to be related to the reactivity of the cokes. However, coke reactivity increased with increasing total amount of catalytic minerals in crystalline phases such as metallic iron, iron sulfides. Calcium sulfide could be a potential catalyst for the gasification reaction. Iron, potassium and sodium present in the amorphous phase did not appear to have any effect on coke reactivity. Calcium was present only in the crystalline phases. Knowing the form and amount of the mineral phases that catalyse the gasification reaction in coke would improve the ability to predict coke reactivity. This knowledge would contribute to more efficiently matching cokes to blast furnace requirements.

AB This paper sets out to investigate the statistical properties of current account in the crisis-affected countries of East Asian (Asian-5: Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand) utilizing data from 1976Q1 to 2001Q4. We split the full sample period into two sub-periods of the pre-crisis (1976Q1-1996Q4) and post-crisis (1997Q1-2001Q4) eras. Univariate unit root tests indicate that current account follows a non-stationary process under both eras. However, using more sophisticated panel techniques revealed that the current account displays mean-reverting property in all three sampling periods. Meanwhile, deviations of half-life estimates in the full sample period (post-crisis) were found to be much more rapid compared to the pre-crisis period. Our major conclusions are first, the empirical evidence supports the modern intertemporal approach to current account. Second, the results reveal that the Asian-5 current accounts were on a sustainable path, even during the pre-crisis period, hence, questioning the notion that the East Asian financial crisis was due to the mismanagement of external imbalances.

AB A high-temperature water (HTW) crystallization method was applied to produce size- and form-controlled organic nanocrystals without the use of any organic solvents. HTW and room-temperature water (RTW) were used as the extraction and cooling solvents, respectively. Nanocrystals are precipitated by mixing a high-temperature quinacridone aqueous solution in a newly developed micromixing unit with RTW from another line. Quinacridone nanocrystals having ail average diameter of ca. 9 nm as determined from transmission electron microscopy observations and ca. 83 nm from dynamic light scattering measurements were produced at 250.6 degrees C and 24 MPa with a flow rate of 10 g/min for HTW and 20 g/min for RTW. In addition, it was found that nanocrystals having different crystal sizes and forms could be obtained by changing the temperature and flow rate of RTW. This new method promises ail environmentally sustainable process for the continuous production of organic nanocrystals.

AB This article reports on the first 4 years of an effort to develop comprehensive and sustainable mathematics education reforms in high poverty middle schools. In four related analyses, we examine the levels of implementation achieved and impact of the reforms on various measures of achievement in the first 3 schools to implement the Talent Development (TD) Middle School Model's mathematics program that combines coherent research-based instructional materials from the University of Chicago School Mathematics Project with a multi-tiered teacher support system of sustained professional development and in-class coaching. A moderate level of implementation was achieved. TD students outperformed students from control schools on multiple measures of achievement. The average effect size, Delta, by the end of middle school was .24.

AB Although public interest in sustainability increases and consumer attitudes are mainly positive, behavioral patterns are not univocally consistent with attitudes. This study investigates the presumed gap between favorable attitude towards sustainable behavior and behavioral intention to purchase sustainable food products. The impact of involvement, perceived availability, certainty, perceived consumer effectiveness (PCE), values, and social norms on consumers' attitudes and intentions towards sustainable food products is analyzed. The empirical research builds on it survey with a sample of 456 young consumers, using a questionnaire and an experimental design with manipulation of key constructs through showing advertisements for sustainable dairy. Involvement with sustainability, certainty, and PCE have it significant positive impact on attitude towards buying sustainable dairy products, which in turn correlates strongly with intention to buy. Low perceived availability of sustainable products explains why intentions to buy remain low, although attitudes might be positive. Oil the reverse side, experiencing social pressure from peers (social norm) explains intentions to buy, despite rather negative personal attitudes. This study shows that more sustainable and ethical food consumption can be stimulated through raising involvement, PCE, certainty, social norms, and perceived availability.

AB Industrial ("white") biotechnology(1) promises to contribute to a more sustainable future. Compared to current production processes, cases have been identified where industrial biotechnology can decrease the amount of energy and raw materials used to make products and also reduce the amount of emissions and waste produced during production. However, switching from products based on chemical production processes and fossil fuels towards "biobased" products is at present not necessarily economically viable. This is especially true for bulk products, for example ethanol production from biomass. Therefore, scientists are also turning to genetic modification as a means to develop organisms that can produce at lower costs. These include not only micro-organisms, but also organisms used in agriculture for food and feed. The use of genetic modification for "deliberate release" purposes, in particular, has met great opposition in Europe. Many industrial biotechnology applications may, due to their scale, entail deliberate releases of GM organisms. Thus, the biobased economy brings back a familiar question; is it ethically justifiable, and acceptable to citizens, to expose the environment and society to the risks associated with GM, in order to protect that same environment and to sustain our affluent way of life? For a successful innovation towards a biobased economy, its proponents, especially producers, need to take into account (take responsibility for) such issues when developing new products and processes.

AB A new direct-current glow discharge has been designed and interfaced with a time-of-flight mass spectrometer. This glow discharge is simple to operate, sustainable in a helium environment at atmospheric pressure at the 40-100 mA level with burning voltages of 0.9-1.2 kV, and capable of generating singly charged atomic ions observable by mass spectrometry. Because of its high first ionization potential (24.6 eV), the presence of He+ in background mass spectra suggests that a significant amount of energy is available for the ionization of gaseous analyte species. In addition, noise power spectra obtained from helium ions in an analyte-free discharge indicate that discrete-frequency noise sources are not present in the atmospheric-pressure glow discharge; only 1/f noise and white noise are found. When this detection system is coupled with hydride generation, the analytical performance of the hydride generation-atmospheric-pressure glow discharge system is comparable with that typically obtained with an inductively coupled plasma ionization source. Although the precision and sensitivity of this system are slightly poorer, the discharge spectrum is free from polyatomic background ions that could otherwise yield problematic isobaric interferences. In addition, a reduction in the overall continuum background enables limits of detection for three routinely-investigated hydride species (arsenic, selenium, and mercury) down to 10 ppt to be realized.

AB Residual feed intake (RFI) is the difference between the actual and expected feed intake of an animal based on its BW and growth rate over a specified period. The biological mechanisms underlying the variation in feed efficiency in animals with similar BW and growth rate are not well understood. This study determined the relationship of feedlot feed efficiency, performance, and feeding behavior with digestion and energy partitioning of 27 steers. The steers were selected from a total of 306 animals based on their RFI following feedlot tests at the University of Alberta Kinsella Research Station. Selected steers were ranked into high RFI (RFI > 0.5 SD above the mean, n = 11), medium RFI (RFI > 0.5 SD above and below the mean, n = 8), and low RFI (RFI <-0.5 SD below the mean, n = 8). The respective BW SD for the RFI groups were 495.6 +/- 12.7, 529.1 +/- 18.6, and 501.2 +/- 15.5 kg. Digestibility and calorimetry trials were performed on a corn-or barley-based concentrate diet in yr 1 and 2, respectively, at 2.5 x maintenance requirements. Mean DMI (g/kg of BW(0.75)) during the measurements for high-, medium-, and low-RFI groups, respectively, were 82.7 +/- 2.0, 78.8 +/- 2.6, and 81.8 +/- 2.5 and did not differ (P > 0.10). Residual feed intake was correlated with daily methane production and energy lost as methane (r = 0.44; P < 0.05). Methane production was 28 and 24% less in low-RFI animals compared with high- and medium-RFI animals, respectively. Residual feed intake tended to be associated (P < 0.10) with apparent digestibilities of DM (r = -0.33) and CP (r -0.34). The RFI of steers was correlated with DE (r -0.41; P < 0.05), ME (r = -0.44; P < 0.05), heat production (HP; r = 0.68; P < 0.001), and retained energy (RE; r = -0.67; P < 0.001; energy values are expressed in kcal/kg of BW(0.75)). Feedlot partial efficiency of growth was correlated (P < 0.01) with methane production (r = -0.55), DE (r = 0.46), ME (r = 0.49), HP (r = -0.50), and RE (r = 0.62). With the exception of HP (r = 0.37; P < 0.05), feed conversion ratio was unrelated to the traits considered in the study. Feeding duration was correlated (P < 0.01) with apparent digestibility of DM (r = -0.55), CP (r = -0.47), methane production (r = 0.51), DE (r = -0.52), ME (r = -0.55), and RE (r = -0.60). These results have practical implications for the selection of animals that eat less at a similar BW and growth rate and for the environmental sustainability of beef production.

TI Public engagement with science? Local understandings of a vaccine trial
   in the Gambia
SO JOURNAL OF BIOSOCIAL SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
ID CONJUGATE VACCINE
AB This paper considers how parents engage with a large, internationally supported childhood pneumococcal vaccine trial in The Gambia. Current analysis and professional reflection on public engagement is strongly shaped by the imperatives of public health and research institutions, and is thus couched in terms of acceptance and refusal, and 'informed consent'. In contrast Gambian parents' perspectives on the trial are couched in conceptual and experiential terms that are linked to their wider dilemmas of raising infants amidst the hazards of globally connected village life. Ethnographic research reveals how for most parents, longer-term experiences of the organization managing the research (the UK Medical Research Council Laboratories in The Gambia) as a health-providing institution override their reflection on trial-specific aims. A decision to participate in the trial involves a perceived balance of benefit and danger-in the extreme, of free medical treatment, versus one's child being drained of blood for sale to Europe. Social relations (especially gender relations) shape this calculus and study participation. This case suggests how the idea of 'public engagement with science' in a globalized context might be recast, with implications for debates in biomedical ethics, and the sustainability of public participation in medical research.

AB Based on a theoretical exploration in a previous article, this paper empirically analyzes which issues of SD are taken into account by corporations and stakeholders in what way, and to what extent the concept of sustainable development (SD) can be achieved through stakeholder relations management (SRM) on the corporate level. An important basis for this empirical analysis is a referential framework, which specifies 14 issues of SD. In a first empirical step, the literature-based framework has been operationalized for the business world by analyzing sustainability reports. In a second empirical step, the operationalized framework served as the basis for a survey of selected MNCs. The analyses of the sustainability reports and the survey show how MNCs deal with particular issues of SD and what role they perceive particular stakeholders play. A key conclusion of the article is that SRM indeed promotes SD, but that it is no alternative to predictable government regulation.

AB After nearly 20 years of work by activists, fair trade, a movement establishing alternative trading organizations to ensure minimal returns, safe working conditions, and environmentally sustainable production, is now gaining steam, with increasing awareness and availability across a variety of products. However, this article addresses several major remaining challenges: (a) a lack of agreement about what fair trade really means and how it should be certified; (b) uneven awareness and availability across different areas, with marked differences between some parts of Europe and North America that reflect more fundamental debates about distribution; (c) larger questions about the extent of the potential contribution of fair trade to development under the current system, including limitations on the number and types of workers affected and the fair trade focus on commodity goods.

AB The sensory qualities of products from sustainable production systems are not well known, but important for development of such systems. To understand how wheat growing systems and baking processes influence white bread quality, six samples of wheat (Triticum aestivum, var.Ebi) from field trials harvested in two consecutive years, three grown in conventional farming systems and three in organic farming systems (biodynamic and ecological), were milled on the Bijhler laboratory mill. Flours were extracted to a fixed ash content (0.48% dmb) and analysed qualitatively and quantitatively. A total of twenty one bread types were baked: twelve according to the farinographic data and nine according to modified recipes. Ten selected and trained assessors completed a sensory analysis (a descriptive profiling test) with three replicates using seventeen sensory attributes.
   The slice area was established using image analysis. There were no differences in slice area between bread baked with conventionally or organically grown bread baked with organically grown wheat harvested in 1999, yet there were differences in 2000, such that slice area was larger for the conventional samples. The effect of year was greater than the effect of farming system or recipe modification, and differences in the sensory data was explained more by texture than by aroma and flavour attributes. Breads baked with wheat harvested in 1999 had significantly lower intensity of crumb attributes such as elasticity, smoothness and juiciness, but higher rancid flavour, springiness, compressibility, mastication resistance and lower colour intensity, as well as higher crust toughness, than did breads baked with wheat harvested in 2000. Breads baked with conventional flour had significantly higher elasticity and juiciness than breads baked with organic flour. Several interactions between year and farming system were revealed.

AB This is the first in a two-part paper that discusses the results of an evaluation of a 2-year 'cleaner production' (CP) demonstration project undertaken in New Zealand (NZ). The project's scale and methods were consistent with international best practice and the methods used were consistent with those advocated in traditional CP or 'pollution prevention' (PP) guides and manuals. On the surface, the project could be considered to have been successful. Like other apparently successful demonstration projects carried out elsewhere, the demonstration businesses identified a range of options that improved their environmental, economic and social performance (including savings of over NZ$4 million per annum, and significant reductions in materials, water and energy use, and improvements in productivity).
   However, a more in-depth evaluation of the project raised significant questions about the ability of traditional CP/PP programme components to bring about durable change. The evaluation identified a set of key internal organisational factors that strongly contributed towards the uptake of CP and affected the potential for on-going improvement. They were commitment, leadership, support, communication, staff involvement and programme design. This part of the paper (Part 1) provides an overview of the project, as well as the methodology used in the evaluation. It also includes a discussion of the results particularly as they relate to commitment and on-going improvement. Part 11 discusses the remaining key internal organisational factors. It also presents a framework that could potentially be used to enhance the performance of CP or similar types of programmes, particularly with regard to the key factors identified.

AB This is the second in a two-part paper that discusses the results of an evaluation of a multi-company, multi-sector 'cleaner production' (CP) or 'pollution prevention' (PP) demonstration project undertaken in New Zealand (NZ). Part I provided an overview of the demonstration project and the evaluation methods, and discussed the limitations of the project in terms of commitment and on-going improvement. This part discusses further limitations, specifically as they relate to leadership, support, communication and involvement within participating businesses. Part 11 also considers the issue of standardisation, suggesting that CP/PP programmes be designed so that they are compatible with the needs, activities and culture of each participating organisation. These further limitations are discussed in terms of key developments in organisation theory with the intent of providing insight into how outcomes could be improved. Part 11 also compares the extent to which areas for improvement are covered in traditional CP/PP programmes and common change management models. The paper concludes with the presentation of a framework that could potentially be used to overcome the limitations discussed in both papers. The framework draws on a range of change management models and focuses on the need for CP/PP programmes to bring about an iterative, critically reflective cycle of learning.
   The framework components include: a diagnostic phase (to enable the programme to be customised); visioning (to engage and involve all staff); iterative use of the vision (to motivate, inspire and drive continuous improvement); distinctive tasks (to enhance involvement); participatory design of the programme (to enhance commitment); and inclusion of top level managers at key stages in the process (to maximise leadership, commitment, progress and support). While the framework is suggested as an alternative to traditional CP/PP change management models, it is not intended to be prescriptive. It is intended rather to elicit critical reflection amongst practitioners and to encourage them to adopt a more strategic approach to their work with businesses. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Protecting the environment has been the priority of many sectors in our endeavor to ensure sustainable development. Implementation of green energy development based on the use of biomass is in the right path in adopting a holistic approach in the promotion of renewable energy. Malaysia has very substantial potential for biomass energy utilization given its equatorial climate that is ideal for dense tropical forest growth and agricultural vegetation. Biomass power potentials from wood processing and palm oil were estimated at 280 TJ and 250 TJ, respectively. By the year 2010, the biomass energy potential is expected to increase to 820 TJ. The paper describes the effective use of biomass as the first of the renewable energy sources to be developed for large-scale applications, especially in the palm oil industry and the methodology for energy harness by innovative utilization of waste from palm oil cultivation and processing.

AB The alcohol industry in China makes an important contribution to the national economy. However, the associated pollution problems cause gradual deterioration of the ambient environment and adverse impacts on the local community. Cleaner production (CP) technology, as an effective way to reduce waste emission and save resources, has been widely employed in the alcohol industry across the developed countries. In China, although such technologies have been applied in a number of factories, an integrated assessment and implementation procedure is lacking for proceeding with practical CP technologies for alcohol factories in China. To solve such problems, a series of cleaner production options are proposed and assessed in this study. Five groups of CP options were screened, on factory survey, expert questionnaires, and integrated assessment. With the consideration of environmental impacts and economic efficiency, four CP options combined with various advanced CP technologies, such as high-concentration wort fermenting, CO2 reuse, different pressure distilling, methane and fertilizer production, were proposed. To verify the proposed options, a case study was carried out in the Shouguang Alcohol Factory (SAF), East China. The characteristics of resources consumption and waste emission during the production process were identified. A comprehensive evaluation of the proposed options was conducted from different aspects. An integrated cleaner production system based on the proposed options was formed and then implemented in the factory. Through the four years of practice, the productivity/quality of alcohol product were improved, but and the reduction of waste and pollution were achieved as well as a marked increase in water/energy savings. This study provides theoretical and practical support for extensive application of cleaner production technologies and sustainable development in the alcohol industry of China. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

   ethics
AB Corporate sustainable development (CSD) can help to force the life sciences industry (LSI) to move from responsibility towards accountability.
   In terms of sustainability issues, which currently affect and occupy the LSI and their stakeholders, one could speak of 4 generations:
   - The local side-effects of operations, production, distribution and use. - The effects and risks of the used and applied technologies and methods. - The affordability and access to essential available treatments and products. - The necessity and need for new essential products or treatments for neglected diseases.
   In order to make corporations accountable, there have been many efforts in the field of evaluation. These efforts mostly remain very general. The problem is however that the different stakeholders have diverse understandings of the various sustainability issues. The paper proposes a 2-phased stakeholder-oriented evaluation method for evaluating CSD-strategies on specific sustainability issues of the LSI in Basel, Switzerland. During the first phase, corporate commitment is challenged against the stakeholders' expectations. In the second phase, relevant stakeholders evaluate the effective corporate performance against the corporate commitment.
   The evaluation method was extensively tested with the stakeholders of the LSI in 5 case studies on the 4 issue generations. The method turned out to work and delivered interesting insight into managing sustainability issues. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Product-service systems in the automotive industry: the case of
   micro-factory retailing
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
LA English
DT Article
DE automotive industry; sustainability; product-service systems;
   micro-factory retailing
AB Solutions to the economic and environmental impacts of the automotive industry have largely focused on technological innovation at the level of products or processes. This paper argues that, in order to achieve sustainability, change processes must be undertaken at the functional and systemic level.
   The concept of product-service systems (PSS) represents a valuable opportunity to introduce such changes. PSS is predicated on new forms of product ownership, stewardship, design and producer-consumer interaction. The challenge now is to investigate ways in which the PSS concept might be introduced at the empirical level.
   The paper suggests that the adoption of micro-factory retailing (MFR) ideas offer a means of introducing such a system-level change in the automotive industry. MFR is based on novel approaches to vehicle design that facilitate the economic viability of small-scale localised manufacturing sites. It is argued that such an approach to vehicle production, allows the adoption of a full scale PSS at local levels. Furthermore, via aspects such as the unification of the commerce and manufacturing function, and the proximity of manufacturing and servicing sites to users, the MFR approach may also offer distinct advantages compared with prevailing visions of PSS.

AB Ternary diagrams are presented as graphic tools to assist environmental accounting and environmental decision-making based on emergy analysis [Odum HT. Environmental accounting - emergy environmental decision making. John Wiley & Sons; 1996. 370 pp. [1]]. Beyond the unquestionable advantages of graphic interpretation over table analysis, the use of ternary diagrams or phase diagrams, widely used for physical chemistry evaluation of three component systems, permits the use of phase diagram properties to assess the dependence of the system upon renewable and non-renewable inputs, the environmental support for dilution and abatement of process emissions and the system efficiency. The prompt visualization of the emergy accounting data makes possible to compare processes and systems with and without ecosystem services, to evaluate improvements and to follow the system performance over time. With the aim of ternary diagrams, aspects such as the interaction between systems and the interactions between systems and the environment can be readily recognized and evaluated.

TI Corporate social responsibility in the mining industry: Exploring trends
   in social and environmental disclosure
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
LA English
DT Article
DE CSR; social and environmental disclosure; trends; policy
ID EXTRACTION INDUSTRIES; SUSTAINABILITY
AB In recent years, concerns about the sustainability and social responsibility (CSR) of businesses have become an increasingly high profile issue in many countries and industries, none more so than the mining industry. For mining, one outcome of the CSR agenda is the increasing need for individual companies to justify their existence and document their performance through the disclosure of social and environmental information. This paper explores recent trends in the reporting of such impacts and issues in the global mining industry. It offers a detailed review of the development of the media of social and environmental disclosure in the mining industry, and of the factors that drive the development of such disclosure. A temporal analysis of the recent trends in disclosure using a case study of the world's 10 largest mining companies is presented. Whilst there is evidence of increasing sophistication in the development of social and environmental disclosure, there is considerable variation in the maturity of reporting content and styles of these companies. The paper offers a simple classification of reporting companies, from 'leaders' to 'laggards'. Stronger leadership and co-operation from the top reporting companies is necessary to support the laggards of the industry. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Industrial ecology (IE) is an emerging framework adopted in the manufacturing, construction, and process industries to provide innovative solutions in strategic planning, leading to cleaner operation and production. An IE framework integrates a large number of processes, economic constraints, and environmental, health and safety considerations for optimized resource utilization. This paper provides a review of environmental management practices in the mining and minerals industry, emphasizing two concepts: IE and cleaner production. The mining and minerals industry provides primary materials for industrial activities; as such, it is an important component in the "industrial ecosystem." This industry is subject to very stringent social and environmental scrutiny, while providing society with required natural resources to meet essential sustainable development requirements. The implementation of an IE framework in the sector will contribute to sustainable development. (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Over the last few years, the idea of 'sustainable mining' has, thanks to industry sponsorship, been working its way into the agenda of many international processes. There is now a push in many countries to invite in multinational mining companies with the idea that there is a "new, sustainable mining" which is different from the old, bad practices of the past. Yet, what has actually changed in the industry to match this shift in rhetoric? From the perspective of mine-affected communities nothing seems to have changed. Their land is still being taken from them without giving their free, prior and informed consent, and they are suffering the same ill effects on their ways of life, health and environment. This paper will illustrate how under this rhetoric, the mining industry 'emperor' has the same old naked ambitions. (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Generally, the gold mining industry has a negative image because it is potentially highly polluting, its costs often externalized on local communities that host its operations. Recently, there has been growing activism in most countries where rich gold deposits exist. Although the industry has many drawbacks, it can potentially confer many benefits, especially for the people of the developing world, by providing employment and foreign exchange. In the context of the mining sustainable development debate, this paper examines the environmental performance of the gold mining industry in developing countries, and its impacts on resident populations and communities.

SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION

ID ENERGY
AB Non-renewable resources, including metals, minerals, and fossil fuels, are being consumed at ever-increasing rates. Only a small proportion of this consumption of natural capital is being converted to other forms of durable human capital; the majority, especially of fuels, is being consumed unrecoverably. Worse is the fact that the majority of the benefits from this consumption accrue inequitably, not only between the developed and developing world, but also within these worlds where income disparity is increasing dramatically.
   One solution to the problem of non-renewable resource depletion is to change the valuation of these materials, such that their prices reflect fully internalized costs plus the "cost of replacement." Given that non-renewable resources are irreplaceable, this latter cost should be set high enough to encourage extensive conservation through recycling and reuse. A place to start in revaluing non-renewable resources such as metals is through royalty rates on mined product. Currently, royalty rates are very low, and are often charged only on profits. I propose that minimum royalty rates on revenues should be set by international agreement, and that these rates should be slowly increased over several years to allow markets time to adjust. In this way, consumers would be made directly aware of the irreplaceable value of minerals and metals, leading to a change in usage patterns, and the benefits of resource extraction would be more equitably distributed to producer nations. Ensuring that these new revenues are actually invested back into society as sustainable development requires a commitment to quality governance. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   people
AB Between 1997 and 2002, Inco Limited's proposed major nickel mining project near Voisey's Bay on the north coast of Labrador was the subject of an innovative environmental assessment and a set of surrounding and consequential negotiations. Through these processes, the proponent and other participants wrestled directly, often openly, and by some interim measures successfully with the project's potential contribution to local and regional sustainability. The resulting agreements to proceed were heavily influenced by the precedent-setting assessment, which imposed a "contribution to sustainability" test on the proposed undertaking. Given the profound differences in background, culture, priorities and formal power involved, as well as the record of tensions in the history of this case and before, the agreements also represent a considerable achievement in conflict resolution. The paper examines the reasons for, and lessons from, use of a sustainability-centred approach in this case. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID MERCURY
AB The Caroni River, a tributary of the Orinoco River in the State of Bolivar, Venezuela, has been subjected to mining since the end of the last century. Until the 1990s, hundreds of artisanal miners operated along a 70 km stretch of the river using rudimentary suction dredges to extract gold and diamonds from sediments. Although artisanal miners created considerable wealth along the river, the local community has also been negatively impacted by the social and environmental effects that characterize this sector. The flooding of many parts of the Lower Caroni River, in conjunction with the development of a large hydroelectric-power complex, changed the conditions for dredging operations.
   A Canada-based company is proposing to open the recently-created hydro-electrical lakes to a Mineral Dredging Project. The early forecasting of potential socioeconomic and environmental impacts would be a valuable tool to build a sustainable business case that facilitates the integration of the project into a sensitive environment. These strategies, currently used in other economic sectors, would contribute to the identification of opportunities to negotiate mutually beneficial agreements with stakeholders of the Project, and reduce the risk of conflict, in this particular case, with the hydroelectric company (EDELCA), former small-scale miners and other stakeholders.
   This paper, based on the pre-feasibility study of the Project, assesses the applicability of such tools to the mineral dredging and to junior mining company projects in general. (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The need for and the benefits of a more sustainable approach to business management have been widely discussed in the literature. Many organizations have engaged in environmental management initiatives to improve their environmental performance and have found other benefits to the process, such as financial savings and reduced risk of liability. However, many constraints can inhibit the transformation to an environmentally conscious and responsible organization. These constraints include issues related to organizational culture and change management. To overcome these constraints and succeed in implementing a successful environmental management initiative, the literature suggests the importance for members of the organization of understanding the environmental impacts and policies of the organization through participation in environmental awareness training efforts that produces enduring knowledge and commitment. Armed with this knowledge, employees can then understand how the environment can affect and be affected by their duties and decisions. Various companies have used different approaches to environmental management training. It is important that organizations evaluate the efficiency of their training investment to ensure that the benefits will be generated. A case study of two electricity companies is used to illustrate the importance of evaluating environmental awareness efforts. The results of the study suggest that the training performed did not sufficiently increase employee environmental awareness of the company's environmental impacts despite a considerable time and financial investment in a one-time environmental awareness training program. Results arc briefly discussed and recommendations are made to improve the results of the training investment. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

DE Toronto Region Sustainability Program; pollution prevention (P2); small

   performance
AB The Toronto Region Sustainability Program (TRSP) is a multi-year action-and-results oriented program which provides small to medium-sized manufacturing enterprises (SME) (defined as < 500 employees at facility level) in the GTA with pollution prevention (P2) technical assistance, coupled with a financial incentive to address the root causes of their pollutants and waste streams and improve their environmental performance. The program has been successful in establishing partnerships with three orders (levels) of government and a third party delivery agent-the Ontario Centre for Environmental Technology Advancement (OCETA)-to achieve significant reductions in pollutants/waste generation and to promote the implementation of pollution prevention practices within SME manufacturing facilities. This paper shares insights on how the program works and uses case studies as illustrative examples to highlight the P2 methods adopted, the resulting environmental burden reductions, as well as the value-added benefits to the TRSP clients' business bottom line. Furthermore, this paper outlines the findings of a survey conducted by OCETA to identify TRSP clients' key drivers for program participation, their implementation status, and the challenges encountered in implementing P2 projects. It is hoped that the insights from this paper will expand the boundaries of P2 knowledge within the P2 community, and motivate SMEs in various sectors to incorporate P2 as a sustainable business strategy.

DE cleaner production; implementation; regulatory climate; incentive
   programs; sustainable development; aerospace; automotive; wine; textile;
   wood industry; coffee; dairy; regulation; incentive
AB Cleaner production stakeholders have a strong desire for industry to consider cleaner production opportunities in their facilities and once they are assessed, to follow through on their implementation. This paper examines local and international initiatives within the Canadian stakeholder community (including government, NGOs, consultants, industry) that contribute to the initiation and implementation of cleaner production in industry. Specifically, stakeholders have consciously drafted regulatory compliance, education, co-funding incentives, and development-based cleaner production programs. As illustrated by case studies from six industries, the programs work together to create a climate favorable for implementation of cleaner production concepts and approaches. Based on the cleaner production drivers and barriers identified by research, the programs are well designed. However, as with cleaner production itself, there is always room for further improvement. Specifically: (i) regulatory compliance programs and timetables Should leave room for cleaner production (versus end-of-pipe) approaches; (ii) cleaner production co-funding programs should tat-get small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) and require them to use a multimedia approach (air, water, waste); (iii) education programs should incorporate demonstration assessments, feasibility assessments of common recommendations, and follow-up communication to foster implementation and continuous improvement; and (iv) mandated cleaner production should include absolute (i.e. waste/tonne production) rather than relative standards (i.e. X% reduction from status quo) in order to avoid penalizing historically proactive corporations.

AB Rising waste levels in Canada necessitate renewed waste reduction efforts, with a focus on prevention. Extended Producer Responsibility is an important policy tool, which has the potential to impact materials management systems and drive pollution prevention efforts. This article contrasts the European approach to producer responsibility with "product stewardship" initiatives in Canada, highlighting British Columbia's experience with "full product stewardship". Lessons from European and Canadian stewardship programs highlight the importance of designing EPR programs with clear legislation that encourages sustainable product design by delivering a full range of signals to producers. Recommendations are developed for advancing EPR in Canada. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada is developing eco-efficiency indicators (EEIs) in an effort to build a framework for a sustainable production system for the Canadian food and beverage industry (FBI). This paper presents the rationale and the framework of the project currently under development addressing the following environmental issues: energy use, emission of greenhouse gases, water use and wastewater generation, organic residues, and packaging residues. Proposed EEIs are intensity indicators and recycling ratios, and include environmental pressure modulators. They will be developed based on collected data and estimated impact levels, and reported by FBI sub-sector, geographical location, and establishment size. Objectives and methodologies are outlined Problems on getting quality and reliable data on selected environmental issues are emphasized. The methodology will be published in 2005 and first results are due by 2008. Benchmarking and linkage to specific processing operations and management practices will help regulators and industries in promoting and implementing cleaner production initiatives and will lead to operational cost savings, product innovation, and enhanced competitiveness.

TI Using system dynamics to model the interaction between environmental and

SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION

DT Article
DE mining; environmental policy; sustainable development; modelling
AB This paper describes a graphical and mathematical representation of the interactions between environmental and economic policies governing the long-term behaviour of a complex system - namely, the interrelationships governing the flow of mineral investment funds. The paper is underpinned by a computer simulation model developed in the system dynamics tradition.
   Through quantitative analysis of existing data, the model exposes, within the context of sustainable development, the underlying assumptions used as a basis for corporate decisions. Through the compression of time, the model provides a means of taking these assumptions to their logical conclusions. Exposing assumptions in this way leaves less room for misinterpretation and provides a solid basis for enhancing the understanding of system structure. It is by better understanding system structure that more effective sustainable development policies may be designed and implemented. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

DE integrated management systems; compatibility; coordinated generic

AB Different approaches to integration of management systems (ISO 9001, ISO 14001, OHSAS 18001 and SA 8000) with various levels of ambition have emerged. The tendency of increased compatibility between these standards has paved the road for discussions of. how to understand the different aspects of integration. The focus of the article is primarily to discuss three ambition levels of integration: from increased compatibility of system elements over coordination of generic processes to an embeddedness of an integrated management system (IMS) in a culture of learning and continuous improvements. At present, national IMS standards are being developed, and the IMS standards in Denmark and Spain are being analysed regarding the ambition level for integration. Should the ISO organisation decide to make a standard for IMS, then it would be necessary to consider the different levels of integration in order to make a coherent standard. So far, management systems have had major focus within organisations. However, in order to create competitive advantages for the organisation and contribute to a sustainable development, the IMS has to be expanded to include the whole product chain and all the stakeholders.

DE utilization; rate; value; durable goods; resource productivity
AB The utilization rate and value of goods should be considered the central elements of a new global strategy to be adopted in the pursuit of sustainable consumption and sustainable business.
   The definition and measurement of the utilization rate are not a simple task, but one that has to be performed in order to contribute towards the radical modification of the present situation and trends, which tend to lead towards a very low utilization rate, and consequently, to a very low level of resource productivity.
   The present work attempts to establish which factors influence the degree and value of utilization of goods, and how these factors may be measured; it then proposes an indicator which takes into consideration all parameters influencing the manner of utilization. The indicator, if implemented at all levels and countries, can make it possible to elaborate a double-purpose ranking: the first expressing the absolute capacity of each good to satisfy at the same time, individuals and society; the second the capacity to do it in economic manner.
   The objective comparisons that can be made for different or equivalent goods, in the same or different countries, may be used to see which are the most or less effective of them with reference to the fundamental aspect of "resource productivity", and, consequently, to make choices able to increase it.

AB This paper assesses the effectiveness of using the Delphi method in constructing an implementation plan for university sustainability policies using the case study of Dalhousie University. The objectives of the case study were twofold. First, the study endeavored to develop ideas as to the most desirable and feasible ways in which to incorporate the sustainability policy into the activities and structure of the university. Second, the study sought to assess the applicability of the Delphi technique for consulting with stakeholders in the development of an implementation plan, as this tool had not been used in this specific context before.

DE sustainability; student projects; university education
AB Curtin Environment Awareness Team (CEAT) is a group of volunteers at Curtin University of Technology in Perth, Western Australia, who work together to promote awareness, activities and information dissemination related to sustainable use of the university campus. In 2003 an attempt was made to integrate a CEAT concern relating to a declining habitat for bird and animal life around a campus lake, with an undergraduate problem-based design project in the School of Architecture. After the students' work was completed, CEAT reviewed the projects and selected three schemes for possible inclusion in the program of capital works for the campus. CEAT members and students were surveyed after the design project was completed. The survey results indicated that CEAT members considered that student involvement enhanced the quality, scope and likely implementation of the project. The student survey results indicated that this project raised their awareness of the complexity of addressing sustainable use of the campus and identified the potential influence of architect designed projects on the natural environment. However, in spite of formal acknowledgement of the value of the project by the Vice Chancellor of the university, there was no indication that the university plans to move from the current ad hoc approach towards sustainability either in the management of the campus or in the core teaching programs.

AB Many years have passed since sustainable development (SD) became world famous in the Brundtland Commission publication, "Our Common Future"; however, still many universities are unaware of it or confuse it with environmental sustainability. The SD concept contrasts with existing teaching methods, mainly focused into resource depletion. This paper focuses on SD incorporation and institutionalization into universities. This process is bound to face resistance from inside and outside stakeholders. Several approaches and strategies are presented to overcome this resistance. The paper also presents the types of conflicts that might arise and the role of the campus SD champion in preventing or solving them. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This article is based on an analysis of Lund University that took place during the summer and autumn of 2004 (available for download at www.iiiee.lu.se, click library and publications). The university had experienced a loss of momentum in their progress regarding environmental issues. The purpose of the study was to identify barriers to including sustainability-related content throughout Lund University curricula, and eventually to develop solutions to eliminate/overcome these barriers. The article describes how Meadows' "Places to intervene in a system" [Meadows D. Leverage points: places to intervene in a system. Hartland, VT, USA: Sustainability Institute; 1999] was used as a tool to systematically discover these barriers. The same intervention places are used as a basis for deriving solutions to eliminate/overcome the barriers. The main conclusions of this article are that Meadows list can be a useful tool to
   a. systematically identify and characterise the barriers towards achieving the organisational objective of incorporating SD into courses and curricula;
   b. identify ways to overcome these barriers;
   c. increase chances that these barriers are addressed with sufficient leverage.
   The authors also experienced that the work method described here provides excellent fuel for creativity. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This article presents a comprehensive managerial model for a sustainable university created by D.Sc. L. Velazquez with empirical data collected from about 80 higher education institutions around the world. The sustainable university model offers a clear perspective about how people responsible for sustainability initiatives achieve their initial momentum to progress to advanced steps in the process to become a sustainable university.
   This model depicts a structured framework that is comprised of four phases in a strategic management process. In these phases, four diverging strategies, and many practices undertaken by key players of sustainability initiatives in higher education institutions are analyzed. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

DE capacity development; problem oriented and project based learning;
   university outreach; auto-leaming society; sustainable development
AB Capacity building for sustainable development has been a targeted activity over the last decade through university and university consortia networking. Universities from Africa (Botswana and South Africa), Asia (Malaysia and Thailand), Central America (Costa Rica, El Salvador and Nicaragua) and Europe (Denmark) participated with graduate students and faculty. Initially, some programmes emphasised research and others higher education, but eventually a blend of research and higher education was found to be more productive. Links to external partners in public and private business have been established and have proven to be successful in terms of mutual benefits. Activities comprised joint evolution of new study curricula (including a shift of the learning paradigm to problem-oriented and project-based learning), human resource development, and joint research. The results are promising in terms of concrete results within each type of activity and together they provide vital steps in capacity building in tertiary education to the benefit of development and environment. Universities should play a central role in such global efforts to strengthen tertiary education. Modes of operation are still deficient, but "universities as development hubs" is suggested as a concept to study further and modify to needs. Some of the results and their implications are presented in this paper and more are documented in the references that are cited. In short, universities, in joint action with business and society at large are necessary though not sufficient prerequisites for constructing and maintaining knowledge societies. Such action is equally important in established and developing economies. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Restructuring teacher education for sustainability: student involvement
   through a "strengths model"
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
LA English

DE education for sustainable development; ESD; k-12 Teacher education
AB In responding to the demand for major review of teacher education to meet the needs and challenges of the twenty-first century, the Faculty of Education at Griffith University in Queensland, Australia is in the throes of a major review of its primary teacher education program. This review is taking place in the midst of University wide debate on the nature and scope of Education for Sustainable Development (ESD). While consensus exists of the importance of ESD, debate continues regarding programs, policies, and practices.
   Education staff members feel strongly that new programs should encompass knowledge, issues, perspectives, skills, and values central to ESD, but remain uncertain about how this could best be achieved. The "strengths model" where every discipline and every staff member and student can contribute is being utilised by the working parties and is likely to be adopted as a means of ESD.
   To determine a benchmark for inclusion of components of ESD, and as one stage of including students in the decision-making process, a survey was conducted in February 2004 that sought to determine general environmental attitudes, specific practices and perceptions of a need to change.
   The survey indicated that a large portion of the students enrolled in preservice teacher education at this University were very concerned about environmental issues and felt that their preparation as teachers should include aspects of teaching about sustainability. The survey also indicated however, that the knowledge base regarding environmental issues was minimal and insight into the social, cultural and economic complexities of ESD was quite superficial. Students openly expressed a lack of confidence in their ability to make wise decisions or take appropriate action.
   This paper describes the context and strategies of the current restructure/reorientation of the preservice teacher program, highlighting the current and potential impacts of student involvement in the process. (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

DT Article
DE games and simulations in education; learning through simulations;
   simulations for teaching sustainability
AB This paper discusses the roles of games in experiential learning for sustainability. It includes applied emphases upon four topics: (1) The challenges of sustainable development education with the need for interdisciplinarity, knowledge, skills and attitudinal training and with a special focus upon the urgent needs for paradigm, context and practice changes to help ensure that we make progress toward sustainable societies. We emphasize that these characteristics challenge existing teaching and educational philosophies and methods. (2) The theory of experiential learning, as developed by David Kolb in the nineteen eighties. We underscore that experiential learning is a good model for education for sustainability. (3) The usefulness of games as tools in learning processes. Various aspects of games are discussed such as the functions of games' and 'the different categories of games,' and 'the role of games in learning and particular in experiential learning.' These three aspects form the theoretical part of the paper. (4) Brief reviews of some illustrative games. The authors provide practical advice on how to play games in the context of learning for SD. They underscore facets such as the contextualization of games, technical aspects of playing games and the debriefing after the games have been played. The authors conclude the paper with conclusions that games are potentially relevant in all of the four learning phases of experiential learning. Games are especially relevant in phase four. In this phase games can contribute to helping learners to effect shifts in their personal paradigms, context and practice that are needed for sustainable development. The final conclusion is that many games exist and have been proven to be helpful. Educators are invited to change their curricula to facilitate usage of games as integral components of their educational philosophy tools and practice. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

DE university-community partnership; sustainability; simulation games;

AB This paper reviews the evolution of an inter-organizational partnership between Ball State University and local organizations to develop the Second Chance Game (SCG), an environmental education sustainability awareness game that has been tested with sixth grade students in Muncie, Indiana and that has become a part of the educational program of the Minnetrista Cultural Center and Oakhurst Gardens. The SCG game helps students discover how to live responsibly on the land, and to understand that every decision they make (to obtain and process food, mine or harvest resources, build shelters, produce and consume products) has an impact on local and regional systems and resource-flows. In this paper, partnerships are presented as a strategy to help organizations deal with similar challenges and also as a strategy to increase global awareness about environmental issues and to build environmental responsibility. The authors discuss partnerships using the SCG as a case study. First, the authors review the process of formation, evolution, and maintenance of the partnership to design the SCG game and other components. They then present the game and a stand-alone preparatory program for middle school teachers to help their students play the game, as specific products. The paper closes with a reflection about the potential of partnerships for sustainable development initiatives between universities and local stakeholders. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Knowledge found in the logic, the structure and the ways of use of environmental literacy is represented as a knowledge network (a collection of educational scenarios), based on an ontology. A prototype environmental pollution ontology and three self-contained sample educational scenarios have been developed. The training approach helps students to understand the contemporary global environmental issues, how they are linked and interrelated and to consider the differing views of these issues, before reaching a decision or judgment.

AB This paper deals with teaching participatory backcasting to engineering students as part of the graduate specialisation in sustainability at TU Delft. A course is described using backcasting, sustainable future visions, a systems orientation, and interviews with stakeholders and multidisciplinary project work. The essentials of backcasting are presented before an outline and results from the backcasting course are described. It is concluded that it has been possible to develop a 'light' version of participatory backcasting that can be taught to engineering students in a useful way during a course of 3 study credits (4 ects; European credit transfer system (ects): 1 ects equals 28 h (3.5 days) of study; the previously used study credit equalled 40 h (5 days) of study). The paper also outlines some results of the Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) project at TU Delft. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   studies: an innovative approach for solving complex, real-world problems
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
LA English
DT Article
DE case study; interdisciplinarity; self-regulated learning; sustainable
   development; transdisciplinarity; complex problem solving
AB Sustainable development and the interplay between its ecological, social, and economic dimensions can be regarded as a highly complex task. As a logical consequence, educating for sustainable development also has a complex character. Traditional unidirectional educational processes are only of very limited use when educating for sustainable development: Firstly, the initial state of the considered system (case) cannot be described precisely; secondly, the target state of the system is also not sufficiently known; and thirdly, the process between initial state and target state and potential barriers that might have to be passed are also not exactly known. Pure analytically based solutions are therefore, not available; a dynamic mutual learning process is required instead.
   Mutual learning based on real-world cases requires an interdisciplinary point of view, transdisciplinary problem-solving processes, and self-regulated and self-responsible learning. Consequently, besides analytical capabilities and deterministic process planning, dealing with the complex problem of sustainable development requires creativity, social competencies and specific communication skills in order to cope with the dynamic change that characterizes the developments in most facets of society and nature.
   A "vassal" that puts together all these requirements towards an educational process for sustainable development can be a transdisciplinary case study approach: In Austria this was first applied by the University of Graz within the "Erzherzog Johann case study". In order to educate for sustainable development, the students had to work on a "real-world problem", the development of possible ways to achieve ecologically, economically and socially sustainable development of the abandoned iron ore mining region of Eisenerz in the middle of Austria. As a core characteristic of this "real-world" case study, besides the cooperation among students, teachers and researchers of the university, the interaction with stakeholders of the region was of outstanding importance.
   Within transdisciplinary case studies students, teachers and researchers have to abandon the role paradigm of the teacher as provider of information and the students as "consumers" of the provided information. Knowledge and competences imparted in university classes need to be applied simultaneously within the real-world case to allow a demand-driven process of mutual learning in which students are self-responsible and decide which tools to apply in the process of attaining sustainable development. Because of the dynamics of this process, students experience the process of sustainable development instead of purely memorizing its characteristics. The process of educating for sustainable development and practical applied sustainability therefore, becomes sustainable. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID TEXTILE-INDUSTRY; ORGANIZATIONS; SYSTEMS
AB The utility of applying a virtual learning network model for illustrating successful triple bottom line transitions-one that integrates the ecological, economic, and social dimensions of cleaner production-is illustrated by a successful approach to promote "green chemistry" in the North Carolina textile wet-processing industry. This case is unique in demonstrating the quality of this process to develop cleaner production methods; it shows how reducing aquatic toxicity and harmful environmental effects in a "real world" situation depends on successful efforts to build, manage, and maintain an inter-organizational network of multiple stakeholders. This network included industries in the textile production chain, their local and provincial communities, regulators and policy makers. The utilization of cases such as this in the business school pedagogy expands understanding of the role of sustainable practices in enterprise management. The value of this specific case in promoting the understanding of such networks was demonstrated in a recent MBA experience when students trained in these areas linked diverse stakeholders and applied the triple bottom line perspective in traditional business simulation exercises in an MBA capstone course. Such cases can also effectively prepare students for actual challenges facing managers in the rapidly changing business environment. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper reports on Ball State University's activities in the area of education for sustainability and current activities to develop an Internet-based Introduction to Sustainability course. As the course will be Internet-based, it will mesh well with and can serve as the introductory course in the sustainability curriculum of Ball State University Land Design Institute's international network of Sustainability Consortia, and can be used in sustainability education programs within the context of other international partnerships. This course will serve as a foundation for that effort and for a broader curriculum that can be delivered across cultures. Ball State University's Clustered Minors in Environmentally Sustainable Practices utilizes three courses to address the social, environmental, and economic aspects of sustainability: environmental ethics; ecology; and environmental economics. The intention is to compose a course comprising elements from all three dimensions. The course will include Internet content and assignments and will exploit the emerging ability for Internet-based teleconferencing for real-time interactions among students and faculty at diverse international sites.

AB The role of education and training is increasingly implicit, if not explicit, in environmental legislation and in management system standards. The consequence of these pressures is that organisations must develop their personnel for continuous improvement in environmental performance. Continuing professional development is a lifelong activity that can be supported by distance learning. Some approaches to this are described including various electronic resources, but all emphasise the broad range of issues that come into environmental decision making. The approaches also reflect the growth in corporate environmental reporting and the disclosure of environmental performance indicators. Performance measures of different media are outlined, while the efficiency, especially in relation to energy use, makes distance learning an application of cleaner production principles.

AB Engineering educators in South Africa have to introduce students to a particularly complex set of issues in sustainable development, which can only be achieved through engaged, active learning. In 2003 the Chemical Engineering Programme at the University of Cape Town introduced a mandatory 4th year course on Business, Society and Environment. The course bears a credit rating equivalent to 200 learning hours. The coverage of topics and the set of intended learning outcomes is ambitious, spanning concepts of societal and financial benefits, engineering economic analysis, entrepreneurship, physical risk in terms of health, safety and environment, stakeholder involvement, clean production and clean technology, and engineering ethics. Student success rates have been high in the first two years (100 and 93%), but some concern remains as to the actual learning outcomes, particularly in relation to the depth of learning, and the ability of non-first language speakers of English to fully engage with the course material.

DT Article
DE STW; education; sustainability; conceptual design; chemical process
AB Delft University has an established track record in educating MSc students the art of designing chemical processes and products. To foster its future position an experimental conceptual design program has been set up. In this program sustainability requirements are used to stimulate creativity. Our vision is that (designs of) processes, products and systems should fit in a sustainable technological world (STW). The STW is in balance with the other great cycles on Earth, being the exchange of water between hydrosphere and atmosphere and the exchange of carbon dioxide between atmosphere and biosphere. The STW has, like the biosphere and hydrosphere, a certain upper mass (110 Gton) and energy (8800 GW). The STW itself is evolutionary and cannot be designed, yet its content-technological artifacts-is designed. Newly designed artifacts requiring an average life span of 25 years (one human generation), should fit the STW. The total annual product renewal of the STW is 4.4 Gton/year and the energy consumption 64 MJ/kg. These numbers total both industrial production as well as energy spent by consumers using the artifacts. Conceptual designs of chemical processes should fit in this concept of a STW. This means that processes requiring a high energy level are subject to change, for they limit society's patterns of energy consumption. Chemical processes demanding a lot of chemical energy are reduction processes: primary processes (roasting ores and biomass) and secondary processes (dissociations and dehydrogenations). In this article a conceptual design of both types of processes is presented. The first results show that their energy consumption fits the STW and points towards new design solutions for chemical processes, new applications of chemical products and new relationships with other technological sciences.

AB Is technology hindering sustainable development or can it be used to stimulate sustainable development? It is becoming clearer that technological innovation can be a useful tool for achieving sustainable development. That is, if the technologist is aware of the boundaries that should be considered when working in a sustainable way; and is knowledgeable about how to use the tools that can be used to work in a sustainable way. Therefore, making technology students aware of these boundaries and tools is an important educational task for universities. Such education should, in our view, include two subjects. (1) Giving them insight into the concepts of sustainable development. What is sustainable development? What are sustainability problems? What are the causes of these problems? Which strategies and approaches for solving them are available? (2) Giving them insight into the technology development process. How does the technology development process work? Which factors influence and steer it? What is the influence of technology on society and on sustainable development? The Technology Assessment group at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands has developed several courses on the combination of these two subjects, integrating research results in the fields of sustainable development and technology dynamics. In this article the contents of these courses are described. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The integration of sustainability issues into a regular industrial design engineering product innovation course is a challenge. Simply requiring that student's assignments show sustainable product concepts that are also sound from a traditional business perspective is neither motivating nor realistic. Experiences at Delft University of Technology show that in course development, one of the most important aspects is credibility in written (supervision) and spoken form (business case description, course format). Additionally, putting sustainability in a wider scope, to include social issues like safety, is likely to build enthusiasm with both students and staff without sustainability backgrounds, and is likely to result in better learning processes and assignments, with a higher credibility and more acceptance.

AB This paper presents the experiences of a multidisciplinary team of professors during the design, implementation and evolution of a core course on Sustainable Development, at the graduate level for all Masters programs within the Monterrey Tec System (ITESM). During the last ten years, the SD course evolved and we tried several teaching techniques, methods and platforms from a traditional classroom to a distant teaching/leaming, up to an on-line course. The most important changes have been the content and the impact of the course upon the personal and professional lives of the students. Initially it was mostly an informative course about the most important environmental issues and their social and economic consequences. The next step evolved to a mixture of informative and formative course with a holistic approach. Nowadays, the students leave this course as empowered 'agents of change' knowing how their everyday actions and choices have an impact on the environment, our society and the well-being of the future generations.

AB Education is the foundation for achieving sustainable development. With the purpose of facing sustainable challenges in terms of climate change, water and energy consumption, Technical University of Catalonia (UPC) has promoted the culture of energy efficiency in new generations of professionals that will work in the field of building construction. A group of 21 students taking the final official Diploma in Architecture were involved in a project of analysis of energy performance of UPC buildings in order to identify and implement cost-effective ways of promoting a greater environmental responsibility. The development of works focused the attention on introducing energy audits in existing university buildings, analysing the following aspects: surveying construction drawings, building characteristics, energy consumption, use of natural lighting, energy-saving lighting controls, water consumption, and high-efficiency HVAC systems. The ultimate goal was to draft a proposal for greater respect for the environment, and for corrective measures aimed at reducing the environmental impacts. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The trail to sustainability requires a revolution on the way environmental professionals perceive and solve environmental problems. In a globalisation context, environmental professionals have to develop new personal, interpersonal, societal and technical skills to become active throughout their professional lives and to be of value in the quest for sustainability. Professionals have to develop open mindsets, a holistic perspective of the problems and integrated solutions. Current environmental engineer courses fail to provide the required skills, due to the traditional higher education structure. The role of implementation of an Environmental Management System on campus, in providing students with the 'hands-on', 'on-the-job' business skills that will make them useful in the search for sustainability is discussed.

SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
LA English
DT Article
DE sustainable development education; engineering schools; e-mail cost
AB This paper evaluates the economic and environmental costs of sending an e-mail from home. Because e-mail is an indispensable tool for almost everyone today, its price is compared with the price of a stamp for snail mail. However, the price of sending an e-mail is hidden within telecommunication infrastructures. Although e-mail has a real economic and environmental cost, the absence of this real cost leads us to overproduce e-mails. Despite the fact that we pay flat rates, there are time windows that pollute less. In some cases, the cost of the infrastructure is lower than the cost of its exploitation, and ADSL is the least cost-effective according to the prices in Spain. A final reflection is that a single e-mail is very cheap but thousands of apparently free e-mails are expensive. If our students, the most intensive e-mail users, learn about its environmental costs, they may be persuaded to adopt Sustainable Development Education. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The Master Gardener (MG) program, found throughout the United States and Canada, originated in Washington State to provide high-quality, research-based, educational programming to the gardening public. Washington State MGs are trained by Washington State University (WSU) faculty and other specialists in applied plant and soil sciences. After completing this intensive program, MG trainees must pass subject matter exams and then begin their volunteer activities.
   Today, over 4000 active WSU MG volunteers provide horticultural assistance to their communities. While MGs increase their scientific knowledge, they also develop communication, management, and leadership skills. With sufficient support from local educational institutions and government, this program can easily be adapted to any community in any country where environmental sustainability is desired.

AB The integration of university and society for social development and environmental management is founded in adequate interrelations of local stakeholders' problems with natural resource conservation problems. The university's main mission is actively integrating teaching, research and extension activities in order to provide professionals with knowledge and skills that contribute to social development of their community. The most effective means to achieve sustainable development is the integration of local knowledge and problems with scientific knowledge generated through research and development. This paper focuses on a case study of conservation of the Ayuquila River watershed as an example of successfully integrating universities in the regional society and presents the experience of researchers from the Manantlan Institute of Ecology and Conservation of Biodiversity of the University of Guadalajara, Mexico, and their interrelation with the Biosphere Reserve Sierra de Manantlan, an undergraduate education environmental-related program and the development of basic and applied research for strengthening social development and natural resource conservation of the Sierra de Manantlan region. The Ayuquila watershed case study is specifically presented, but we also discuss the associated problems. Relevant, long-term research, local involvement and social participation had been some of the key issues for the Manantlan Institute to contribute to the sustainable development of the Sierra de Manantlan region.

DE Environmental Management and Reporting System; households; small to

AB Households have many similarities to small and medium-sized enterprises. They have inputs and outputs, produce services and wastes, have cash flows and related budgeting issues and incorporate a range of management functions. Households also cover the full suite of Triple Bottom Line aspects, i.e., social, environmental and economic. For tertiary education purposes the household has been a focus at Lincoln University for environmental management students to study environmental management systems and sustainability reporting. This paper outlines the educational aims and context for the course of study and demonstrates, through the examination of one student's course work, how there are similarities between SMEs and households and the sort of initiative designed for a household that also might work in SMEs. As part of this demonstration the paper introduces the Awareness, Action and Advancement (AAA) Environmental Management and Reporting System. The AAA system is cyclic, straightforward, marketable and appears to work. As such the principles from this educational exercise might have relevance in SMEs. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Sustainability in Mexican Higher Education: towards a new academic and
   professional culture
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
LA English
DT Article
DE higher education in Mexico; sustainability; Decade of Education for
   Sustainable Development
AB This article focuses on institutions of higher education and the introduction of sustainability in the curricula of these institutions. It states that a very important part of developing new curricula is the focus on a new academic and professional culture. The key argument is as follows. Normally institutions of higher education build upon the training that students received in previous phases of education. That is why institutions of higher education can focus on education in highly specific and specialized knowledge and skills. Education for sustainability, however, cannot follow this 'normal' pathway because much of what students learned in their previous education does not fit into the paradigm of sustainability. That is why sustainability education should include a partial 're-education' and 're-programming' of students. The article presents a framework for such a new academic and professional culture focussing on sustainability. It shows how this framework is developed within the Universidad Autonoma Metropolitana, Unidad Azcapotzalco (UAM-A) in Mexico. The article also shows how the development of this framework is embedded in various initiatives on a national and international level. First of all the framework is developed as part of the design and implementation of an environmental plan for the whole university. The making of this plan is encouraged by the Mexican National Association of Universities and Higher Educations Institutions. Since the year 2002 this Association stimulates all major universities in Mexico to develop and implement such an environmental plan. These activities on their turn fit very well into the "United Nations Decade of Education for Sustainable Development" that started in January 2005. Finally the article presents the first promising results of the new course "The environmental challenges" that is based on many elements of the framework. It was started in 2005 in the Division of Basic Sciences and Engineering of UAM-Azcapotzalco, Mexico. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI A project-based Mine Closure Model (MCM) for sustainable asset Life
   Cycle Management
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
LA English
DT Article
DE Life Cycle Management; asset management; project management; mine
   closure; rehabilitation
AB Responsible Life Cycle Management (LCM) of mines has received much attention in the South African legislation. However, there is currently a mis-alignment between the mining industry and the various government authorities pertaining to the issue of mine closure or end-of-life management. The main reasons for this are unclear and unformulated approaches to rehabilitation with a subsequent legacy of unsuccessful mine closures that have wrongly been issued by the government from a sustainability perspective; this has posed an excessive economical burden for the mining industry. In this paper, a Mine Closure Model (MCM) based on project management principles, including risk management and concurrent engineering, is proposed to manage the closure process and assist the governing body with the effective evaluation of closures and the issuance of certificates. Mine closure or rehabilitation objectives can be achieved whilst managing the resources (of industry) optimally and aligning the closure process to meet the end requirements of stakeholder groups.

DT Article
DE mining; environmental management; life cycle assessment; sustainability
AB Mexico ranks among the I I major producer countries of minerals worldwide; its open pit and underground systems arc 500 years old. This paper presents an overview of the Mexican mining industry from technological development, historical and economic perspectives. The efforts made by mining companies to address issues or environmental management and sustainable development expressed in national and international frameworks, as well as the Mexican environmental regulatory framework for the mining sector, are analyzed. Since, among others, life cycle assessment (LCA) has been recognized as a key topic to promote sustainable development in the Latin American and Caribbean region, this paper also examines the application of LCA in mining. Two life cycle approaches are presented: a national life cycle inventory for base metals, and an integral life cycle model for the management of mining processes. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The article provides definitions for environmental accounting and environmental management accounting based on the approach developed for the United Nations Division of Sustainable Development UN DSD/DESA. It presents the basic framework for assessing corporate environmental costs as well as materials flows (including energy and water) and their costs. The paper is based on experiences from applying the UN DSD EMA framework in company workshops and case studies mainly in Austria. It especially describes how to check for data consistency within different information systems, like the list of accounts, stock management, production planning and process engineering. Common hurdles for obtaining data from different information systems are described and solutions for improved consistency of data in an organization are presented. It provides a detailed example of an assessment in a brewery in the excel tool developed to assist in the application of the UN DSD EMA approach. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

DE environmental management accounting; sustainability management
   accounting; sustainability accounting; environmental costs; health and
   safety costs; external costs; intangible items; automobile industry
AB The paper is based on a project with the Styrian automobile cluster in Austria and selected member companies. In six companies, the environmental management costs, as well as further costs for health and safety, risk management and other social issues were assessed. Less tangible items and external effects are addressed. Starting with the efforts to assess the financial effects of the sustainability performance indicators provided by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) for sustainability reporting, the UN DSD (United Nations Division for Sustainable Development) method for environmental management accounting (EMA) was enlarged by several other cost categories. This paper describes these and the experiences from the pilot projects.
   The two major cost drivers are the purchase costs of non-product output and the costs related to lost working days because of sick leave and accidents and the overtime pay to make up for these lost working days. The work of the Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) department helps to reduce these costs. The cost assessment scheme allows one to better understand the relationships between costs for treatment of undesired effects due to unimplemented protection measures and lost material purchase value in comparison to the prevention costs, which mainly consist of the internal management departments and related external consultants.
   The assessment of sustainability management costs is of interest for organisations, which already publish a sustainability report and want to more accurately assess the financial effects of such aspects addressed via EMA. It is also useful for small and medium sized companies, which use the assessment as a starting point to shape their (EHS) system. The main benefits are more accurate data and better arguments for investment appraisal or performance indicators as well as improved consistency of information and management systems that should help them to improve their environmental, social and economic performance.

TI Environmental management accounting as a reflexive modernization
   strategy in cleaner production
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
LA English
DT Article
DE environmental management accounting; cleaner production; corporate
   sustainability; reflexive modernization; reflexive corporations
AB Understanding the material purchase value of wastes and emissions and related processing costs is the essential contribution of an Environmental Management Accounting methodology proposed by a United Nations expert working group organised through the Division for Sustainable Development (UNDSD). Tracing costs and benefits according to this UNDSD methodology, considered as a "reflexive" modernization strategy in this article, sheds new light on cleaner production initiatives for corporate sustainability. Information on the first category of costs, waste and emission treatment, is generally the most accurate. Information on the second category, prevention and environmental management costs, is more difficult to determine because this category overlaps with, or is confused with, the first category of costs. Data for the two novel and innovative cost categories of the material purchase value of waste and emissions and related processing costs are even harder to obtain. Frequently, the costs are either hidden in overhead accounts or are not recorded because they are not required in conventional accounting systems. The outcome is that companies, even though they may profess otherwise, have very little knowledge about their full environmental costs, cost saving opportunities, or how best to achieve cleaner production initiatives to promote corporate sustainability. A more systematic application of the UNDSD EMA methodology would provide a better record of costs and act as a catalyst in promoting cleaner production processes. This application inevitably requires "reflexive institutions" including "reflexive corporations", that is, corporations with the capacity to examine the side effects of their operations as modernization rebounds upon them.

TI Environmental management accounting in Lithuania: exploratory study of
   current practices, opportunities and strategic intents
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
LA English
DT Article
DE cleaner production financing; environmental management accounting;
   material and energy flow balance; environmental performance
AB There is a growing consensus among the Lithuanian policy makers, practitioners and industrialists that environmental policy must move from a reactive stance to a more proactive, sustainable development approach. As a result, many companies are increasingly interested in the application of economic incentives at least as supplements or reinforcements of environmental standards.
   The Institute of Environmental Engineering (EU Centre of Excellence in Sustainable Industrial Development (APINI - SID)) in 1992-2003 has been involved in introduction and implementation of preventive environmental strategy in industry in Lithuania and in other countries. In Lithuania, these efforts resulted in the implementation of more than 200 cleaner production innovations in more than 150 Lithuanian companies. It should be stressed that effective plant maintenance is becoming a higher priority to plant managers. It is important to ensure cost-savings, at all levels, that include maximizing productivity and implementing energy-saving approaches. Effective and efficient maintenance are not just desirable, but fundamental to profitable business operations. Therefore, central to the environmental view of sustainable development is the concept that economic and social systems are sub-systems of the global environment.
   APINI's experience shows that decision-makers at the company level often fail to recognize the economic values of natural resources as assets as well as the business and financial value of good environmental performance. Therefore, there is a need to upgrade the business decision-making process by including information on material flows and related costs to account for efforts of sustainable development [Staniskis JK, Stasiskiene Z. Promotion of cleaner production investments: international experience. Journal of Cleaner Production 2002; 11(6):619-28. ISSN: 0959-6526, Elsevier Science]. Decisions are increasingly affected by environmental costs. Application of environmental management accounting (EMA), which integrates two of the main principles of sustainable development - environment and economics, can help to significantly improve corporate decision-making.
   EMA is becoming increasingly important not only for environmental management decisions and development of environmental management systems (EMS), but also for all types of routine management activities, such as product and process design, cost allocation and control, capital budgeting, purchasing, product pricing and performance evaluation.
   Companies, which use EMA as a part of integrated management system, are provided with accurate and comprehensive information for the measurement and reporting of environmental performance.
   This paper investigates the current state of EMA practices in Lithuanian SMEs that have already been or are being implementing EMS and which have implemented CP innovations. In this case, EMA is analysed as an innovative assessment and evaluation method of EMS and CP innovation's environmental impacts and economic benefits. It should be stressed, that there are obvious differences in case studies from different industries. However, review of the results shows that there are many similarities in what improvements can be suggested for environmentally concerned companies both in terms of environmentally sound operation and for reporting of environmental management accounting information.

AB This paper explores the links between environmental management accounting and measures of eco-efficiency in Japanese business. Environmental management accounting is a relatively new environmental management tool initially designed to trace and track environmental costs and physical environmental flows. In the paper, first, the recent development of environmental management accounting is considered; second, the links between environmental management accounting and eco-efficiency measurement are examined. Recent case studies in environmental management accounting from Japan are used as a basis for the analysis. It is concluded from the analysis that the practice of linking eco-efficiency measurement with environmental management accounting information is underutilised, diverse and in need of further promotion if EMA is to help Japanese business move production processes and consumption of its products towards sustainability.

TI Challenges in internal environmental management reporting in Argentina
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
LA English
DT Article
DE cleaner production; EMA; accounting; information; BSC; reporting
AB This paper concentrates on the internal reporting methods applied to cleaner production and environmental management accounting programmes in Argentina. Questions on how environmental costs and benefits are defined, the mechanisms adopted to measure the continuing benefits arising from certain changes in management and processes and practical issues of data collection and collation are included. Furthermore, situations in which the ideally desired information is not immediately available from existing accounting or other information systems within the companies are also discussed. The success of communication initiatives, in particular, rests on both the environmental accounting messages and the ability of the users to understand the information. From this perspective, the worksheets included are considered to be an important tool to following the programmes and communicating the results. The integration of data through a set of indicators organised according to an environmentally balanced scorecard methodology may provide important information for decision-makers and add real value to sustainable development by helping people become conscious of sustainability-related matters. In addition, accountants need to know about the information improvements they can obtain using the EMA methodology. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This article discusses how and when product lifetime optimization of consumer goods can be a challenging strategy towards more sustainable consumption. First, the environmental desirability of longer lasting products is discussed. This leads to the introduction of the ecological payback period, a simple rule of thumb to determine when product lifetime extension is environmentally sound. The effectiveness of extending the product lifetime depends, however, on the replacement motives of consumers. Based on qualitative and quantitative consumer research, a typology of four general replacement motives is presented: wear and tear, improved utility, improved expression and new desires.

Typical consulting activities are: Life Cycle Assessment; handbook for LCD and eco-efficient product, service and product-service system development; procedure and tools to integrate environmental requirements into company existing product, service and product-service system development process; courses on LCD), resulting in such tools, currently integrated into the company product development process. The considerations are based upon on primary data and experiences.
   The final results of this project are two handbooks of guidelines and checklists for the eco-efficient development of two types of vending machines: one for Snack & Food (spirals model), the other for Hot & Cold drinks.
   In order to achieve these results an LCA has been developed and a system to prioritize guidelines has been adopted; this system has led to a procedure which moves from general to specific guidelines and checklist. Finally these tools have been integrated within the company procedure.
   The method adopted by DIS in this applied research is described, highlighting the observed key success factors in a project between a University research unit and a company.
   Final considerations expand upon the matured experiences to demonstrate the importance and efficacy to go from general methods and tools to more specific ones (e.g. specific guidelines and checklist), in order to implement Life Cycle Design principles, in the real company practices and culture.

AB Lucent Technologies (Lucent) has undergone considerable change in business strategy with the outsourcing of manufacturing activities. In order to control the significant environmental aspects of hardware products, Lucent's wireless business unit, Mobility Solutions, determined it would concentrate on the design of products: focusing on eco-design enables product sustainability to be improved, with each product generation providing a 'start of pipe' (front end) solution with attendant efficiencies.
   Mobility Solutions pioneered a product-based environmental management system (PBEMS) to formally address the impacts of wireless hardware products on the environment throughout the entire product lifecycle, regardless of where products are developed. This management system looks beyond the environmental impacts of manufacturing to include conceptual design, development, use by the customer, and final product disposal.
   The success of this approach can be attributed to the integration of eco-design with traditional hardware product realization processes. Through the PBEMS, business and environmental processes are simultaneously utilized to manage significant product aspects and to incorporate sustainability principles during product design. Many innovative eco-design tools are applied during the product realization process to identify areas for improvement of future products, and to verify that each generation of existing products is more sustainable than its predecessor. These eco-design tools include eco-roadmapping, design for environment guidelines and checklists, and lifecycle assessments.
   The Mobility Solutions PBEMS conforms to the requirements of the ISO 14001 international standard and has achieved third-party certification. By implementing environmentally responsible characteristics through eco-design programs, employees, customers, and the world community benefit from a consistent approach to the environmental management of wireless hardware products. Mobility Solutions continues to reap the value of sustainable product design that is both good for the environment and makes sound business sense. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This article describes how ABB worked with environmental considerations when they developed their new capacitor. The sustainable development priorities are now integrated within their mainstream product development process model. The fact that ABB started a mandatory use of their GATE Model, including the sustainability considerations, verifies that ABB considers it to be a commercially sound methodology. The studied project resulted in a product with considerably better environmental performance than the traditional technology. One key factor is that the sustainability interest was truly advocated and supported by the management of the project. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI EcoDesign and The Ten Golden Rules: generic advice for merging
   environmental aspects into product development
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
LA English
DT Article
DE ecodesign; design for the environment; product development; design
AB The most important moment in product development is when demands and specifications are decided for the product that is being planned. The specification defines the goal for the product development process. It is a very important steering opportunity for the continuing work and for environmentally driven demands that are to be addressed in the product development phase. The designers are said to have the key to sustainable product development through EcoDesign. Many tools have been developed in order to help them to achieve this objective. However, most tools are seldom used primarily because of a lack of sustainability oriented requirements in specifications for products. If there is no demand for improved environmental performance, then there is no need for EcoDesign tools. The lack of market demand for environmentally improved products is therefore, a crucial factor. In other words: It makes no sense to grab a screwdriver from your toolbox if you have a nail in your hand. On the other hand if you have a hammer in your hand you tend to see everything as nails! The hypothesis of this paper is that there is a strong need for a tool to facilitate the integration of reasonable environmental demands into the product development process. The presented tool, "The Ten Golden Rules," can be helpful in this effort. A helpful tool must be well adapted to the task and therefore it is important that the individual product developer/designer can develop personal versions from the generic guidelines. The Ten Golden Rules provide such a possibility. They provide a common foundation, for all in the team, which can be used as a base and guidelines for development of situation specific product-design challenges. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

DE ecodesign tools; trade-off; product development; purchasing;
   procurement; sustainability; sustainable development
AB Trade-off situations often occur in the product development and procurement processes when alternative solutions emphasize different aspects that have to be balanced against each other. Ecodesign tools can be used in both product development and purchasing, for example to prescribe design alternatives, assess environmental impacts or to compare environmental improvement alternatives. However, it is not always clear what should be chosen in trade-off situations. In this study, 15 different Ecodesign tools were analyzed to ascertain whether a valuation is included in the tools, in what way the tools give support in different types of trade-off situations and whether the tools provide support from a sustainability perspective.
   Nine of the 15 tools analyzed included a valuation and were able to provide support in a trade-off situation, but the support was not sufficient. The valuation should include a life cycle perspective and a framework for sustainability. Otherwise, it can lead to strategically incorrect decisions from a sustainability perspective with concomitant risks of sub-optimized investment paths and blind alleys. However, all the analyzed tools can be complemented with other tools and methods based on strategic planning towards sustainability in order to include a framework for sustainability.

AB The paper presents details about a doctoral-level EcoDesign course, as an education for sustainable development experience, in relation to pedagogic theory. The aim was to promote transformative learning in order to facilitate more productive use of environmental knowledge in product and business development. The course included interdisciplinary dialogue founded in real world experiences presented by lecturers from business, government and NGOs, as well as study visits and group work on the drafting of journal papers. The key pedagogical objective was to widen the perspective to embrace more humanly engaging concerns and to enhance the student's overall understanding about relations between sustainable development priorities and product design practices. @ 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In 2001 the CEOs from DuPont, Chad Holliday, and from Procter & Gamble, John Pepper, published a report entitled Sustainability through the Market: Seven Keys to Success. This publication made the business case for meeting the needs of burgeoning populations for goods and services while protecting the natural environment at the same time. Further hundreds of millions are working their way out of poverty and demanding more goods and services. This paper highlights business efforts to meet these demands in a sustainable manner by leveraging market frameworks. This is the essence of the sustainable development argument first posited by Gro Harlem Brundtland in 1987 in the landmark book, Our Common Future. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION

AB The servicisation of many advanced economies is thought by many commentators to provide opportunities to move society away from unsustainable patterns of production and consumption. The concept of the Product Service System (PSS) has been conceptualised in academic circles to assist in the attainment of such desirable futures. This paper reports the findings of research conducted as part of the SOLiD project which considered the transfer and application of the PSS concept from academia to industry in the United Kingdom. It draws upon theories from evolutionary economics to provide a rationale for the transfer of the PSS concept and the role of this in achieving desirable technological change. The paper also identifies an appropriate methodology to transfer the PSS concept from UK academic circles to industry and the factors which impact upon, and importantly lead to, the successful completion of this process. The combination of theoretical insight with case study research is used to develop a framework that could help UK based intermediaries to complete the transfer of the PSS concept. This is seen as an integral part of public policies aimed at stimulating sustainable patterns of production and consumption. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The Sustainable Product and/or Service Development (SPSD) approach is a pragmatic industry support encompassing a range of strategies aimed at maximising environmental and social performance in all types of "offerings" whether they are "products", "services" or Product Service Systems (PSS). Implementation of the approach was tested in industry and conclusions reached on the effectiveness of the strategies included in terms of developing an offering with improved sustainability performance as well as practical use as an industry approach. Two strategies incorporated are functional and systems thinking, as these are seen as key for increasing the environmental benefits of offerings. This paper summarises the SPSD approach, general industry testing results, describes how and why functional and systems strategies are incorporated in it and industry testing results relating to their use. This provides valuable information on how functional and systems related considerations can be practically and effectively included in sustainable offering development. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

ID CONSUMPTION PATTERNS; INDICATORS; LIFE
AB In this article we evaluate over 200 European household services in seven service areas related to household consumption. Services were chosen that contribute to at least two of the three dimensions of sustainable development: environment, social aspects, and economy. The analysed services are called sustainable home services indicating that they are provided to the customers directly at home or on the premises, and that they enhance sustainable development. It appears that the social effects of the assessed services are larger than their environmental and economic benefits. This is presumably at least partly due to the fact that in order to survive in the market, household services must first and foremost be socially beneficial to the users, in other words, improve the quality of life of consumers.

AB Rethinking the role consumption plays in individual well-being and societal development is key for addressing pressing environmental problems. We perceive the need to envision consumption as a social activity, which requires the active engagement of consumers in order to better enhance their quality of life. The paper focuses on the framework of Product Service Systems, one particular programme for more sustainable consumption. After reviewing the potential benefits and limitations of this programme, we explore the opportunities to learn from participatory and community-based strategies like LETS. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In the last decade many researchers, institutes and programs in the EU paid attention to product-service systems (PSS). Given this massive effort, it is time to take stock. Is PSS research a theoretical field in its own right? Is the PSS concept indeed the road to the Factor 10 world? Is it the road to enhanced competitiveness? What is needed to really use the potential of the concept? This paper discusses these questions summarizing the analysis done in the PSS review book 'New Business for Old Europe', various EU sponsored projects and the conceptual approach chosen in a new research network on Sustainable Consumption and Production, called SCORE!

AB The analysis of the Cleaner Production (CP)/pollution prevention concept application in Lithuanian companies demonstrates a number of opportunities in waste minimization and pollution prevention areas aimed at sustainable development.
   To compare the efficiency of various CP methods and to identify the preventive methods with the highest energy saving possibilities in different Lithuanian sectors of the economy the database "The implementation of Cleaner Production in Lithuania" was used. This database was developed in line with CP implementation methodology and contains technical, environmental, economic and financial information on implemented CP innovations in Lithuanian companies during the last decade. In addition, several applicable CP innovations are described in case studies. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Despite the promotion of Cleaner Production (CP) by government, academia and research institutions in the past few years, only a small number of Vietnamese industries have adopted it. This paper explores why CP has not been widely adopted by industry through an examination of the root causes preventing effective CP implementation in Vietnam. The paper concludes with possible directions for improving the effectiveness and sustainability of CP programs in Vietnam through training and education. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Water integration studies have focused on reducing the amount of water used by a process on the assumption that environmental impact is reduced through efficient water reuse. However, the environmental impact of retrofitting the water network through the installation of pumps and pipes and energy for their utilization which may even lead to a network with a higher environmental cost as measured using a more comprehensive metric, is rarely, if at all, considered. Using the Sustainable Process Index (SPI) as a means of measuring environmental impact, this study addresses the question on water integration and environmental impact and shows that there is a balance that must be struck between water savings and water network modifications.

AB In this paper we deal with the problem of identifying environmental principles for the design and operation of supply chains. The operations that are included in supply chains are briefly described along with the approaches that are applied in order to improve their environmental performance. A background of environmental principles for achieving eco-efficiency and building of environmentally friendly organizational systems is presented and emphasis is put on the application of such principles "from cradle to grave". Then, environmental principles applicable to particular objects of logistics networks planning are identified and commented upon. In addition, selective case studies from the literature, which show the applicability of the formulated principles and their relevance to practice, are discussed. The paper concludes with some remarks regarding the benefits for companies and societies, in general, that occur as a result of the application of the formulated principles. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Regional eco-efficiency indicators - a participatory approach
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
LA English
DT Article
DE eco-efficiency; sustainability; indicator; region
AB Eco-efficiency emerged in the 1990s as a measure of "the efficiency with which ecological resources are used to meet human needs." Eco-efficiency indicators as tools for regional sustainability policy were demonstrated in a Life-Environment project, ECOREG, in the Finnish region of Kymenlaakso. A participatory approach was utilised to produce indicators that are relevant for regional decision-makers and that will actually be used. The approach established a system through which decision-makers are able to monitor changes using several economic-environmental ratio indicators, and at the same time obtain information on the social progress taking place in the region. In the future, there will be a need for an ongoing dialogue among the different actors in the region in order to ensure that the indicators are indeed used to promote sustainable development.

DT Article
DE free trade agreements; foreign investment; labour; Mexico; NAFTA;
   Southeast Asia; United States-Thailand relations
AB This article shows how free trade agreements (FTAs) in Southeast Asia are essentially a means to secure foreign direct investment (17131) at the expense of the working class. It explores the significance of FDI in export-oriented industrialisation and for economic transformation in Southeast Asia, with emphasis on the increasing global competition for FDI. As negotiations at the World Trade Organization are uncertain, an intricate web of bilateral and regional FTAs h as arisen over the past decade as states and business seek to revitalize competitiveness. These FTAs have a high potential for negative effects on workers, particularly in labour-intensive industries. This is best exemplified by Mexico's ten-year experience with NAFTA The Thailand-US FTA negotiatibns are a case study indicating that FTAs are more compatible with authoritarian labour control, increasing poverty, job displacement, and weakening of the development process than with sustainable development.

AB The multidisciplinary EC VIDRIO project has the purpose of providing a better understanding of the effect of the environment on glass surfaces and paint (grisaille) and to evaluate the efficiency of the protective glazing system, in order to find sustainable solutions to protect ancient stained glass windows from the main causes of glass weathering, in particular the condensation phenomenon. Hence, a new device, named "dew point sensor", was built and patented to protect the stained glass windows by detecting the condensation on the glass surface. The research was focused on laboratory tests and experimental campaigns: two important French monuments, Sainte-Chapelle in Paris and Saint-Urbain Basilica in Troyes, were monitored, while the study in Cologne Cathedral (Germany) is still in progress. Three different systems were used to detect the phenomenon of condensation in order to evaluate and compare their accuracy and reliability: the indirect measurement through mathematic calculations using air temperature and relative humidity, and two direct measurements by means of the dew point and the leaf wetness sensors, The laboratory tests and research in the field made evident the errors associated with the measurements of the condensation process, and the accuracy and reliability of the new device. The efficiency of the protective glazing system, as regards to the weathering of the stained glass windows, has been confirmed. In fact, the presence of a protective glazing reduces the danger of condensation on the internal side of the ancient window and also the total time of the high relative humidity values of the air in contact with the protected window.

AB Mankind needs to use the resources and opportunities offered by the marine environment while protecting ecological processes and systems. This is the foundation for sustainable development, which can only be achieved by adopting an appropriate management approach. Whether internationally or at a regional scale, successful management of marine ecosystems needs to be based on a scientifically robust approach to monitoring environmental change. Within such a framework, the conservation of marine biological diversity is problematic, as many conventional measures of diversity are not appropriate for measuring the types of change that require management. New indicators are required and in this paper we summarise some of the current methodology being used to derive such indices, which may be used to evaluate the effectiveness of marine stewardship initiatives. Through a series of examples we demonstrate the application of the taxonomic distinctness indicator of biodiversity to marine environmental assessment and its development towards becoming an operational tool.

AB The modem environmental management literature stresses the need for community involvement to identify indicators to monitor progress towards sustainable development and environmental management goals. The purpose of this paper is to assess the impact of participatory processes on sustainability indicator identification and environmental management in three disparate case studies. The first is a process of developing partnerships between First Nations communities, environmental groups, and forestry companies to resolve conflicts over forest management in Western Canada. The second describes a situation in Botswana where local pastoral communities worked with development researchers to reduce desertification. The third case study details an on-going government led process of developing sustainability indicators in Guernsey, UK, that was designed to monitor the environmental, social, and economic impacts of changes in the economy. The comparative assessment between case studies allows us to draw three primary conclusions. (1) The identification and collection of sustainability indicators not only provide valuable databases for making management decisions, but the process of engaging people to select indicators also provides an opportunity for community empowerment that conventional development approaches have failed to provide. (2) Multi-stakeholder processes must formally feed into decision-making forums or they risk being viewed as irrelevant by policy-makers and stakeholders. (3) Since ecological boundaries rarely meet up with political jurisdictions, it is necessary to be flexible when choosing the scale at which monitoring and decision-making occurs. This requires an awareness of major environmental pathways that run through landscapes to understand how seemingly remote areas may be connected in ways that are not immediately apparent.

AB The natural and anthropogenic, both continental and marine pressure, due to the geographical position and anthropogenic impact, like hydrotechnical works (road, railway, building works and consolidation, freshening) industrial pollution (chemical agents, detergents, pesticides), waste water products and deposits; agricultural (crops fertilising, private vegetable gardens, zootechnique activities), tourism, (recreation, sailing, nautical sports, seasonal bathing areas), use of therapeutical sludge, overexploitation of natural resources (mainly fish production) have had a big influence on the present ecological statement of the inland water at the Romanian Black sea coast. Adding to these causes, the wrong applying or the lack of environment legislation control it is easy to explain the human impact consequences in the area of coastal inland waters. Samples of water and sediments have been collected from natural lakes net belonging to the Danube delta, central and southern coastal zone (Tasaul, Corbu, Siutghiol, Tabacarie, Agigea, Techirghiol, Costinesti, Tatlageac, Limanu, Mangalia), a swamp Herghelia, and a lagoon Sinoe. The stations were settled on important anthropogenic impact points or on connection places between border areas of interest, as well as between important areas from the point of view of the system, sources, objectives, breaks through important points. The results obtained in Tasaul, Siutghiol, Techirghiol lakes and Sinoe lagoon can be compared with the former years hydrochemical and hydrobiological analyses. The other inland waters have been assessed after more than 15 years of research gaps. Results obtained assessing the ecological statement of coastal inland waters, realised under the NIMRD 'G. Antipa' Constantza and NIMR 'Danube Delta' Tulcea coordination, stress the necessity to take urgent measures of rehabilitation for water) quality and natural resources of coastal inland areas with a huge social and economical importance. Solutions proposed for ecological recovery, according to the European legislation concerning the environment protection, conservation and use, have as the target sustainable development in the coastal zone and human health maintaining improvement.
