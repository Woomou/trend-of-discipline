ID SUSTAINABILITY
AB This paper deals with the application of emergy analysis to systems with co-productions. Emergy is a measure of how much work the biosphere has done in order to provide a product, in terms of solar energy joules. For this reason, especially by means of the emergy-based indices, emergy analysis is a one of the key functions for assessing sustainability. However the application of emergy analysis to processes with co-production can be misleading. Usually some inputs have to be added in order to obtain a 'useful' product from a by-product. This would lead to penalizing a co-production with respect to two (or more) independent processes, since the fact of having another output is neglected in calculations. To have a better comparison, we introduce the concept of joint transformity and the weighted average of the transformities. The same reasoning is applied to other emergy-based indices. These new indexes should be added to the set of the existing ones to enlarge the possibilities of application. A case study of a dairy farm in Puerto Rico was analyzed from this viewpoint, showing that co-production of milk and methane (or electricity) is more efficient and less impacting on the environment with respect to separate productions, while two separate processes would be more effective in using local resources.

AB Water repellence is a serious land degradation issue and a constraint to productivity on approximately two million hectares across South Australia. Sandy soils that have poor coverage of pasture and crops lend themselves to the risk of wind erosion and loss of yields. A technique that has once seen highly unproductive pasture country now producing crops is 'clay spreading'. As with many discoveries, the ability of clay to counteract the effects of water repellent sand was unearthed by accident thirty years ago by Clem Obst, farmer at Mundulla, SE of South Australia. Today, approximately 37,000 ha of land in South Australia has been clay spread, of which 32,000 ha is in the SE of South Australia. The application of clay to water repellent sand increases the effectiveness of pre-emergent herbicides, amelioration of water repellency, improves the germination, establishment and yields of pasture plants and crops and nutrient and moisture retention in the topsoil. Water repellent sand pastures generally contain little, if any, legume content and produce as little as 400 kg/ha dry matter compared to clayed pastures (3250 kg/ha) which are sub-clover or lucerne based. Spreading clay has generally doubled cropping yields. The technique of clay spreading is continually being modified to enable landholders to attain maximum economic returns while ensuring the long-term sustainability of agriculture on water repellent sands.

ID SOIL
AB The three most westerly states of southern Australia have the largest area of water repellent soils, which limit agricultural production, of any country in the world.
   Simplified principles of the problems caused by repellency and the principles of soil management solutions are considered and related to experimental evidence. The phenomena of diverted soil water flow and isolated dry soil can explain most of the problems caused by repellency. Plant adaptation, soil or hydrophobic removal, reduced soil drying, reduced surface tension, water harvesting, avoidance, masking and, perhaps, water movement along dead root systems are the main soil management principles.
   Dead roots may play a role in zero till cropping systems, allowing more uniform wetting of dry hydrophobic soil at the base of a dead plant and along the dendritic pattern of the dead root system.
   Application of these management principles, especially water harvesting, avoidance and masking (by the use of deep trenching, furrow sowing methods or claying), have made a considerable improvement to sustainability and productivity of farming systems on the water repellent soils of Australia.
   Evidence is selected to assess risks of preferential flow, pesticide concentration and leaching for different agricultural soil management methods. All management methods can have some risks, but claying seems to have the least risk and furrowing the highest risk of encouraging preferential flow, pesticide concentration and leaching.
   It is suggested we have insufficient information and understanding to quantify the risks of groundwater contamination for different environments, farming systems and soil management methods to control repellency.
   There is an urgent need to develop quantified guidelines to minimise any possible groundwater contamination hazard for the extensive areas using farming systems with furrows and increasing amounts of pesticide and fertiliser. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Browse and cereal stubble represent the two most important resources for grazing small ruminants in dry Mediterranean areas. The purpose of the present review is to provide updated information regarding their nutritional value. In a mixed Mediterranean environment? browse represents at least 40% of goat's diet. Most browse species in the Mediterranean are rich in tanniferous phenolic substances. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) can bind tannins irreversibly over a wide range of pH and is efficient in alleviating the negative effects of tannins. Supplementing with PEG improves intake and digestibility in grazing goats and sheep and has the potential to be economically profitable. The chemical composition of wheat stubble is affected by the cultivar of wheat and climate, but not tillage management. The quality of stubble from early maturing is lower than from late maturing cultivars. Stubble contains more protein in years of lower rainfall. If grains escaped from the harvest combine (2% of grain yield) are included, digestibility of OM from different components ranges between +/-80% (grain) to +/-40% (stem). Also, the energy requirement of sheep grazing on stubble may be 70% higher than in shaded feedlot. Therefore, the body condition changes of sheep grazing on stubble exhibit a cyclic pattern consequent with temporal changes in nutritive quality. Because stubble grazing is concurrent with the onset of oestrous season, supplementation with grains from legume species-rich in degradable protein-is needed to prevent impairment of body condition. Supplementing browsing goats with PEG, and sheep grazing cereal stubble with moderate amounts of legume grain, may enable the use of these traditional resources in the frame of sustainable production systems.

AB Dams and particularly large dams, are required to meet the increasing demand for water, foodgrains, flood control, supply of power, particularly peaking power, and supply of carbon-free energy. However, there are apprehensions about the effects of hydel projects, especially large dams on ecology and society, and displacement of people. We need to balance current needs with long-term sustainable development. This article analyses the various options on the basis of data available.

AB In the semi-arid part of northern Tanzania, the native tropical woodland is undergoing a rapid conversion into agricultural land. This has resulted in drastic ecological changes in the region. This study was undertaken to investigate the effects of these changes in land use systems on the amount and composition of SOM in bulk soil samples and size separates. Samples were collected from the upper 10cm of a native tropical woodland, a degraded woodland, 3 and 15 years cultivated fields and home-stead fields where animal manure was regularly applied. Carbon, N, lignin derived phenols and non-celulosic carbohydrates were determined in the samples. Clearing and cultivation of the tropical woodland resulted in a decline of SOM contents in bulk soils and in all size separates. A 56% reduction of C and a 51% reduction of N contents were observed in bulk soils of the cultivated fields. A rapid decline in C and N in coarse and fine sand fractions occurred during the first 3 years of cultivation The reduction of stable SOM, i.e., the SOM which was in intimate association with the silt and clay sized fractions was relatively small. These results show the importance of organo-mineral associations in stabilization of SOM in soils of the semi-arid tropics. However, a more pronounced decline of stable SOM, especially from the clay, was observed in the 15 years than in the 3 years cultivated fields. These indicate that SOM losses due to cultivation of the native soil may not level off in the near feature. A decline in labile fractions of SOM was found in soils of the degraded woodland. Application of manure increased SOM in bulk soil and in the stabile fractions. An increasing degree of SOM humification with decreasing particle size separates was indicated by C/N ratios and by lignin and carbohydrate signatures. The carbohydrate signatures indicated a direct input of fresh plant residue into the mineral soils of the cultivated fields compared to the native woodland. Therefore, there is a need to develop sustainable soil management and cropping practices to combat the ongoing soil degradation and improve soil fertility in the region.

AB Land degradation and poverty caused by traditional arable agriculture have been serious problems in the ecologically fragile and economically backward mountains of Nepal. There is a prospect to address both of these problems to some extent by promoting livestock raising. However, a large livestock population exceeding the carrying capacity of land resources will risk undermining the sustainability and productivity of these resources. On the basis of these concerns, this study analyzes the carrying capacity of land resources under on-going and improved management systems based on total digestive nutrient (TDN) demand and supply situation in the study area. Results of analyses revealed that under the current type of management system, land resources in Shyangja district could provide the required amount of TDN to 147,735 livestock standard units (LSU), whereas the total number of LSU had already reached 203,510 as of 1996/97. Provided improvements are made in forest and grazing-land management as well as in crop production and agroforestry systems in line with assumptions made, land resources in the study area will be able to accommodate additional 6408 LSU on top of existing stock by the year 2001/02 and 63,113 LSU by the year 2006/07.

TI Forests in the economy of the rural poor: An estimation of the
   dependency level
SO AMBIO
LA English
DT Article
AB The rural people in India, particularly the tribals and poor, depend on forest resources for meeting their energy needs, forest products, and for employment. This paper gives details of one estimation of dependency of people on forests in villages in the Madhya Pradesh, Orissa, and Gujarat states of India. Benefits derived by the people were reflected as a percentage of the total income of the household. The dependency on forests varies from 37% to 76% in these villages. This kind of assessment would create a data base and provide indicators of sustainable forest management, especially for an understanding of the intricacies of Joint Forest Management. This information can be very useful in deriving the overall contribution of the forestry sector in the national economy and thus help the planners, administrators and foresters in evolving better management practices.

SO AMBIO
LA English

ID POPULATION; ECOSYSTEM; CHOICE
AB The increasing interest, and the actual necessity, for adequate means to evaluate how sustainable human activities are, has led to efforts to define indicators of sustainability. We propose the use of ecological indicators of sustainability that take into account the hierarchical structure of biodiversity, distinguishing composition, structure and function at the different levels of biological organization: ecosystem and landscape, community, and population and genetic levels. We evaluated the advantages of selecting and combining indicators of different hierarchical levels by examining several use and management projects. Examples of transformed land like large-scale plantations, perform well when evaluated by ecosystem-level indicators, but lead to neglect of some composition and structure components if evaluated at different levels. Limitations in using a small number of indicators become evident in cases of intensive exploitation of resources, such as the extractive reserves, which yield good results under the ecosystem and community levels, but fail under the population and genetic indicators. Wild species management, a common example of the use of population-level indicators, do not perform well under other indicators at broader scales. We also reviewed projects that are sustainable at different hierarchical levels, like some multispecific exploitation forestry management, in which harvesting of resources is at or below sustainable levels, selective extraction is performed, and where natural regeneration and recruitment of species is allowed. It is evident that the adequacy of indicators is not universal and must take into account the complexity of processes and variables involved in the different biological levels and human components, highlighting possible conflicts and contradictions, while increasing knowledge about maintenance of quality in the use and exploitation of resources that the relevant stakeholders regard as important.

ID COMMUNITY-BASED APPROACH; COASTAL MANAGEMENT; PACIFIC ISLANDS; LESSONS
AB Development planning and resource management in the Irish coastal zone have traditionally followed sectoral, top-down models, with limited opportunities for public participation or concertation of administrative effort. Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) is often proposed as an appropriate policy response in cases where these approaches have been seen to fail. In this paper, we argue that ICZM may be more sustainable if first introduced at a small scale. Local-level initiatives, designed to produce demonstrable benefits at an early stage, are perhaps more likely to engender long-term support for ICZM. This is particularly relevant where baseline data are lacking and coastal processes are poorly understood. Using seven county Donegal beach and dune systems as demonstration sites, the potential of this approach to provide scientifically-founded, locally-agreed management plans was tested over a range of coastal issues, such as progressive shoreline erosion, habitat loss, tourist development, conflicting recreational activities and traffic management. Progress at each of the sites was partially dependent on the existence, coherence and activity of existing community organizations. In the best example, a local development group already employing many of the central principles of ICZM (e.g. inclusive participation, working with natural processes) was identified. By focussing on local problems, practical solutions and relatively small numbers of stakeholders, agreement was reached on the majority of issues and strategies covered by the management plans. Implementation of the plans will begin in early 2000.

AB Cacao (Theobroma cacao) is a crop of the humid lowland tropics produced largely by small-scale producers and often on farms with a canopy of shade trees. Where a diverse shaded canopy is used, cacao farms support higher levels of biological diversity than most other tropical crops. A host of viral and fungal diseases, loss of soil fertility, and numerous socioeconomic problems facing producers, often makes cacao production locally unsustainable. Continued clearing of new lands threatens biodiversity. Moreover, new frontiers for cacao expansion are rapidly disappearing. Such problems can be addressed by increasing the long-term productivity of existing cacao farms and restoring abandoned lands. Improved shade management offers guidance along this path. Institutions involved with cocoa should establish collaborations with groups concerned with development, environmental protection, and most importantly producers themselves to pursue a program of research, extension and policy initiatives focused on the ecologically and economically sustainable cacao production on farms with a diverse shade canopy.

AB Although most psychologists do not see sustainability us a psychological problem, our environmental predicament is caused largely by human behaviors, accompanied by relevant thoughts, feelings, attitudes, and values. The huge task of building sustainable cultures Mill require a great many psychologists from a variety of backgrounds. In an effort to stimulate the imaginations of a wide spectrum of psychologists to take on the crucial problem of sustainability, this article discusses 4 psychological approaches (neo-analytic, behavioral, social, and cognitive) and outlines some of their insights into environmentally relevant behavior: These models are useful for illuminating ways to increase environmentally responsible behaviors of clients, communities. and professional associations.

AB Psychology has a central role to play in speeding the transition to a sustainable future, because a central aspect of sustainability is widespread behavior change. To date, however, most programs promoting sustainable behavior have featured information-intensive campaigns that make little use of psychological knowledge. Community-based social marketing is an attractive alternative approach in which promoters identify, the activity to be promoted and the barriers to this activity and then design a strategy to overcome these barriers, using psychological knowledge regarding behavior change. The strategy is piloted to test its effectiveness and later evaluated when it is implemented on a broader scale. Unlike many information-intensive campaigns, community-based social marketing has been shown to have a much greater probability of promoting sustainable behavior. Two case studies are provided to illustrate the approach and its possible results.

AB Data from the literature concerning stand aerial biomass, stand nutrient amount (i.e. N, P, K, Ca and Mg) of four major forest tree species of the temperate area were compiled in order to propose simple general relationships to quantify nutrient depletion associated with biomass harvesting. The objectives was to identify the tree species effect on nutrient loss through biomass removal. Mean weighted nutrient concentrations of aerial biomass decreased rapidly until the maximum current annual increment of stands was reached ("adult stands"); the concentration then became more or less constant. For adult stands, linear relations existed between aerial biomass and their nutrient amount. Using total aerial biomass (TAB) or stem biomass including bark (SBB) as references against the corresponding nutrient amount showed: i) that correlation coefficients were higher in the latter case, ii) that nutrient amount per unit of biomass was lower for SBB than for TAB, and iii) that these relations were species-dependent. For a same SBB, species were ranked as follows: mean concentration of N and K, European beech > Douglas fir = Norway spruce = Scots pine; Ca, European beech = Norway spruce greater than or equal to Scots pine greater than or equal to Douglas fir; Mg, European beech greater than or equal to Scots pine greater than or equal to Norway spruce greater than or equal to Douglas fir. For P, no significant difference was found for the tested species. The relationships between biomass and nutrient amount can be easily used by foresters to quantify the nutrient amount exported from a site during both thinning and harvesting operations, as well as the nutrients which remain in the logging residues left on the site and which will slowly yield available elements to the new plantation or the naturally regenerated stand.

ID PLATE
AB There is a worldwide interest in using pollution prevention methods to eliminate or lessen air, water, land and thermal pollution problems. Pollution prevention is designing processes that do not create pollution in the first place. Heat exchangers play an essential role in pollution prevention and in the reduction of environmental impact of industrial processes, by reducing energy consumption or recovering energy from processes in which they are used. They are used: (1) in pollution prevention or control systems that decrease volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and other air pollutant emissions; (2) in systems that decrease pollutants in wastewater discharges, the amount of the discharge and thermal pollution; and (3) used to recover energy in facilities that incinerate municipal solid waste and selected industrial hazardous wastes. Heat exchangers are also used in the heating, cooling and concentration of process streams that are part of many other pollution prevention or control related processes. In this paper, first presented is background information on the role of heat exchangers, their types, and a discussion of environment pollution problems. Next, the role of heat exchangers is outlined in the prevention and mitigation of the following pollution problems: air pollution from VOCs, sulphur oxides (SOx), nitrogen oxides (NOx); water pollution from industrial processes, thermal pollution, and land pollution resulting from municipal solid wastes or industrial hazardous wastes. Specific Research and Development needs for environmental heat exchangers are then summarized in the paper. It is hoped that this paper will challenge the heat transfer engineering community to further enhance the role of heat exchangers for pollution prevention and global sustainable development.

AB The five Swiss nuclear power plants were commissioned in 1969 - 1984 and contribute some 40 percent to the supply of electricity. Antinuclear initiatives were rejected in referenda in 1979, 1984, and 1990, while a ten-year moratorium on the construction of new nuclear power plants was accepted in 1990. A number of opt-out initiatives have been produced for the period after expiry of this moratorium. The development of nuclear waste management proceeds but slowly and step by step. The central interim store at Wurenlingen (ZWILAG) for ail types of radioactive waste is currently starting operation. After lengthy technical and political negotiations, which resulted in the concept of "controlled geologic long term storage", efforts are gaining fresh momentum to build a repository for low and medium level waste in the Wellenberg. Also, completion of the demonstration of existing waste management provisions for high level waste is becoming foreseeable. The activities increasingly mounted by nuclear opponents require additional efforts to demonstrate sustainably the evident ecological and economic benefits of nuclear power.

TI Knowledge architecture for the twenty-first century
SO BEHAVIOUR & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper begins with defining data, information, knowledge, and wisdom and proposes an architecture for managing knowledge (which is different from managing information). This architecture helps us to develop different perspectives, not just patterns and relationships. An example is presented of a group that used this approach to build a sustainability framework. The twenty-first century is going to be about creating pathways to a sustainable future. Creating a shared understanding of what data, information, knowledge, and wisdom mean to us and how they interrelate enables us to define and move along those pathways. Applying our model of knowledge architecture from a position of values, principles, and beliefs will allow us to evolve a deeper understanding of what a sustainable future could mean to us and how we can pursue it. The framework presented contains essential ingredients to be explored in building our future:
   'We struggle between the 1% of what we know, 1% of what we don't know but rarely come across the 98% of what we don't know that we don't know'. (Buckminster Fuller, full details not available).

ID ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION; ECOLOGY
AB In Africa, the movement away from traditional protectionist conservation to community-based approaches is partially related to postmodernist influences. Proposed transfrontier conservation areas will incorporate local communities, and a clearer understanding of the limitations of community-based conservation is thus needed. The sustainability of community-based conservation projects is questioned on economic and other grounds, and many African countries lack the prerequisites (ecological, demographic and sociological) for successful programmes. The romanticisation of pre-colonial societies gives undue weight to traditional systems of resource management, and we challenge the postmodernist notion that traditional peoples practised sustainable harvesting of natural resources. It is suggested that this will occur only under unlikely conditions of low human population density, lack of access to modern technology, and limited exposure to consumerism. In agriculture, postmodernists interpret the overstocking of livestock as a rational socioeconomic response, thus giving the practice unjustified legitimacy. The allied proposition that peasants enjoy a rich diversity of farming practices is largely unfounded, at least in some parts of Africa. We conclude that postmodernist thinking has had a significant negative impact on conservation science in Africa, largely by marginalising the central issue of human population pressure. Towards more effective African conservation, we suggest roles for the ecologist, for the social scientist, and for the donor community.

AB Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) root colonization was studied in a long-term field trial in which four farming systems currently in use in Switzerland were continuously applied to a randomized set of plots at a single field site from 1978 till 1993. There were two low-input farming systems (organic and bio-dynamic) and two high-input (conventional) farming systems (according to Swiss guidelines of integrated plant production with and without farmyard manure). The systems had an identical 7-year crop rotation and tillage scheme and differed essentially only in the amount and type of fertilizer supplied and in plant protection management. The percentage of root colonization by AM fungi was determined in field samples 2-3 times over the growing season in crops in the rotation, namely in winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L. cv. Sardona), vetch-rye and grass-clover. We found the percentage of root length colonized by AM fungi to be 30-60% higher (P less than or equal to 0.05) in the plants grown in soils from the low-input farming systems than in those grown in conventionally farmed soils. Approximately 50% of the variation of AM root colonization was explained by chemical properties of the soils (pH, soluble P and K, exchangeable Mg), the effect of soluble soil P being most pronounced. The potential of the field soils from the differently managed plots to cause symbiosis with AM fungi was tested in a glasshouse experiment, using wheat as a host plant. Soils from the low-input farming systems had a greatly enhanced capacity to initiate AM symbiosis. The relative differences in this capacity remained similar when propagules of the AM fungus Glomus mosseae were experimentally added to the soils, although overall root colonization by AM fungi was 2.8 times higher.

AB The magnitude and implications for the construction industry of reductions in carbon dioxide emissions that will ultimately be required globally and in industrialized countries are critically examined. As a result of the problem of climate change, these reductions are found to be in the region of 80-90% by 2050 - much larger than those presently under discussion in national and global political fora. The technological feasibility of buildings with low energy requirements and low carbon emissions suggests that existing technology is capable of delivering reductions in this range. Unfortunately, the progress that is being made at the cutting edge is, with very few exceptions, not carried over into building stocks as a whole. Regulatory, fiscal and market-based policy and strategy mechanisms for improving the performance both of new build and the existing stock are critically examined. The achievement of meaningful reductions will require a coordinated and strategic approach, which makes use of the complementarity between these mechanisms. Regulation alone, in the absence of clear and consistent price signals provided through mechanisms such as carbon taxation, is unlikely to deliver the reductions in carbon emissions that will be needed to stabilize the global atmosphere and climate.

TI Analysing the life-cycle energy of an Australian residential building

AB Life cycle energy analysis (LCEA) is used to assign energy values to product flows in each phase of an activity's life cycle. In the case of a residential building, this usually comprises energy embodied in the manufacture of building materials, energy used in the building's operation, and in periodic maintenance. In order to place these amounts of energy in a national context, the energy embodied in other goods and services consumed by householders also needs to be considered. This paper uses LCEA to demonstrate the need for considering not only the life cycle energy of the building but also the life cycle energy attributable to activities being undertaken by actual users of the building. The life cycle energy of an Australian residential building as well as common activities of households are analysed and simulated over a 30 year period using a worked example of a two bedroom, brick-veneer, semi-detached unit. The importance of considering the energy embodied in the initial construction of a residential building as well as the consumption of goods and services by householders is demonstrated as having long-term implications. In order to encourage sustainable living practices it is suggested that architects more closely consider the activities of householders when designing residential buildings, especially in temperate climates. The paper concludes by identifying future areas of research for LCEA in the residential sector.

AB The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act recognizes that fish stocks depend on healthy ecosystems and requires that fishery managers expand their management regimes to include the very basis of healthy fisheries-the habitat itself. The 1996 amendments to this primary United States marine fishery-management law include a new mandate to identify habitats essential to managed living marine resources and to take steps to ensure that those habitats remain healthy and can support sustainable fisheries. Until now, the legislative mandate for protecting habitat for marine and anadromous stocks came through statutes not specifically focused on the needs of commercial and recreational fish species. Now, there is explicit linkage between fishery-management programs, traditionally designed to manage the harvesting activity itself, and efforts to ensure that fishing and nonfishing activities do not undermine the productivity of the stocks. This emphasis on habitat health and productivity brings a broader ecosystem perspective to traditional fishery management. The insertion of essential fish habitat (EFH) provisions into fisheries management has been an enormous undertaking. The agency and the regional fishery management councils, working with other partners, completed the first stage of the process within very tight statutory deadlines. The councils have made use of all of the tools provided them under the act and the EFH regulations, such as designating habitat areas of particular concern (EFH-HAPCs), recommending fishing restrictions within special areas, defining priority research and information needs, and documenting threats and conservation measures appropriate for federal actions that may adversely affect EFH. This effort has entailed a great deal of scientific as well as policy analysis. We are currently implementing the federal consultation process to address threats to fish habitat in a consistent and timely manner. This new habitat thrust will align fishery managers and scientists with new allies in the habitat arena, increasing benefits to marine resource-management programs and fishery management. As suggested by the theme of this issue, an understanding and consideration of marine reserves and other special-area management concepts can benefit federal fishery management. This article gives an overview of how the fishery-management councils are fulfilling the essential fish habitat mandate by using a broader ecosystem approach to conservation that considers the ecological role of managed species, analyzes species' habitat needs from state waters to the high seas, and examines shifts in population health and sustainability over the course of decades.

AB Coastal zones are usually managed with two main objectives: (1) conservation/maintenance of biodiversity and. intrinsic ecosystem services and (2) maintenance of sustainable fisheries. The management needs that can be met with marine protected areas fall into corresponding categories. First, fully protected (that is, no-take) reserves-parks-offer benchmarks and protect ecosystem integrity while encouraging research, education, and aesthetic appreciation of nature. Second, by allowing focused local control of human impacts, marine protected areas can be used to focus more intense local management designed to increase yield and allow research to help define sustainability and protect against uncertainty by using carefully managed fisheries as a research tool. We have been gambling with the future by establishing a poor balance between short-term profit and long-term risks. The absence of meaningful, fully protected reserves has produced a situation in which there are virtually no areas north of the Antarctic in the world's oceans that have exploitable resources where scientists can study natural marine systems. In most areas the higher-order predators and many other important species have been virtually eliminated; many benthic habitats have been much changed by fishing activities. Without solid data documenting changes through time, the relative merits of various causes and effects that operate in complex ecological systems can always be argued. Without natural systems important questions cannot be studied-for example, how the ecosystem roles of various species can be assessed, how they can be managed in a sustainable manner, and how we can evaluate resilience or relative rates of recovery. Networks of fully-protected reserves could facilitate research into such questions, contribute to the recovery of many coastal systems, and enable society to enrich its existence by observing species that should be part of its heritage (Murray ct al., 1999). The use of marine protected areas as fishing refugia has met strong resistance by fishers and many managers, and it is misunderstood by many conservation biologists because different proponents have different, usually simplistic, visions. It is important to spell out the objectives of each proposed example. Our essential habitat perspective emphasizes that each situation depends on specific life-history parameters and emphasizes critical thresholds in population dynamics, including density and behavior for fertilization, transport processes, settlement, survivorship, and growth to maturity. These are extremely difficult problems, and we cannot expect simplistic solutions to be effective. The only basis for optimism is that most of the seriously affected species are not yet extinct, and we still have a little time to establish permanent fully protected reserves to allow mankind to appreciate its rich but much depleted biological heritage. At least in some systems recovery can be measured over short time scales (<10 yrs), whereas others are much slower. Society as a whole is the ultimate stakeholder, not only the commercial and sports fishing industries that so dominate the public arena. Society will have to play a more active role if these species and habitats are to be saved.

ID MARINE RESERVES
AB Marine reserves have come under criticism because of the short-term fishery losses likely to be associated with them. At the same time,:marine reserves have been touted as a tool to rehabilitate depleted populations, at least for species with relatively limited adult movement. I used models to compare the short- and long-term fisheries consequences of three fishery-management tools for depleted populations. These management tools included temporary closure of the entire fishery, minimum size limits, and marine reserves. I compared them using three short-term indices: magnitude of initial drop in catches relative to those prior to new management, years until catches reached prior levels, and cumulative loss during those years. I examined a single long-term index: long-term sustainable yields. Results highlighted the potential of reserves as an efficient and effective fishery-management tool for species that will remain within reserve boundaries. Reserves created few short-term losses beyond those associated with other management measures, yet produced the highest stable catch levels. Moreover, peak catches with reserves occurred with less restriction than peak catches with other management measures. These results were consistent across two species that matured before entering the fishery but did not apply to one species that was fished while immature. In that latter case, minimum size limits produced more substantial benefits; than reserves could. Nevertheless, these analyses suggest that a wide range of circumstances exist where reserves, if properly designed to minimize adult spillover while allowing abundant larval transport, can maximize fisheries harvests with a minimum of total restrictions.

AB Ludwig (1995) argued that (1) management for sustained yield cannot be optimal and (2) effective management models cannot be realistic. I concur, and I begin with the view that sustained yield is more important than maximum yield; indeed maximum sustained yield must become a constraint rather than a target. Mangel et al. (1996) stress that we are very far from managing ecosystems; we manage human interventions in ecosystems. Following Ludwig's advice, I will use a relatively simple model to show how essential fish habitat and fishing mortality are intimately connected-loss of spawning habitat is equivalent to additional fishing mortality on adults. Reserves can help guarantee sustainability of the fishery, even when fishing mortality outside the reserve cannot be very well controlled (despite attempts to do so). In fact, in some circumstances (identified by the model) reserves can simultaneously enhance the stock, protect habitat, and increase catch. Finally, I will show how the model can be used to help resolve the reserve design question, which in this case is how we decide how much spawning habitat and how much of the fishing ground to protect.

AB Management for sustainable fisheries requires effective tactics for limiting exploitation rates. Limitation based on annual stock assessments and total allowable catches calculated from these assessments can be very dangerous, and marine protected areas (MPAs) are one means by which to limit exploitation rate directly even when total stock size is highly uncertain. This application of MPAs would probably require much larger areas than are now envisioned for limited objectives related to protection of seed spawning stock and local biodiversity. It might in fact cause a basic shift in thinking-from regarding MPAs as exceptional areas to regarding fishing areas as the exception las is now the practice in, e.g., salmon and herring fisheries). The present paper describes the use of ECOSPACE, a new modeling tool based on ecosystem simulations, for preliminary determination of how large MPAs need to be; ECOSPACE models suggest that dispersal, trophic responses (prey depletion, increased dispersal of predators in response to competition), and spatial fishing-effort responses (concentration of fishing near MPA boundaries) are all likely to reduce the effectiveness of small MPAs. The models suggest we should see not simple high-low density differences across MPA boundaries but rather spatial gradients from law density in exploited areas to high density near the centers of larger MPAs. Such spatial density gradients should be accompanied by spatially organized 'trophic cascade' patterns if trophic interactions are important determinants of abundance. MPA design can work with or against spatial variation in fishing effort caused by economic cost and risk factors; ECOSPACE can help to demonstrate ecological consequences of alternative design strategies, but the most important uncertainties are about socioeconomic responses (cooperation or competition) rather than ecological ones. Design of experimental policies and monitoring programs for evaluation of MPAs should proceed from careful modeling to define likely spatial, temporal, and trophic scales for both ecological and fishing responses.

AB The function and services are the important components of the life-support system in the planet, as well as the basic elements for sustainable development of environment and society. It is a must to evaluate it for incorporating it with the social-economic system. It is also an important approach to draw the public attention on the environmental and ecosystem conservation. In this study, the ecosystem function and services in China were estimated by employing the classification and economic parameters from Costanza et al. The type and area of terrestrial ecosystems were extracted from Vegetation Map of China (1.4 000 000), and then the distribution map of ecosystem services of China was drawn. According to our calculation, the total value of ecosystem services in China is 77 834.48x10(8) RMB yuan per annum. The value for terrestrial ecosystem is 56 098.46x10(8) yuan per annum, and that for marine ecosystem is 21 736.02x10(8) yuan per annum. The value of ecosystem services in China is 1.73 times bigger than GDP in 1994. The value for forest ecosystem services is 15 433.98x10(8) yuan per annum, which is 27.51% of the total annual ecosystem services in China. Although wetland is little in area, its ecosystem service value is huge, which is 26 736.9x10(8) yuan per annum. The value for grassland ecosystem is 8 697.68x10(8) yuan per annum. Coastal ecosystem service is 12 223.04x10(8) yuan per annum. Overall, the ecosystem service in China contributes 2.71% to that of our planet. The estimation method employed in this study was a conservative one, and should be improved in the future studies.

DE quarrying; sustainable development; environmental issues
AB The existence of quarries near or even within the boundaries of urban centres is the cause of many environmental problems, despite their significant contribution to the cities' development. Hence, the question arises as to how quarrying activities can be compromised within the spirit of sustainable development in bia cities. In the case of Athens, two dominant though opposite opinions have been formed. The first argues that ail quarries must be forced to suspend their activities as soon as possible; the second presses for the continuation of quarrying. Consequently, the question is transposed on the dilemma between improved environmental conditions and economic development. This paper demonstrates that ii a complete redesign is employed to specific, nonvisible quarrying sites, the continuation of quarrying activities is acceptable. It is a good compromise between the economical demand and environmental protection.

AB Current varieties of canola/oilseed rape, Brassica napus L. and Brassica rapa L., are susceptible to infestation by the root maggots Delia radicum (L.) and Delia floralis (Fallen) (Diptera: Anthomyiidae) in western Canada. Crop losses from root maggot infestations can be very significant, and infestation levels have increased substantially from 1983 to present. Although cultural and chemical strategies exist to reduce crop losses caused by root maggots, these methods are either not sufficiently effective or pose unacceptable environmental risk. This paper reports progress achieved to develop canola cultivars resistant to attack by root maggots as the most environmentally sustainable strategy for management of these pests. Twelve species of Brassicaceae, and many genotypes within species, were evaluated for levels of root maggot resistance, in addition to many intergeneric hybrids produced by crosses of Sinapis alba x B. napus. Sinapis alba had greatest resistance to infestation by root maggots among the Brassicaceae species evaluated, and five intergeneric hybrids had levels of resistance to root maggots that were similar to S. alba and were maintained from year to year. Low amounts of S. alba DNA were detected in the hybrids using genomic slot-blot analysis. These results indicate that a genetic basis for resistance to root maggot infestation exists in the Brassicaceae, and our research represents the first step toward introgression of genetic sources of root maggot resistance from related species into commercial canola varieties.

ID SUSTAINABILITY
AB In Africa, aquaculture has developed only recently and so far has made only a small contribution to economic development and food security. We review developments and identify constraints to the expansion of aquaculture in economic and rural development at the continental, national and farm levels. Past development initiatives failed to achieve sustainable increases in production. In contrast, a growing number of smallholder farmers in many countries have been adopting and adapting pond aquaculture to their existing farming systems and slowly increasing their production efficiency. An evolutionary approach that builds on a fusion of local and outside participation in technology development and transfer appears more likely to produce fish production systems that are more productive and more environmentally and socially sustainable in the long term.

ID INCOME-DISTRIBUTION; INEQUALITY; GROWTH
AB This paper discusses the importance of intra-generational equity to sustainable development. II outlines a number of methodologies for measuring income inequality in the economy, and presents several possible ways of incorporating the impact of distributional effects into measures of welfare in the economy. The authors highlight in particular an index developed by Atkinson (Atkinson, A.B., 1970. Distributive politics and economic growth. Q. J. Econ., May, 465-490.) based on the social welfare model. This method possesses two main advantages over other methods. Firstly, it is expressed directly in terms of social well-being. Secondly, value judgements incorporated into the measure are made explicit through the parameter epsilon which expresses society's degree of aversion to income inequality. The paper calculates the value of the Atkinson index for two case study countries (Sweden and the UK) between 1950 and 1996 for a central estimate of epsilon = 0.8. The results show that the welfare loss due to inequalities in the distribution of income varied between 5 and 10% for Sweden, and between 6 and 14% for the UK, with the higher values coming towards the end of the period. The paper explores the sensitivity of these results to changes in the value of epsilon for the case of the UK, and discusses the relevance of the work to the measurement of sustainable welfare.

DE Brazil; income accounting; ecosystem valuation; total economic value
ID FOREST PRODUCTS; RAIN-FOREST; VALUATION
AB National income accounting has been criticized because of its failure to encompass the notion of sustainability. Several studies address this problem through 'green' income accounting - i.e. by adjusting conventionally measured GDP for reduction in a given country's 'stock' of natural resources. These studies generally base value on the unit net price of the resource. Other studies go beyond net price, emphasizing a natural resource's total economic value (TEV) - that is, its non-marketable as well as its marketable values. This paper combines the green income accounting and TEV approaches and applies the new framework to Brazil in order to assess the foregone economic benefits resulting from Amazonian deforestation. The results lend support to calls for greater policy emphasis on conservation of unique and irreplaceable ecosystems. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

This paper provides comparative analyses of village level domestic energy consumption patterns across coastal, interior, hilly and plain zones considering regional and seasonal variations. Cooking, water heating and space heating are the major end use activities. The results, based on eighteen months of field research in five taluks of Uttara Kannada, reveal that the average energy consumption norm does vary significantly for cooking and water heating in various seasons across the zones, Among the five taluks, 90 villages (out of 119) and all divisions of Kumta town in the Kumta taluk and 190-220 randomly selected households in selected villages of Sirsi, Mundgod, Siddapur and Ankola were studied. A survey of 1304 households from 90 villages in the Kumta taluk shows that most of them still use traditional stoves for cooking (97.92%) and water heating (98.3%). Average consumption (kg/person/day) for cooking ranges from 2.01 +/- 1.49 (coastal) to 2.32 +/- 2.09 (hilly). Seasonwise cooking fuel wood requirement for coast and hilly zones, ranges from 1.98 and 2.22 (summer) to 2.11 and 2.51 (monsoon), respectively, while for water heating (for bath and washing), it ranges from 1.17 +/- 0.02 (coast) to 1.63 +/- 0.05 (hilly). Seasonal variation is evident from the range 1.12 and 1.53 (summer) to 1.22 and 1.73 (monsoon) for coastal and hilly zones, respectively. Analysis of other sources of energy for domestic purposes shows that kerosene is used for cooking and lighting in the coast. Kerosene consumption (1/person/month) for cooking ranges from 0.05 (hilly) to 0.34 (coast) and for lighting ranges from 0.75 (coast) to 0.99 (hilly). Availability of bioresources in hilly zone is the main reason for less consumption of kerosene for cooking. In the hilly zone, electrification of all households has not been possible, as they are scattered. Because of the erratic supply during all seasons (especially monsoon), electrified households also depend on kerosene for lighting. Based on fuel consumption norms (regionwise, seasonwise and end use wise), (a) the total fuel wood required (cooking, water heating, space heating, jaggery making and parboiling) works out to 1.668,698.23 tonnes/year, (b) the electricity demand, excluding irrigation, is about 32.65 million kWh/year and (c) the kerosene demand for cooking and water heating is about 15.86 million litres per year.

AB This paper discusses the way Norway has organized its gas sales, and to what extent Norwegian regulatory goals are reconcilable with EU gas market objectives. Although there are strong arguments in favor of governmental resource management and coordination of Norwegian offshore activities, there are also a series of reasons why the existing organization of gas sales is not the right one in a liberalized market.

AB The relationship between environment and tourism in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) can be portrayed as symbiotic, embedded within processes of postcommunist restructuring. With reference to specific CEE experience, I will evaluate briefly in this paper some of the components, problems, and outcomes of five dimensions of the tourism-environment relationship. These are: environment as a stimulus to tourism; environment as a constraint on tourism; tourism and sustainability; environment and place marketing; and tourism impacts on the environment. It is concluded that, although tourism should be viewed as just one element of postcommunist development, it has a multifaceted relationship with natural and cultural environments which demands that particular attention be paid to sustainable management.

AB Management of recreational activity in areas that are culturally or ecologically sensitive requires knowledge, and effective management, of recreationists' behaviour. In this paper we explore the role of spatial information systems, spatial modelling, and virtual reality in the analysis and prediction of visitor location and movement patterns. The quantitative modelling of the time spent by visitors on various aspects of the site attractions and of visitor conflict has not been widely attempted, having only recently become possible because of greater computer power, better spatial data storage options, and new modelling paradigms. Rule-driven autonomous agents can be used as surrogates for human visitors. Behavioural rules can be derived and calibrated fi om visitor surveys. This is, however, an expensive and time-consuming process and testing of people's decisions in a virtual environment may provide sufficient information for rule definition. Once a rule-set is determined, the autonomous agents move over a GIS-based model of the landscape. Rendering algorithms determine what an individual agent is able to 'see'. Based on the established rules, this and other factors (such as tiredness) determine behavioural choice. Recording of model runs to file allows managers to undertake additional analysis to quantify and explore the influence of alternative management options on recreationist movement, congestion, and crowding. Through the GIS, impacts such as erosion can also be modelled. In the longer term the combined models can become part of a decision support system for sustainable tourism in fragile environments.

AB Water resources in the arid zones of northwest China mainly come from mountain areas and then flow to and disappear in the piedmont plains. These water resources, with inland river basins as the geographic unit, form relatively independent ecosystems and the surface runoff flowing out of the mountain mouth becomes the only water source available for the middle and lower reaches of these basins. Both the ecosystem stability and sustainable development depend on the surface water and groundwater resources of these inland river basins. Over the last 50 years, exploitation of water and land resources in the arid northwest regions of China has been expanding, forming 390.07 X 10(4) ha of irrigation eases, with construction of 622 reservoirs of different sizes with a total storage capacity of 65.5 X 10(8) m(3) ensuring the sustainable development of industrial and agricultural production. In the meantime it has also caused a series of environmental changes. Discharge of the majority of rivers has been drastically reduced (even dried up), river courses have been shortened, and terminal lakes contracted or dried up. Land desertification and soil salinization has developed rapidly. Vegetation is degrading and biodiversity is decreasing, as compared with the early 1950s; the natural grassland area is decreasing by 16-75.4%. Economical and high-effective use of water resources and harmonization of eco-environment benefits with economic benefits are the fundamental ways to achieve sustainable development of arid northwest China.

AB This paper presents an optimal endogenous growth model with pollution accumulation and abatement activities which analyzes the implications of pollution accumulation irreversibility on the existence of sustainable growth paths. This model studies different pollution-decay functions which present, among others, the feature that a sufficiently high pollution stock level can reduce the rate of decay to zero. This study shows that this new feature, which gains support for the biological literature, significantly alters the traditional results on the properties of sustainable endogenous growth by reducing the field of existence and strengthening the role of individual preferences.

AB Objectives: To estimate the total (CV(t)), within-subject (CV(w) ) and between-subject (CV(b)) variation in free-living energy expenditure as measured by the doubly-labelled water (DLW) technique. To examine the limitation of the DLW measurement of energy expenditure for evaluating reported energy intake. To estimate the probable minimum and maximum 'habitual' energy expenditures far a sustainable lifestyle.
   Design: Review and analysis of individual data from 25 studies with repeat DLW measurements of energy expenditure (EE).
   Results: Pooled mean CV(w) derived from 21 studies was 11.8% far EE and 12.3% for physical activity level (PAL). Multiple regression analysis of CV(w) in 25 studies found a positive association with time span between measurements. At zero time CV(w) for EE was 8.2% rising to 9.6% at 13 weeks and 15.4% at 52 weeks. At the same lime points CV(w) for PAL was 9.1%, 10.0% and 13.4% respectively. Pooled mean CV(t) was 13.0% for EE and 10.7% for PAL. CV(b) calculated from pooled mean CV(t) and CV(w) was 20.6% for EE and 7.2% for PAL. 95% confidence limits of PAL in 11 age-sex groups averaged 1.2 to 2.2.
   Conclusions: The analysis supported previous estimates of 8% for within-subject variation in DLW measurements including analytic plus inherent biologic variation. Variation that included changes in weight, season and activity increased with increased time between measurements to about 15% at a time span of 12 months. confidence limits of agreement between EE and reported energy intake were estimated to range from +/- 15% to +/- 32%. Estimates of the range of usual EE for normally active persons ranged from 1.3 to 2.2.

AB Marine reserves are increasingly proposed as a management tool. Models can play a valuable role in the evaluation of the possible benefits of reserves because they allow us to conduct many more investigations than could ever be done empirically. In this paper, I develop a model for a marine reserve for an open population subject to environmental uncertainty.

AB Russian forests are of high importance for the Russian economy, the European wood market, for nature conservation, and for carbon sequestration. However, the ongoing changes in forest management and administration in Russia led to uncertainty about forest ownership, wood harvesting levels, and long-term impacts of alternative management plans. Therefore, better insight in their current and future state is highly desirable. We present a study for the Leningrad region forests in which alternative management regimes for wood production and nature conservation values are balanced in varying ways. The total forest land area in the Leningrad region forest fund is 4.8 million ha. Coniferous species dominate and due to the natural succession occurring, the forests are divers in vertical structurally.
   A timber assessment model was used to project the forest until 2040. Five forest management scenarios were run. Special attention was paid to a scenario that simulates recovery of the Russian forest sector in combination with the incorporation of a 'set-aside for nature conservation' policy. All scenarios showed that recovery of the forest sector in the Leningrad region is biologically feasible. A sustainable continuous annual production of 10.6 million m(3) per year (2.8 m(3) ha(-1) per year) by 2040 was found. The 'Recovery with Nature Conservation' scenario showed that recovery of the forest sector in combination with the establishment of set-aside areas is very well feasible. It was possible to set aside 28% of the forest area for nature conservation while still developing a forest sector to a production level higher than that achieved in the late eighties.
   The timber assessment model applied was not specifically designed to incorporate nature-oriented forest management. We, therefore, discuss ways of improving the required methodology to analyse long-term effects of nature-oriented forest management in Europe. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

ID MODEL; OPTIMIZATION; ALGORITHM
AB This article addresses the any-aged forest management problem with individual trees as the choice variables in integer programming models. In order to sustain the forest using natural regeneration, spatial proximity of seed trees is required for harvesting to take place in these models. This problem requires integer variables to avoid harvesting part of a tree, but it is remarkably integer-friendly. Solvability of large models is thus explored, along with the patterns of solution that can be recognized in smaller models. Results from these exploratory models are sensitive to initial forest conditions and do not display the steady state conditions typically assumed for uneven-aged management in the literature.

   PERSPECTIVE
AB Within Canada, and internationally, an increasing demand that forests be managed to maintain all resources has led to the development of criteria and indicators of sustainable forest management. There is, however, a lack of understanding, at an operational scale, how to evaluate and compare forest management activities to ensure the sustainability of all resources. For example, nationally, many of the existing indicators are too broad to be used directly at a local scale of forest management; provincially, regulations are often too prescriptive and rigid to allow for adaptive management; and forest certification programs, often based largely on public or stakeholder opinion instead of scientific understanding, may be too local in nature to permit a comparison of operations across a biome. At an operational scale indicators must be relevant to forest activities and ecologically integrated. In order to aid decision-makers in the adaptive management necessary for sustainable forest management, two types of indicators are identified: those that are prescriptive to aid in planning forest management and those that are evaluative to be used in monitoring and suggesting improvements. An integrated approach to developing standards based on an ecosystem management paradigm is outlined for the boreal forest where the variability inherent in natural systems is used to define the limits within which forest management is ecologically sustainable. Sustainability thresholds are thus defined by ecosystem response after natural disturbances. For this exercise, standards are proposed for biodiversity, forest productivity via regeneration, soil conservation and aquatic resources. For each of these standards, planning indicators are developed for managing forest conditions while forest values are evaluated by environmental indicators, thus leading to a continuous cycle of improvement. Approaches to developing critical thresholds and corresponding prescriptions are also outlined. In all cases, the scale of evaluation is clearly related to the landscape (or FMU) level while the stand level is used for measurement purposes. In this view the forest should be managed as a whole even though forest interventions are usually undertaken at the stand level.

AB The ecological processes underpinning commodity production have been largely overlooked by theories of social regulation and governance. Conventional applications of regulation theory, for example, often reduce the complex interactions between the environment and processes of accumulation to an homogenous surface on which the institutions of social regulation are inscribed. By contrast, this paper illustrates how the metabolism of production - the flows of raw materials, energy, and wastes central to the production of commodities from the natural environment - can provoke its own set of contradictions for particular industrial sectors. These contradictions can emerge to challenge accumulation in specific industrial sectors when existing practices and institutions fail to ensure continued access to resources and/or to effectively regulate the impacts of production on the environment.
   This paper describes how historical patterns of using nature in one primary commodity sector - copper mining and processing contributed to declining profitability in this industry during the early 1980s. The process of copper production is analyzed to identify a series of underlying 'ecological contradictions' that have the potential to impact profitability. The expression of these contradictions is then examined in the specific context of the US Southwest during the 1980s, with particular attention paid to conflicts over the environmental impacts of mining and the accessibility of land to mining firms. The emergence of social conflict over land access and the environment is interpreted in terms of the historical specificity - and obsolescence - of the framework of institutions, legislation and customary relations between corporations, the state and activist groups that had formerly contained and regulated these contradictions.

AB Windows of opportunity and product life cycles have been shortening in recent years, placing pressure on firms to sta). competitive. Many firms have responded to this pressure by setting goals of reducing new product development (NPD) cycle time and/or improving product performance, often by setting up fuzzy gates between stages, cross-functional teams, or both. This study examines the tradeoff between product performance and time to market, focusing on the effect of overlapping stages during which marketing, design, and manufacturing engineering are jointly working on performance improvement. An NPD process model comprising a design stage, a process stage, and an intermediary overlap stage representing the interaction between design and process personnel is developed, Key findings include the following. 1) Overlapping stages reduces time to market, but the marginal returns to lengthening the overlap stage yield progessively smaller improvements in time to market. 2) The longer the market window is open, the less is the pressure to rush the product to market, and product performance can be further improved by leaving the product longer in development. 3) It is better to keep the product longer in development rather than accelerate time to market if the base product performance is low. 4) If the productivity of the overlap stage is increased, it is more profitable to keep the product in development longer and boost product performance at launch than to rush the product to market quicker. 5) The greater the market power the firm possesses, the faster it should bring the product to market, as long as product performance and sustainability of market power are not substantially reduced. A set of propositions is derived from the model, and Is tested in a small-scale empirical study on firms in the automobile and automotive supply industry. The results are largely supportive of the propositions. Management implications and recommendations for further research are presented.

AB Field trials were conducted during 1978-79 to 1988-89 at Palampur and 1977-78 to 1994-95 at Pantnagar while at RS Pura from 1981-82 to 1994-95 to study the long-term effect of inorganic fertilizer application on yield sustainability and soil fertility in rice-wheat cropping system. The results showed that the system's productivity could be stable over years with the application of 40-80-40 kg NPK/ha at Palampur, 80-40-40 kg NPK/ha at R S Pura and 120-40-40 kg NPK/ha at Pantnagar. The soil fertility build-up was not observed at any of the sites with the application of NPK due to continuous cropping of rice (Oryza sativa L.)- wheat (Triticum aestivum L. emend. Fiori & Paol.) sequence except at Palampur and Pantnagar where increase in available phosphorus was noticed over the initial soil status.

ID DEEP-WATER CONDITIONS
AB A field experiment was conducted during 1994 and 1995 at Cuttack to study the yield performance of rice (Oryza sativa L.) varieties of early-duration ('Annada' - dwarf, 105 days and 'Banaprabha' - semi-tall, 95 days) and long-duration ('Gayatri' - semi-dwarf, 170 days and 'CR 260-77' - semi-tall, 170 days) in pure (sole crops) and mixed row stand (1:1 and 1:2 ratio) under intermediate lowland condition. The conventional long-duration varieties gave more than double the grain yield obtained from the early varieties in pure stand. The tall varieties of both maturity groups ('Banaprabha' and 'CR 260-77') performed better than dwarf varieties ('Annada' and 'Gayatri') in pure as well as mixed stand. The total grain yield in mixed stand of 'Banaprabha' with long-duration varieties was significantly higher(16.1-16.9%) than pure crop of late variety alone. The increase in yield in mixed stand was due to long-duration varieties which gave 82.6-85.3% of their yield in pure stand due to higher panicle weight following wider row spacing after the harvest of early varieties in September. Land-equivalent ratio in mixed cropping of 'Gayatri' or 'CR 260-77' with 'Banaprabha' was 1.40-1.52 but only 1.14-1.21 with 'Annada'. An yield advantage of about 0.5 tonne/ha was achieved in the mixed cropping system which could be beneficial for avoiding. risk and achieving sustainable production in the fragile lowland ecosystems.

AB Much of what we thought was true about Amazon rainforest has turned out to be not quite so. As perceptions sharpen, the value of the Amazon ecosystem is becoming more fully appreciated, as are the consequences of converting this forest to other uses. Even though the regions's forest can spring back after many assaults, continued deforestation, fire, and forest fragmentation might eventually lead to the formation of a stable fire-prone scrub vegetation where rainforests now occur. To move toward lasting solutions to the knotty conservation and development problems that now face the Amazon region will require vision, a strong government presence, the continued growth of civic responsibility, agile NGOs, and vocal scientists.

AB The natural-step framework is used by over 100 organizations, including many global corporations in Europe and the United States, to provide strategic direction for their sustainability initiatives. The framework is built on the concept of simplicity without reduction. Out of respect for complexity, we designed it to provide a compass, a guide for strategic direction. The framework consists of a backcasting planning process for sustainable development based on four principles (system conditions) for sustainability. The framework does not prescribe detailed actions. Once an organization understands the framework, it identifies and specifies the detailed means by which to achieve the strategy, because it knows its business best. The steps in the planning process are understanding and discussing the system conditions for sustainability, describing and discussing how the company relates to the system conditions in today's situation, creating a vision of how the company will fulfill its customers' needs in the future while complying with the system conditions, and specifying a program of actions that will take the company from today's situation to the future vision.

AB Macroeconomic definitions of sustainability focus on the need to maintain aggregate stocks of natural and manufactured capital constant over time, so that future generations have consumption possibilities similar to those of the current generation. Similar tests can be applied at the firm level. To be sustainable, a company must maintain on its balance sheet an undiminished level of total net assets, measured at their social costs. It must also pass a similar test when assets are valued at prevailing private costs. To make realistic assessments of a country's or firm's sustainability, therefore, one needs to consider its overall economic performance as well as its environmental performance. By this definition, sustainability is intimately linked to the fundamental preoccupations of business managers: productivity, investment, and profit.

DE industries; computer; electronic environment
AB Shape, Inc. is the last remaining videocassette manufacturer in the united States. It successfully competes against foreign suppliers with a nearly 50-fold labor-cost advantage using a combination of automation and innovative design. One of its products, the Global Zero (GO) videocassette, exemplifies many of the precepts outlined by sustainable design. Developed over a period of three years by the design firm E Media and coming into production in January 1993, the Global Zero offers an alternative that is cost-effective to manufacture, offers consumer advantages, is 100-percent recyclable, and has the potential for a closed-loop material usage cycle.

TI Stepping towards sustainable business: An evaluation of waste
   minimization practices in US manufacturing
SO INTERFACES

DE environment organizational studies; effectiveness; performance
ID RESOURCE-BASED VIEW
AB Central to the movement of organizations toward environmental sustainability is the financial viability and environmental effectiveness of the techniques for improving environmental performance. While waste-minimization practices (WMPs) have been touted as a key element in moving manufacturing organizations toward sustainability, we know little about their utilization and effectiveness across a range of industrial and organizational contexts. Using waste-minimization data collected as part of the Toxics Release Inventory, we studied 250 manufacturing firms to provide empirical evidence to enable plant managers to prioritize waste-minimization options. We found clear evidence of a corporate double bonus WMPs can provide through pollution reduction and enhanced operational efficiency relative to traditional end-of-pipe solutions. In the array of ecologically sustainable business practices, it appears that WMPs provide immediate environmental and operational benefits and build momentum for further steps toward environmentally sustainable economic development.

AB Recoverable manufacturing systems minimize the environmental impact of industry by reusing materials, reducing energy use, and reducing the need to landfill industrial products. These systems are widespread in the United States and are profitable, in addition to contributing to sustainable development. However, the management of supply-chain activities can differ greatly from management activities in traditional manufacturing supply chains. Seven complicating characteristics increase uncertainty. Managers must take actions to reduce uncertainty in the timing and quantity of returns, balance return rates with demand rates,;md make material recovery more predictable. Managers must also plan for the collection of products from end-users. The use of information systems with new production-planning and control techniques makes management of these activities more predictable.

AB Reverse logistics, a fairly new concept in logistics, has gained increasing importance as a profitable and sustainable business strategy. I describe a holistic view of reverse logistics and distill 11 insights for successful implementation of reverse logistics from the existing literature and published case studies. The strategic factors consist of strategic costs, overall quality, customer service, environmental concerns, and. legislative concerns. The operational factors consist of cost-benefit analysis, transportation, warehousing, supply management, remanufacturing and recycling, and packaging. Insights about these factors together form the state-of-the-art knowledge about the keys to successful design and use of reverse-logistics systems.

ID LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT
AB I use an actor-network perspective to analyze a case study of an environmentally sustainable, commercial textile fabric design. Susan Lyons of DesignTex, Inc., William McDonough of William McDonough and Partners, and Albin Kalin of Rohner Textil AG constructed and maintained a network of people and objects with an environmental focus by anticipating contingencies that continually threatened their network, such as waste disposal, credibility, and financial problems. In response to these contingencies, they developed and implemented environmental tools, such as an environmental design protocol, a life-cycle development (LCD) methodology, environmental cost accounting procedures, product-evaluation metrics, and employee-management systems. The success of their efforts rests on their ability to recruit network allies by integrating these environmental tools.

AB The case of Scandic Hotels shows, first, that sustainable strategies and practices can be just as useful in service operations as in manufacturing operations; and second, that such strategies and practices can support a corporate turnaround effort. Scandic Hotels, Nordic Europe's biggest hotel chain, was on the verge of collapse in the early 1990s. A new CEO, Roland Nilsson, turned the company around by introducing two business principles, decentralized management and sustainable development. The company's new value system, embodied in the concept of sustainability, linked customers and employees, who were calling for more environmental responsibility. Through employee-training programs, environmental-information systems, and innovative collaborations with suppliers, Scandic was revived within a few years as a profitable corporation well on the road to sustainability.

AB Walden Paddlers, a market leader in popularly priced recreational kayaks, used a simple, inexpensive guide to evaluate decisions against a parameter of environmental responsibility. This guide was applied across Walden's virtual corporation structure to yield quick innovations and economic, strategic, and environmental advantages. The guide enabled Walden and its network of partners to produce light, strong, inexpensive kayaks with superior performance characteristics made from 100-percent-recycled plastic, the only such kayaks on the market. Walden also employed the guide to create a nearly waste-free product-packaging-and-shipping system. Walden's decision guide succeeded within a network of collaborative alliances because it was applied comprehensively, it helped to clarify common goals, it created benefits for all participants, and it was implemented by a skilled entrepreneur-leader who coordinated decision making in the network.

AB Xerox's environmental strategic goal is to become a waste-free company. This ideal permeates the life cycle of Xerox products: waste-free products from waste-free factories for waste-free offices. Xerox has witnessed numerous benefits from implementing this strategy; by using design-for-the-environment principles, it has redesigned products and packaging to support product recovery and to reduce resource and energy consumption. Implementation of an end-of-life equipment take-back and reprocessing program led to savings of over $80 million in Europe in 1997, in addition to turning a potential disposal cost into a revenue stream. Through its environmental leadership program, Xerox has evolved a win-win-win scenario: improvements in environmental performance (win), customer satisfaction (win), and improved company performance (win).

AB We developed a new framework for defining sustainable forest management (SFM) based on the literature on environmental strategy and a field study of forest-product companies. We applied the framework to 21 forest-industry business cases and found that a comprehensive and effective SFM approach meshes operations with strategic purpose. When SFM practices were embedded in core strategy, rather than appended as a matter of ethics or social responsibility, companies realized competitive and business advantages as well as environmental and. social gains. Some firms have even begun to reinvent themselves as fiber-service companies as opposed to purely extractive forestry operations.

ID EDUCATION
AB An overarching concern of external agencies working in an educational context in developing countries is that of sustainability, that is, the degree to which change is embedded in practice once the agency has left. As consultants working with advisory teachers (ATs) in Lesotho our contention is that to be sustainable, change in ATs' practice should be a product of their thinking rather than an uncritical adoption of western practice. To understand the impact of our work on sustainability we developed an approach to evaluation which we termed 'envisioning'. It is suggested that the rationale underpinning envisioning explored in this paper will help agencies involved in similar work. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper examines bilateral double taxation treaties, with an emphasis on information exchange among tax authorities. A major objective is to understand which countries are more likely to sign a tax-relief treaty and when information-exchange clauses will be added to a treaty. A simple model with two asymmetric countries and repeated interactions among governments is used. The paper shows that no information exchange clause may be added to a tax treaty when there is a reciprocity requirement, when there is a high cost of negotiation, when there is a cost of providing information, or with one-way capital flows. It is also shown that an information clause increases the gains from a tax relief treaty, but may make it less sustainable.

TI Characterization of a collection of Aeschynomene histrix in subhumid

ID AFRICA; LIVESTOCK; LEGUMES
AB A collection of 64 accessions of the South American pasture legume Aeschynomene histrix Poiret was characterized in 1995 at Ibadan in south-west Nigeria in order to test the potential of the accessions as forage plants in subhumid areas and as a trap crop for the parasitic plant Striga hermonthica (Del.) Benth. All accessions had a low biomass production during the first s weeks after sowing but soon variations in the collection became apparent. Morphologically, accessions could be classified as having prostrate, decumbent, semi-erect and erect growth habit. The semi-erect to erect accessions grew vigorously and had high dry matter yields. The most frequent disease was Rhizoctonia foliar blight, for which, in general, prostrate accessions had a higher severity. In contrast, plants with semi-erect to erect growth habit were more susceptible to a wilting disease probably caused by Fusarium spp. With an average crude protein content of 16% and 48-h in sacco dry matter and protein digestibilities of c. 50%, fodder quality of 13-week-old plants was similar to that of other tropical forage legumes. As a result of a laboratory experiment to test the potential of A. histrix to act as a trap crop for Striga hermonthica, 13 accessions showing a significant influence on in vitro Striga hermonthica seed germination were identified. Twenty promising accessions were selected for further evaluation. These accessions showed good biomass production and/or high tolerance to diseases and/or significant influence on Striga hermonthica seed germination. Such material has the potential to contribute to both livestock-forage and improved fallow systems with the aim of increasing the sustainability of agricultural production in West Africa.

AB In industries populated by entrepreneurial high technology firms, the rapid development of new products is viewed as a key determinant of success. Developing a portfolio of new products is necessary to gain early cash flows, external visibility and legitimacy, early market share, and increase the likelihood of survival (Schoonhoven, Eisenhardt, and Lyman 1990). In addition, recent research has shown that new, product development improves a jinn's ability to, raise money through an initial public offering (Deeds, DeCarolis, and Coombs 1997).
   This paper develops a model of new product development which is rested on a sample of 94 pharmaceutical biotechnology companies. We hypothesize that new product development capabilities are a function of a firm's scientific, technological, and managerial skills. To test this relationship, we develop several firm specific measures in an attempt to triangulate in on the core construct affirm specific new product development capabilities.
   Some important implications for entrepreneurs/managers of high technology firms pawl from our results. First, entrepreneur/managers need to view the choice of geographic location as an important strategic decision which will impact their fir-in's access to the skilled technical personnel and the streams of knowledge. Our results indicate that a choice location has a significant concentration of similar firms, but the level has nor ver reached a point where competition for resources in the local environment offsets any advantages of the location. In the case of biotechnology this would seem to indicate that the prime locations would be expanding areas such as San Diego, Seattle and Philadelphia rather then the established locations of Silicon Valley and Boston.
   Second as scientific knowledge plays an elder more important role in a firm's success the quality of the firm's scientific team is a critical ingredient in a firm's new product development capability. But how do you evaluate the quality of scientific personnel? Our results indicate that there is a strong positive relationship between the impact-as measured by citations-of a team's prior research in the academic community and the productivity of that team bz a commercial research laboratory. Therefore, the judgement of a scientific field, captured by citations or perhaps ex-pert judgement, should prove to be a useful tool when evaluating personnel for a firm's research team.
   Third, the results from our. meastures of CEO experience and the percentage of rite tap management team with a Ph.D. are interesting As expected the prior experience of CEO in managing a commercial research facility enhances a firm's new product development capabilities. However; results for our top management team variable appears to indicate that the over reliance on technical personnel in the management of the organization detracts from the product development process. Taken together these results seem to imply that it is important that the leadership of the organization have knowledge of and experience in managing the new product development process, brit that diverting the firm's scientific personnel's energies away from the laboratory and into the management of the organization maybe counter-productive. Therefore, what a high technology venture appears to need is leadership that understands and has experience in the new produce development process, but which is separate and distinct from the scientific team. This type of leadership keeps the scientific team focused on research and development, and out of the boardroom (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Inc.

AB Communities are at many different stages of readiness for implementing programs, and this readiness is to be a major factor in determining whether a local program can be effectively implemented and supported by the community. The Community Readiness Model was developed to meet research needs, (e.g., matching treatment and control communities for an experimental intervention) as well as to provide a practical tool to help communities mobile for change. The model defines nine stages of community readiness ranging from "no awareness" of the problem to "professionalization" in the response to the problem within the community. Assessment of the stage of readiness is accomplished using hey informant interviews, with questions on six different dimensions related to a community's readiness to mobilize to address a specific issue. Based on experiences in working directly with communities, strategies for successful effort implementation have been developed for each stage of readiness. Once a community has achieved a stage of readiness where focal efforts can be initiated, community teams can be trained in use of the community readiness model. These teams can then develop specific, culturally appropriate efforts that use local resources to guide the community to more advanced lec,els of readiness, eventually leading to long-term sustainability of local community efforts. This article presents the history of the development of the model, the stages of readiness, dimensions used to assess readiness, how readiness is assessed and strategies for change at each level of readiness.

AB Program sustainability requires grantees to be service providers, evaluators, and fundraisers. State agencies support programs that enhance state priorities and systems, are community driven, are high quality, have ongoing evaluation and strong management and fiscal practices. Sustainable programs are of reasonable cost and have the potential for replication, modification to meet changing community needs, and providing technology transfer and other by products. Planning includes identifying potential funders, developing funding goals, objectives, strategies, and timelines, marketing, providing technical assistance, and performing cost-benefit analysis. Federal agencies should involve states in planning future federal grants and require grantees to begin sustainability planning in year one. Programs not receiving renewed funding have ethical responsibilities to participants, agency staff and the community when services end. (C) 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

   AGROECOSYSTEMS; DEFINITION; MANAGEMENT; NITRATE; GROWTH
AB As part of an environmental monitoring and assessment effort, we developed a conceptual model for measuring and assessing the condition and sustainability of agroecosystems. An agroecosystem is a field, pasture, or orchard and the associated border areas. We focused on ecological sustainability and defined the goals for agroecosystems in terms of the values people place on them. The purpose of an agroecosystem is to produce food and fiber. Other desired outcomes can be considered as goals for the larger landscape and the rest of the world, and they sometimes function as constraints on production. Condition is defined by agroecosystem productivity and the degree to which farmers use management and stewardship practices that conserve and protect valued natural resources in the landscape and the rest of the world. An agoecosystem in good condition is productive and is managed to conserve valued resources. Sustainability is the maintenance of good condition over time. We developed indicators that link system condition and sustainability to societal values and goals. These indicators measure productivity, management practices that promote sustainability at the agroecosystem scale, and management practices that promote sustainability at landscape and global scales. Our initial efforts focused on annually harvested herbaceous crops; however, the concepts we used can be adapted to other plant and livestock systems. Our conceptual approach may be used to evaluate the effectiveness of several major programs now being implemented, including the USDA's Environmental Quality Incentive and Conservation Reserve Programs.

SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY

DT Article
ID CONTERMINOUS UNITED-STATES; SYSTEMS
AB Indicators of the condition and sustainability of agricultural lands covering 5.5 million ha in six mid-Atlantic states were measured in 1994 and 1995. The primary objective was to collect baseline information against which future data from the region ran be compared. Soil samples and questionnaire data were collected from a random sample of 293 sites. Indicators addressed productivity, management at the agroecosystem scale, and management for the landscape scale on annual crop land. Crop yields were almost 30% higher than those of the 1980s, with a mean observed to expected yield index of 1.27. The mean soil quality index showed moderate quality for supporting plant growth. Non-tilled sites, which were mostly hay, had greater microbial biomass than tilled sites. Just over half of the annual crop land was covered by rotation plans; hay fields accounted for most of the land where one crop was grown continuously. Hay showed a lower use of applied nitrogen than seed crops. Integrated pest management was practiced on less than 20% of annual crop land. Twenty-seven different annual crops were grown in the region, with hay (all types) the dominant crop. Less than 20% of the land where pesticides were applied had high to moderately high potential for pesticides leaching into ground water. This information provides a baseline for long-term monitoring of agricultural lands in the region.

TI Salinity, boron, and irrigated pecan productivity along New Mexico's Rio
   Grande basin
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY

ID SEEDLINGS; GROWTH; ROOTSTOCKS; TOXICITY; FRUIT
AB We surveyed 15 commercial irrigated orchards of 'Western' pecan [Carya illinoinensis (Wangenh.) K. Koch] along a 120-km stretch of the middle Rio Grande basin in southern New Mexico. Our intent was to determine if high salinity and boron (B) broadly threaten pecan cultivation in this region. Ten of the fifteen sites were found to be on soils considered too saline for pecan trees (>2-3 dS m(-1) in the soil saturation extract of the upper 0-60 cm of soil depth). Of these 10 sites, 4 had saturation extract Na concentration exceeding 20 mM, which is at or about the concentration corresponding to pecan seedling rootstock growth suppression. A laboratory study showed that cell membranes of excised, subapical seedling root segments from 'River-side' pecan were damaged by about twice the salinity of the saturation extract at the highest salinity sites (9 dS m(-1)). At all sites, midsummer leaflet B concentration surpassed the published accepted range for pecan of about 50 to 100 mg B kg(-1) dry weight, especially at the sites with higher soil salinity. Evaluation of two nearby sites (low salinity and B and high salinity and B orchards) showed that the higher salinity and B were associated with 25% lower yield efficiency, 3% lower percentage kernel, 13% lower mass per nut, and a 9 to 16% reduction in the tree's capacity to recycle N and P into perennial storage organs. The findings bring attention to the sustainability of current irrigation and soil management practices in much of this concentrated pecan producing region.

TI Reforestation rules in Oregon - Lessons learned from strict enforcement
SO JOURNAL OF FORESTRY

DT Article
ID FORESTRY
AB Oregon's reforestation rules are among the strictest in the United States; reforestation must take place within two seasons of harvest and the seedlings must be "free to grow" by the end of the sixth year. As the nation seeks to obtain more wood from fewer and fewer acres in a sustainable manner, the need to ensure compliance with state reforestation rules will become more critical. The situation in Oregon may offer some lessons.

AB Global primary energy consumption amounts to 8.38 billion tonnes oil equivalent (OE) (1996) and is projected to increase by 1.3% per year for the industrialized countries and by up to 9.2% per year for the developing countries. Fossil energy's share was 7.541 billion tonnes OE in 1996 with rising tendency. The order of magnitude of proved reserves of fossil energy sources is 950 billion tonnes OE (1996), and certain present probable and possible reserves will become proved ones in the years to come. Fossil energy will, therefore, remain the number one energy source until far into the next century. The use of fossil energy produced 23.8 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) in 1996 with oil and gas contributing about 60% to this figure. It is estimated that continued use of fossil energy will lead to an increase of the average global temperature by 1.0-3.5 degrees C in the coming 50-100 years. Though the forecasts of future CO2 emissions from fossil energy use as well as the magnitude of their influence on global warming are much disputed, the impact of CO2-emissions on global warming itself is widely admitted. There is much dissense on the climatic consequences of global warming. It cannot be ruled out, however, that these consequences may be detrimental to mankind. This has in a sense of a "no regret policy" triggered substantial activity worldwide to decrease emission of greenhouse gases, especially of CO2, and various attempts have been made to set binding limits for the emission of these gases. The harmonized worldwide implementation of CO2-reduction strategies is, however, far from being realized. OECD-countries have made substantial progress in applying these strategies. Nevertheless, the contribution of the industrialized countries to worldwide GO-emissions is still over-proportionally large. The cost of developing and applying CO2-reduction technologies are tremendous and prohibitive for most of the emerging economies. There is an obligation of the industrialized countries in their own interest to develop and make available these technologies wherever they are needed. The cost/efficiency ratio of CO2-reduction measures must be a decisive criterion for their application. There are serious obstacles, though, to reducing CO2-emissions while satisfying the energy needs of our world, e.g. lacking international harmonization, national needs and egoisms, rapid growth of world population and strongly increasing energy demand of emerging economies. In summing up, though an anthropogenic contribution to global warming cannot be proved for the time bring, it cannot be ruled out forever. Therefore, internationally harmonized measures for CO2-reduction have to be taken in the sense of a "no regret policy" to avert potential damage from mankind and, thus, contribute in this sense to a sustainable development with fossil energy.

AB The ability to create a stream of revolutionary new products can represent a sustainable competitive advantage for firms in almost arty industry. Whereas evolutionary product improvements often follow predictable trajectories, breakthrough innovations involve unexpected leaps of creativity and insight. Despite its strategic importance, however; little is known about the process by which innovators achieve these valuable breakthroughs. This article proposes that break through innovations result from the harnessing of tacit knowledge possessed by individuals and project teams. Tacit knowledge lies below the surface of conscious thought and is accumulated through a lifetime of experience, experimentation, perception, and learning by doing. Managers who can tap into this vast pool of creative energy can elevate the innovative capabilities of their teams well beyond the incremental and mundane.
   The article begins by establishing the vital importance of breakthrough innovations to the competitiveness of firms. This strategic mandate is followed by a brief discussion of the nature and implications of tacit knowledge in the context of innovation The remainder of the article describes three mutually reinforcing methods for encouraging the explication and sharing of tacit knowledge among design team members. The ultimate goal is to establish a generative atmosphere for breakthrough innovation in which divergent thinking, improvisation, and artistic creativity merge with the practical demands of the product development process.
   The first step toward harnessing the creative power of tacit knowledge is to foster the emotional commitment and deep personal involvement of design team members. Managers can accomplish this goal through the development of inspiring "innovation stories, " encouragement of reasonable risk-taking and experimentation, building of unique team identities, and displaying unbridled confidence in a team's creative abilities. Once the emotional commitment of team members has been assured, two techniques are proposed as catalysts for breakthroughs derived from tacit knowledge. These methods are based on evidence that intimate physical interaction during the creative process, both person to object mid person to person, may be a catalyst for tacit insights. The first technique highlights the use of early and frequent prototyping as a powerful focal point for the explication of tacit knowledge from both the design team and potential customers. The second technique involves the encouragement of face-to-face interaction between innovators during product development, thereby enabling creative improvisation and real-time knowledge sharing.
   Several implications for managers are highlighted including the need for a greater emphasis on employee retention, the importance of developing a nurturing environment for innovation, and the value of intimate physical interaction, including early prototyping, indwelling with customers, and co-location of teams wherever possible.

AB Significant growth and improvement of school mental health programs has occurred in recent years. However, evaluation of outcomes for children receiving these services is needed to provide accountability data and ensure the sustainability of these programs. When designing studies, evaluators must overcome several challenges that may threaten the validity of their conclusions. In this paper, threats or challenges to the internal and external validity of results from evaluation studies are reviewed. Suggestions are provided for overcoming these challenges, in order to encourage future evaluation activities in this developing field and to document the impact of services for services for youth and their families.

ID MODEL
AB One of the major challenges facing the world today is defining paths to sustainable futures. Part of the challenge is developing a national energy strategy that promotes an adequate energy supply for the United States, while enhancing environmental quality and maintaining U.S. competitiveness in the world economy. To assist in this challenge, we have developed a screening technique to analyze the effectiveness of different proposed emissions reduction strategies. The technique, referred to as the visibility assessment screening technique (VAST), is designed to examine possible impacts on visibility of emission changes of sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides, volatile organic compounds (i.e., SO2, NOx, and VOC) and fine and coarse particulate matter (PM). The influence of relative humidity, natural aerosols, and the chemical interconnections among sulfur and nitrogen components of aerosols in determining the effectiveness of Clean Air Act Amendment and other projected energy-related emissions changes on eastern and western visibility are explored. The effectiveness of these strategies on particulate matter impacts and potentially on ozone is also noted.

TI Bankers' perspective of mining project finance
SO JOURNAL OF THE SOUTH AFRICAN INSTITUTE OF MINING AND METALLURGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Since the dismal performance of the Rand Mines management was called to account by its shareholders in 1994, the waves of change have continued to ripple across the South African mining industry. The number of listings on the gold board of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, that once numbered 40 or 50-odd, have now dwindled to no more than a handful as unprecedented restructuring has taken place. The redefining of the industry has not been limited to the gold sector, but across the base metal coal, diamond, platinum and industrial mineral sectors as well.
   At the same time the Mining Houses began to reconsider their funding strategies. Originally established in the early part of the century to ensure the long-term sustainability of their group mining operations by providing substantial financial muscle and technical support, the Mining Houses were faced with a-rapidly changing political environment, which proved to be a critical catalyst in giving momentum to the change. Furthermore, the significant development costs and increasing risk profile for new projects, coupled with pressure From shareholders demanding respectable returns, opened Be door to opportunities for banks to begin providing external debt by the way of project finance. However, the provision of long-term debt to Be South African mining industry had generally not been common since mining : companies had financed new projects with equity, or with the cash flows from existing operations.
   Those banks that had the appetite for exposure. to the perceived high risks of the mining sector rapidly built up Specialist resource banking: divisions capable of addressing the increasing demands of the industry. The application of project finance, the principles of which were developed in the 1970s specifically for infrastructure projects and privatization, is now commonly applied-in the financing of greenfield and brownfield mining projects.
   This paper outlines the approach,that lending banks would typically adopt when arranging or providing mining project finance, their usual areas of concern and the way in which the finance is : : structured to mitigate the many inherent risks.

AB The impact of different logging techniques on nutrient losses in burnt eucalyptus and pine forests in northern Portugal was investigated. A variety of logging techniques is used in the region resulting in varying amounts of slash debris on the slopes. The efficacy of this litter in reducing soil erosion is well established but less is known about the impact on nutrient losses. Small bounded plots were used to examine the impact of varying amounts of slash debris and pine-needle cover on nutrient losses in overland flow and adsorbed to eroded sediment over 19 months during the first two-three years after fire. Nutrient losses in solution and adsorbed to eroded sediment were substantially higher on burnt terrain due to increased erosion and overland flow generation and high nutrient concentrations at the soil surface in the burned forests. Post-fire logging techniques in eucalyptus forests resulting in large amounts of litter debris on the slopes are effective at reducing eroded sediment nutrient losses but less effective at reducing losses in solution. In pine forests, litter is largely ineffective in reducing solute and sediment nutrient losses. However, a covering of pine needles was shown to be highly effective in reducing eroded sediment nutrient losses and to a lesser extent solute losses. Conservational methods of logging are suggested for both eucalyptus and pine forests in the region. In the absence of such measures, the sustainability of short-rotation eucalyptus forestry is questioned in northern Portugal. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

ID SPECIAL ISSUE
AB The trends are world wide: people and goods are increasingly mobile, compact cities develop into urban networks, industrialising agriculture is becoming footloose, rural life becomes urban life in a green setting. Social segregation, traffic nuisance, urban sprawl and other unwanted impacts of these trends challenge urban and regional planners. The search for planning answers to these issues is further complicated by the need for sustainable development at a global scale. What is the role of ecology in the context of the discussions on the future of town and country? The traditional, and still dominant, approach is based on the polarity of urban and rural worlds. In this perspective, ecology focuses on the 'nature' of protected areas and biodiversity. The papers in this special issue explore the prospects of a wider perspective in which natural processes are seen as basic to both, rural and urban development. This article is digging up the fundamental 'discourses' underlying the two approaches to ecology and nature. Firstly, the 'object-oriented' and 'process-oriented' discourses are analysed. Secondly, the prospects of a process-oriented discourse are illustrated with plans for the Dutch Randstad and the German Ruhr area. Then, some new concepts are introduced that may strengthen the institutional conditions for the process-oriented approach. Discourses, concepts, plans and projects all circle around the central question in this article about the role of ecology in planning the edge of the city. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

DE rural lifestyle estates; landscape parks; National Ecological Network
AB Recent studies tend to indicate that no longer all presently agricultural land in The Netherlands is required for sustainable agricultural production. Apart from various urban uses and some projects turning agricultural land into nature reserves or giving it a secondary function, like national landscape parks or drinking water supply area, it is not easy to find alternative users for the land presently managed by farmers. At the same time, many urban companies or families are vainly looking for building lots away from our 'compact urban areas'. This paper explores a way to bring this supply and demand together in a landscape-wise more than acceptable manner: the planning concept and experiment of 'new rural lifestyle estates'.

TI Infrastructure networks and red-green patterns in city regions
SO LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING
LA English
DT Article
DE infrastructure; landscape; history; urbanisation; spatial planning
AB Landscape ecology challenges the urbanisation processes and the activities of the infrastructure sectors. Infrastructure networks have a strong impact on the development of cities and landscapes. This impact is often positive in an economic sense but can be negative in respect of natural or recreational functions of city and countryside. The challenge for spatial planning is to locate infrastructure lines in order to safeguard the conditions for the less dynamic functions in and around the urban regions. This paper analyses the impact of network patterns on urban development patterns and on green patterns, taking the history of the Randstad Holland as an example. In history the central peat area of this region was hardly accessible. This fact has led over the course of time to a unique spatial pattern: the major infrastructure lines and the major urban settlements are situated on the rim of a Green Heart. This creates a high-quality setting for the economy and the urbanisation of more than 6 million people as well as for natural and agricultural functions. Such a combination of urban elements and infrastructure around a green core can also be found on other scale levels and in other regions. Constraints on access often correlate with restricted urbanisation and with a sustainable position for the green elements. In those cases that such a restraint is chosen deliberately, often five phenomena are visible: (1) Polarity: a spatial polarity between less dynamic and more dynamic functions. (2) Decentrality: a side position of the main infrastructure and urban centres and a central position for the green functions. (3) Equality: equilibrium in extension of urban and rural elements. (4) Continuity: the green areas are part of larger scale networks. (5) Formality: planning policies couple the planning of infrastructure and dynamic urban activities to the development of the less dynamic, green functions.
   Together, these five elements create a special approach of spatial planning that can be applied on various scales. It is possible to use these elements as a concept, a design tool to create sustainable conditions for the 'green' functions in and around city regions. Based on some examples, suggestions are made for a strategy for urban-rural (re-)development aiming at high-quality urban life and for the natural environment, in and around urban regions. Sustainable spatial patterns demand a planning approach that combines the planning of infrastructure and urban activities with the planning of their green counterpoint. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB The International Whaling Commission verges on extinction because of disagreement between those who support sustainable whaling subject to scientifically based regulation and those who assert that no commercial whaling should be allowed despite scientific findings that some whale stocks can sustain regulated commercial harvests. This article reviews legal, political, biological and cultural components of whaling and suggests a simple approach that will correct the present untenable situation, allow sustainable use of an abundant food resource critical to many communities' well-being, and continue protection afforded to stocks of great whales that were severely overfished in the past.

AB This paper proposes the Natural Resource Region (NRR) as a policy tool for the management of total capital flows and interactions with Large Marine Ecosystems (LMEs). The NRR is conceptualized as a network of Natural Resource Communities bound together by total capital flows and dependent on the marine resources of adjacent LMEs. The NRR is illustrated with a case study of the New England multispecies groundfish fishery, showing how ignorance by managers of tolal capital components (i.e. social, economic, cultural, human, biophysical) significantly destabilized the fishery. A NRR approach to marine policy and management is anticipated to improve the sustainability of both natural resources and natural-resource dependent communities. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

TI A boon for mountain populations - Large cardamom framing in the Sikkim
   Himalaya
SO MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID NUTRIENT
AB Farming and tourism are the primary livelihood options for mountain people in the Hindu Kush-Himalayan region. Tourism in Sikkim, a small Indian state in the eastern Himalaya, has become popular only since 1990; the main focus is on ecotourism. Only a small segment of the population is engaged in this sector, however. More than 80% of the population depends on agriculture. The developmental measures of the "green revolution" implemented in other Indian states were not successful in the Himalayan region because adequate fertilizers were never available on time, irrigation could not be developed, and soils are very fragile. Population growth and consequent fragmentation of farmland in Sikkim have caused a reduction in per capita holdings. This has forced farmers to cultivate cash crops such as potatoes (Solanum tuberosum), ginger (Zingiber officinale), and mandarin oranges (Citrus reticulate). The latter two have caused rapid nutrient depletion of the soil. Production of another cash crop, large cardamom (Amomum subulatum), a plant native to the Sikkim Himalaya, has been a boon to the mountain people of the area. Large cardamom is a perennial cash crop grown beneath the forest cover on marginal lands. Its cultivation is an example of how a local mountain niche can be exploited sustainably.

AB This paper surveys some major questions on the evolution of eight piscivorous Barbus species (B. acutirostris, B. dainellii, B. gorguari, B. longissimus, B, megastoma, B. platydorsus, B. truttiformis, and B. macrophtalmus), which together with six other species compose the endemic hexaploid 'large barb' species flock of Lake Tana. Preliminary data suggest that the major prey species of these piscivores (up to 90 cm length), in contrast to previous reports, is not Barbus trispilopleura, but at least two other diploid small barb' species (10 < cm). Data are collected from 1) the resource partitioning of the piscivores in the field, 2) aquarium experiments on the predator success in catching different prey species and size classes, 3) analyses on allometric growth and diet shifts in the field and 3) molecular genetic data, which will be combined to construct a hypothesis on the process of the evolution of these piscivorous barbs. Being the major target of commercial fisheries, knowledge on these piscivorous fish stocks and their prey species is required for aiming at sustainable fisheries. preliminary data show a serious decline of fish stocks, most probably largely due to overexploiting their spawning grounds.

AB Using a scientific assessment concept of sustainability in crop-production based on the entropy production minimization principle of thermodynamics, formation and non-use of soluble and volatile (by-)products of the nutrient cycles within the system are interpreted as indicators or measures of the low efficiency/sustainability of recent forms of intensive agriculture. The simultaneous high energy input in modern crop production systems further shows the difference between these and quasi-stationary natural systems with maximum bioproduction having minimum energy dissipation and entropy production. Using balance sheets and dynamic approaches, the practical implications regarding the nitrogen cycle in central Europe (FR Germany) and China are exemplified and discussed. The average N balance of arable systems in Germany shows surplus N amounts of 110-130 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1). A high N immobilization in accordance with deepened top soil layers has governed N balances in Germany since about 1960. In China Nbalance surpluses in intensive agricultural (double-cropping) systems on the southern edge of the Loess Plateau now reach 125-230 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1). In field experiments, mineral N contents in the profiles (0-1.2 m depth) were 72-342 and 78-108 kg ha(-1) at harvest of summer maize and winter wheat, respectively. In the Taihu region in eastern China, surpluses in the N balance (rice-wheat double cropping) amount to 217-335 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1). N-min contents in the 0-0.9 m profiles of between 50 and 100 kg N ha(-1) were frequently found after winter wheat harvest. In two separate investigations of ground and well water samples in China, nitrate contents exceeded the critical WHO value for drinking water in 38-50% of the locations investigated.

AB School academic performance was compared among primary school pupils of different nutritional and health status in Nsukka, Enugu State of Nigeria after a simple random sampling selection of participant pupils and retrospective assessment of their health and nutritional history dating back to their gestation periods. Mothers and guardians of the pupils supplied information on their health and nutritional history through a well structured self administered questionnaire. Two hundred and eighty five (73.1%) of the pupils selected, participated in the final studies. There was predominance of malnutrition among the pupils. Only 28.9% of the pupils were of normal weight for height (using Z-scores on Nutritional Centre for Health Statistics Values). 47.1% were mildly underweight, 20.1% were moderately underweight while 4.0% were severely underweight. Overall nutritional status (using weight-for-age Z-scores) significantly affects school performance (p<0.05). Only 26.0% of the pupils were of normal height-for-age, the rest were stunted. Complications for pregnancy was found to significantly affect later school performance (p<0.05). Birth complications also significantly affected later school performance (p<0.05). There was no significant association between duration of breast feeding and later school performance (p>0.05). Of the social factors that influence health and nutrition, level of maternal education was found to have a significant effect on school performance of pupils (p<0.05). Prenatal and postnatal conditions were found to affect school performance of children. Sustainable human development will therefore start with effective education of women which will produce a multiplier effect on succeeding generations. Investment in female education is an effective means of improving the quality of children, their school performance and their future performance and quality of life in adulthood.

AB This paper introduces a new unit root test, using 'Feedback Covariates', in order to test for sustainability of fiscal policy within the G-7. Non-sustainability is considered as the null response to inherited debt. We characterize the distribution of the FADF (Feedback Augmented Dickey-Fuller) statistics under both the null and the near unit root alternative and we compare the FADF statistics with the ones related to single equation approaches. This test is applied to public debt normalized by GDP, rather than by a discount factor, consistently with a definition of effective sustainability, which focusses on policy implications. We are still unable to reject the null hypothesis of non-sustainability for four countries. Nevertheless, our results confirms the potential of our approach in terms of power gains and shows that standard unit root tests leads to accept too often the null hypothesis of non-stationarity.

TI Debt and deficit ceilings, and sustainability of fiscal policies: An
   intertemporal analysis
SO OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS
LA English
DT Article
ID BUDGET CONSTRAINT
AB In this paper we examine the likely consequences for the sustainability of fiscal policy of pursuing goals that rely on restictive ceilings on deficits and debt. We provide a formal theoretical framework for analyzing the sustainability of fiscal policy based on the government intertemporal budget constraint and derive conditions that determine whether a given fiscal stance is sustainable. This framework generalizes the existing literature in several important respects. We allow for time-varying interest rates, for feedback from debt to the primary deficit, for a finite planning horizon suitable for medium-term policy making, for possible future policy shifts, we show how published forecasts can be used and we provide a measure of fiscal pressure. We then apply this analysis to the fiscal positions of the United States and the European Union countries since 1970 and to their planned positions over the next decade.
   We find that many countries do not have a sustainable policy. The evidence in favour of sustainablitly is strengthened for most countries when the data are extended to incorporate future fiscal consolidation plans, reflecting the general shift toward fiscal austerity in recent years. In contrast, with a finite horizon we show that the recent policy shift made the paths of future policies sustainable. However, imposing ceilings on debt or deficit-to-GDP ratios throws most economies onto an intertemporally inconsistent path unless governments undertake a major tax or expenditure adjustment. High-debt countries can satisfy debt rules only by raising (reducing) the average tax (spending) rate substantially for five years. A deficit ceiling puts an increasingly high pressure on most economies, including the United States, requiring a gradual rise (decline) in the tax (spending) rate. We conclude therefore that imposing debt or deficit ceilings could lead to fiscal policy becoming a difficult political choice.

AB Long-term demographic data have been analyzed to establish possible costs of flowering in the terrestrial orchid Spiranthes spiralis (L.) Chevall. in The Netherlands. Costs of flowering can be expressed as individual plant performance and flowering frequency in relation to the generative or vegetative status in the following year. Flowering in individuals of S. spiralis in a given year (t) is followed by a non-flowering phase in the next growing season (t + 1) in more than 80% of the plants. The decline in flowering frequency is not a result of the age structure of the population involved because individual plants do not show signs of senescence after 10-15 years of aerial presence as an autotrophic plant. Rosettes have a smaller leaf area in the year of flowering (t), compared to the previous (t - 1) and following year (t + 1), due to the allocation of the limited underground resources to both flowering stake and rosette at the beginning of its growing season. Generative reproduction in S. spiralis has a significant negative impact an both flowering frequency in subsequent years and on rosette size in the year of flowering. The flowering frequency and rosette size in relation to the life history, characterized by the yearly replacement of the underground tuber, is discussed. Better understanding of the life-history strategy, including costs of reproduction, may contribute to the creation of sustainable environmental conditions for growth of S. spiralis, e.g., optimal conditions for photosynthesis during the aboveground stage of the tiny wintergreen rosettes.

TI Reactions in the annual Medicago core germ plasm collection to two
   isolates of Peronospora trifoliorum from alfalfa
SO PLANT DISEASE
LA English
DT Article
AB Peronospora trifoliorum causes downy mildew of alfalfa throughout the temperate regions of the world, but little is known about its host range within the annual Medicago species (medics). Several medics have characteristics potentially beneficial to sustainable agriculture programs and to the genetic improvement of alfalfa. Therefore, we evaluated resistance in 199 accessions representing 33 species of the annual Medicago core germ plasm collection to P. trifoliorum isolates 17 and 18 from alfalfa from Kansas and southern California, respectively. Seedlings at the cotyledonary growth stage were inoculated with conidia suspended in water. One week later, the plants were rated resistant (no conidium production) or susceptible (conidium production). High levels of resistance existed in all species. All plants in 142 (71%) of the accessions were resistant to both isolates, but plants in only 24 of those resistant accessions were free of chlorotic to necrotic hypersensitive reactions on the inoculated cotyledons. All but one of the medic accessions had a higher percentage of plants resistant to both isolates than did cv. Saranac alfalfa, the resistant control. Conidium production generally was much less intense on the susceptible medic plants than on the alfalfa controls. A greater percentage of plants in four medic accessions was more resistant to 18 than to 17, and 22 were more resistant to 17 than to 18.

AB Despite widespread evidence of bribery and illegal exchange in natural resource management, corruption is largely unexplored and unincorporated in theorizations and descriptions of the political economy of environment/society interactions. This paper offers the outlines of a theory of natural resource corruption, defining it as a special case of extra-legal resource management institutions, exploring the challenge corruption poses for sustainable use of natural systems, and providing an example of corruption in the case of forest management in India. I argue here that corruption is an institutionalized system of nature/society interaction forged from state authority and molded around local social power through systems of social capital formation. I further suggest that corruption though unsustainable, is not environmentally destructive in a general sense, but that it instead puts selective pressure on some elements of a natural system while bypassing others. The argument addresses not only the character of corruption but also the role of institutions in mediating the relationships between the state and civil society, mon generally, (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

DE childhood; poverty; food budget standards; UK food policy options
ID DISEASE
AB One in three children in Britain lives in poverty (households whose income was less than 50 % average earnings). Low income is associated with poor nutrition at all stages of life, from lower rates of breast-feeding to higher intakes of saturated fatty acids and lower intakes of antioxidant nutrients. Moreover, there is increasing evidence that poor nutrition in childhood is associated with both short-term and long-term adverse consequences such as poorer immune status, higher caries rates and poorer cognitive function and learning ability. These problems arise primarily because parents do not have enough money to spend on food, not because money is being spent unwisely. Policy options to improve the dietary health of poor children include: giving more money to the parents by increasing Income Support (social security) payments, providing food stamps or vouchers, and using food budget standards to inform the levels of income needed to purchase an adequate diet; feeding children directly at school (not only at lunchtime but also at breakfast or homework clubs), by providing free fruit at school, and by increasing entitlement to free food amongst children living in households with low incomes; improving access to a healthy and affordable diet by first identifying 'food deserts' and then considering with retailers and local planners how best to provide food in an economical and sustainable way. The value of using food budget standards is illustrated with data relating expenditure on food to growth in children from 'at-risk' families (on low income, overcrowded, headed by a lone parent or with four or more children under 16 years of age) living in a poor area in London. Lower levels of expenditure are strongly associated with poorer growth and health, independent of factors such as birth weight, mother's height, or risk score. The present paper provides evidence that supports the need to review Government legislation in light of nutrition-related inequalities in the health of children.

DT Article

ID RAINFALL; ENGLAND; DROUGHT
AB This paper examines evidence for the occurrence and causes of low flows, and strategies for their mitigation, in two regulated, chalk-fed streams. The rivers occupy adjacent catchments of similar topography, have long histories of water exploitation and land-use change, and are subject to conflicting demands of water resource development and increased pressure for environmental improvement. In one case, a strategy of low-flow mitigation based upon reduced groundwater abstraction has been proposed. Although flows are shown to be declining through time, and low flows are more common over the last decade, analysis of rainfall records and groundwater levels produce inconclusive evidence for the causes of low flows. Despite their natural similarities, the catchments are shown to have very different sensitivities to low flow. When concentrating upon quantity of low flow, the River Gade appears to be most compromised, but when consideration is taken of water quality, the Bulbourne is more severely affected. An examination of catchment changes over a longer time period provides the best rationale for these sensitivities and contrasts. The study illustrates the potential danger of starting with a solely climatic-hydrological perspective to low flows which then progresses to a hydrological 'solution'. Consideration of catchment land-use history, and of the importance of water quality, suggest limited applicability of reduced abstraction in mitigating low-flow problems in these kinds of environments. The study reinforces calls for further studies of groundwater-surface water interaction as essential inputs to appropriate and sustainable water resource management strategies.

AB This study was carried out to assess the nutrient status of soils formed on biotite-granites on the Jos Plateau and to recommend management practices that can help to enhance and sustain the agricultural productivity of the soils. Twenty-three soil profile pits were dug and carefully studied in the area and soil samples collected were analysed for their physical and chemical properties. The results show that the soils are characterised by low to very low total nitrogen status, available phosphorus deficiency and low to very low calcium. Exchangeable potassium, magnesium and micronutrient elements (Cu, Zn and B) deficiencies do occur but their deficiencies are not general. Some of these problems can be traced to erosion, leaching, crop removal and the acidic and lateritic nature of most of the soils. Enhancement and sustenance of soil nutrient status for sustainable agriculture call for an integrated management package involving measures to minimize erosion and improve the nutrient status of the soils. This means that the farmers have to modify their present soil management practices. The need also arises for the government to embark upon realistic and stable measures that can help in enhancing the fertility of this category of soils nation-wide for sustainable agricultural productivity. Policy makers need to come up with strategic plans involving uninterrupted investments and work in partnership with the farmers through their appropriate agents. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Background: It has been proved that there is an inspiratory muscle dysfunction in mitral stenosis; Although its causes still remain unknown. Aim: to evaluate the effect of percutaneous balloon mitral valvuloplasty (PMV) on inspiratory muscle performance (IMP) in patients with mitral stenosis (mitral area < 1.5 cm(2)). Patients and methods: We studied IMP in 8 patients (35 +/- 10 years) before and 3 months after successful PMV. Inspiratory muscle strength was studied by measuring maximal statistical inspiratory mouth pressure (MIP). Endurance was evaluated using a two minute incremental threshold loading test in order to obtain the maximal sustainable inspiratory pressure (SIP), with the maximal sustainable load (MSL) the patients could sustain for 2 minutes. Results: Mitral valvuloplasty increased mean cardiac index from 3.1 +/- 0.3 to 4.15 +/- 0.3 l/min/m(2) (p<0.01), and significantly decreased mean pulmonary and capillary pressures. The MIP value (118 +/- 6 cmH(2)O), similar to that of normal group, increased to 137 +/- 7 cmH(2)O (p<0.01). SIP and maximal sustainable load were 52 +/- 2 cmH(2)O and 294 +/- 29 g respectively, lower than normal subjects (p<0.05). They increased after PMV to 80 +/- 3 cmH(2)O and 463 +/- 26 g respectively (p<0.001). Conclusions: PMV improved inspiratory muscle function in patients with severe mitral stenosis, probably secondary to a decrease work of breath and improvement of ventricular function.

AB This study was conducted in an area of Brazil cultivated with soybean since the early 1960's but which for the last 17 yr was under different tillage (no-tillage, NT; conventional tillage, CT) and crop rotation (soybean, S/wheat, W/maize, M; S/W; M/W) systems. The area had not received any inoculant for the last 15 yr and our objective was to investigate the effects of tillage and cropping systems on the bradyrhizobia population. The NT system and crop rotations with soybean resulted in high populations of bradyrhizobia, but even in the treatment where soybean had not been cultivated for 17 yr (M/W) the number of viable cells in the soil was high. A total of 142 bradyrhizobia isolated from the different treatments were characterized based on colony morphology, serological reaction, DNA analysis by RAPD, protein and Nod factors profiles. The analyses resulted in grouping of the isolates into 16 DNA, five protein and three Nod factors profiles. A high proportion (37.5%) of the isolates did not react with any known serogroup. Both NT and crop rotations with soybean resulted in a higher bradyrhizobia diversity, with the lowest number of genomic patterns occurring in the CT with M/W rotation. However, there was no relationship between the treatment combinations and genetic relatedness. The evaluation of symbiotic performance under greenhouse conditions showed that the isolates with higher rates of Nz fixation were also isolated from NT with S/W or S/W/M crop rotations. Consequently, the use of agronomic practices such as NT and crop rotation with legumes will not only contribute to agricultural sustainability, but also help to maintain bradyrhizobia population and diversity.

AB Soil compactibility which basically depends on soil texture, organic matter and soil water content during farm machinery trafficking an major factors affecting soil conservation. In a field experiment, cattle farmyard manure was applied to a silty clay loam soil (fine-loamy, mixed, thermic Typic Haplargids, USDA; Calcaric Cambisols, FAO in Isfahan, Iran. Three rates, 0, 50, 100 Mg ha(-1) ton oven dry basis) of farmyard manure, were incorporated into the topsoil. After 5 months, a two-wheel drive tractor (48.5 kW) was passed over the plots once (P1) or twice (P2) at soil moisture contents associated with the plastic limit (PL), 0.8PL, and 0.6PL. A randomized complete block design with four replicates with treatments nested (split-block) into the blocks was used. Bulk density (BD), cone index (CI) and soil sinkage were measured as indices of soil compactibility and trafficability. Applying 50 and 100 Mg ha(-1) of manure significantly counteracted the effects of load and wetness on ED and CI. There was a significant difference between the effects of 50 and 100 Mg ha(-1) of manure on ED, but not on CI. Manure application also reduced the subsoil compaction. Double passes of the tractor (P2) significantly increased compaction. There was a limitation for trafficability for no-manure treatment even at 0.6PL, whereas this limit was reached at 0.8PL for the 50 Mg ha(-1) treatment. Results from this study demonstrate that manure application at a rate of 50 Mg ha(-1) reduced soil compactibility and increased soil moisture trafficability range. Thus, increasing soil organic matter could bring about an appropriate solution for sustainable soil management in the region. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Management of coppice dynamics of indigenous savanna trees could assist in increasing the regrowth rates or number of coppice shoots produced. This would be useful in natural resource management programmes to promote sustainable resource management. This study examined the influence of cutting height, stem size and surface area on the number of coppice shoots produced for twelve savanna species from a communal land in the Bushbuckridge lowveld. Ail species exhibited a strong coppicing ability following cutting. The number of shoots per stump was most frequently related to cutting height. although this was not always the most significant predictor. There were clear differences between species with respect to the number of shoots per unit surface area. the highest being for Albizia harveyii and the least Piliostigma thonningii. The taller the potential height of a species, the fewer were the coppice shoots per stump surface area.

TI Linking impact assessment and sustainable development at the local
   level: The introduction of sustainability assessment systems
SO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Environmental impact assessment (EIA) and strategic environmental assessment (SEA), two instruments for environmental management that aim to prevent negative environmental impacts, are currently being examined for their usefulness in promoting sustainable development. Because of the importance of introducing sustainable development at the local level, this paper deals with impact assessment systems introduced by local authorities and links them to the sustainable development debate.
   First, the establishment of EIA and SEA systems at the local level is considered. The adaptation of existing impact assessment systems to their new role as sustainability assessment tool leads to the search for so called sustainability assessment systems. These systems aim to examine during the decision-making process whether policies, plans, programmes or other initiatives will lead society in a more sustainable direction. A framework for sustainability assessment studies is developed and proposals for the further improvement of EIA, SEA and sustainability assessment systems at the local level are discussed.

SO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB With the creation of the Regional Development Agencies (RDAs) on 1 April 1999 a new regional focus for planning and development now exists within England. Whilst primarily being concerned with economic development and regeneration, the RDAs also have a statutory responsibility to promote sustainable development. Policy guiding RDAs and their responsibilities has been reviewed and examined in relation to their ability to satisfy two central tenets of sustainable development: the integration of economic, social and environmental policy domains, and long range, holistic planning. If the RDAs are to satisfy these two goals they will require high quality information on the economic, social and environmental conditions projected for their regions in the short, medium and long term. A case study looking at the availability of this information in the North West of England is presented. Findings from this case study suggest a serious shortage of information sources which offer long term projections and integrate economic, social and environmental information in the context of the North West region.

SO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB This report aims to give a contribution to cultural sustainability by emphasizing the traditional knowledge of artisanal fishermen from Siribinha, a fishing community located in the county of Conde, in the northern region of Bahia State, north-eastern Brazil. Fieldwork was carried out from March 1996 to March 1998 and included open and semi-structured interviews, tours guided by the fishermen, direct observations and collection of fish specimens. The study focused especially on the folk taxonomy of fish and their spatiotemporal distribution and behaviour. The folk perception about the diminishing abundance of fishing resources has also been investigated. The consistence of traditional knowledge was observed through comparative cognitive tables. This research has shown that Siribinha fishermen's knowledge is a valuable resource, which is sufficient to be considered in the developmental processes and in studies of fish species management.

TI An accounting representation of sustainable agriculture practices: The
   case of a biogas agricultural unit in Sichuan
SO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB This article provides an accounting representation of a system of sustainable agricultural production, organized around a biogas unit in the Province of Sichuan, China. The aims of this exercise are numerous.
   First, it is important to highlight the existence of examples of sustainable practices, although (and because) they are fewer and fewer. A focus on the operationalization and analysis of the practical dimensions of sustainability is becoming an imperative in ecological economics.
   Secondly, this article works on the basis that a policy tool actually showing how sustainable production is organized could be more useful in helping policy-makers shift the current management of the economies towards a more sustainable one than 'aggregate green indicators' such as 'green GNP'.
   Finally, I show that green accounting systems need to evolve if they are to reflect new understandings of sustainability functioning. This accounting representation given in this paper provides an alternative view of green accounting. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

SP Dentsu Inc
AB An organization is flexible if it is capable of multiple responses to its environment. Because changing over from one response to another involves "set-up costs," flexibility can be regarded as detrimental to efficiency. But in a time of globalization and rapid change in business, companies must attend to agile response (flexibility) as much as to efficiency. Efficiency can be measured by several techniques, including Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). There is, however, no accepted, operational, and useful measure of organizational flexibility. This article characterizes the properties such a measure would have. Following some scene-setting discussion of the roles of efficiency and flexibility in theories of economics, evolution, and general systems, a general model of (relative) flexibility is proposed, building on Ashby's [1] definition of the variety that must be generated by a sustainable system. A special case of this model is applied to 10 years of financial data on 44 computer and computer-related companies. Results show that companies scoring high on a flexibility measure achieve more consistent efficiency over the time span studied. Discussion indicates how a flexibility model can complement DEA studies to round out the characterization of corporate performance. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc.

SO WORLD DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE Pacific; New Zealand; indigenous; sustainable development;
   self-determination; holistic development
AB In the 1990s, efforts to operationalize sustainable development have been led by Western ecological economists, utilizing Capital Theory. This conceptual work has largely ignored indigenous peoples' efforts to achieve self-determination and embark on development initiatives of their own. This paper argues that these grassroots initiatives have drawn on residual stocks of social/cultural capital for their impetus, and provide useful insights into problems of conceiving and operationalizing "sustainable development." Indigenous nations often espouse holistic frameworks broader than sustainable development models. They have had to address issues such as creating alternative governance structures, and how to incorporate holistic values into tribal development without jeopardizing business operations.

ID SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB The phenomenon of agricultural land degradation in the Philippine uplands has been regarded by scientists and policy-makers as a major environmental and rural development problem. Numerous conservation farming projects have been implemented in the past two decades to address this problem, apparently with little success. Most of these projects have espoused the currently fashionable principles of community-based sustainable development. This paper examines case histories of three completed upland conservation projects. The aim is to compare the rhetoric of project documents and evaluations with the reality of on-going land management practices as seen from the perspective of the land managers themselves.

AB The Malawi rural piped scheme program exemplified the participatory approach to rural drinking water supply. Today, between three and 26 years after completion, the smallest schemes, and the newest one, are performing well, but about half the schemes are performing poorly, and a third of these are functioning abysmally. Two implementation decisions would have improved performance, namely cash contributions from consumers, and the construction of smaller schemes. The participatory approach sets up community organizations capable of managing very small rural piped gravity schemes, but it does not address the need of larger schemes for support from a competent external agency.

TI Stratification and mapping of Taxus baccata L-bearing forests in Talle

SO CURRENT SCIENCE

DT Article
AB The yew plant (Taxus baccata L.) has acquired importance because it yields taxol, which is effective in the treatment of cancer the world over. There is great demand for Taxus from pharmaceutical companies and the species is being extracted heavily from its natural habitats throughout the world. This demand has necessitated the preparation of an inventory of Taxus-bearing forests for conservation and sustainable utilization. We have used remote sensing and Geographical Information system for identifying and mapping yew plants with reasonably good accuracy. IRS 1C LISS-III False Color Composite (FCC) data dated 2 January 1997 having 23.5 m ground resolution were applied for this purpose. These forests were visited on ground for a detailed vegetation analysis of the distribution of the yew plants. The raw data was corrected both radiometrically and geometrically and then enhanced using the standard image enhancement techniques such as linear contrast stretch. Various techniques of digital image classification such as hybrid clustering, masking and classification were tested to differentiate and delineate the yew-bearing forests in Talle Valley area falling in Lower Subansiri district of Arunachal Pradesh. Forests covered with various proportions of Taxus could be stratified and mapped with 85% accuracy. The preliminary results obtained in this study demonstrate that Taxus-bearing forests could be separated with a priori knowledge of vegetation types of the area.

AB A simple two-sex density dependent matrix model was applied to simulate the effects of harvesting deer (Odocoileus virginianus borealis Miller) with harvesting of only males, with harvesting of only females, and with harvesting of both males and females. When both males and females were harvested the relation between harvest and rate of harvest was a parabola. At the maximum sustainable harvest most of the deer harvested were fawns with several I-year-olds and a few 2- and 3-year-olds also harvested. If only males were harvested, yield increased asymptotically with increased harvest effort and there was no maximum sustainable yield. Deer abundance remained near the carrying capacity but nearly all of the deer were female. If only females were harvested, the harvest increased to a maximum and then decreased but the harvest was much smaller than when both males and females were harvested. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

DE ecosystem management; natural resources; state programs; enlibra
   doctrine
AB In the U.S., some state governments are beginning to adopt policies based on ecosystem management for conserving natural resources. Implicit or explicit in the policies usually is the concept of sustainable development that embodies achieving sustainable economies through the use of ecosystem management. State-level ecosystem management programs in the western U.S. often are in response to the Federal Ecosystem Management Initiative established by the White House in 1995 for federal land management agencies to apply to public lands. The intent of the policies in the western states, under the arising Enlibra doctrine of the Western Governors' Association (WGA), may or may not compliment the activities of federal agencies. Consequently, the idea for the new western doctrine, already formally embraced by the WGA, is viewed with skepticism by some aside from those involved in developing it. Midwestern and eastern states with emerging ecosystem management policies and programs are discussed and compared in this paper along with the programs arising in the western states under the emerging Enlibra doctrine.

AB A steady-state groundwater model that incorporates the vadose zone in an approximate fashion is developed to account for situations where recharge may be significantly affected by heterogeneity above the water table. The model is intended for basin-scale applications where the exact representation of the unsaturated zone is no longer feasible. The pseudo-unsaturated model is compared to a variably saturated model making use of an idealized cross-section approximating the complex Oro Moraine aquifer system. Differences in predicted flow regimes between the two models arise from the coarser mesh used in the pseudo-unsaturated simulations, but are minimal below the water table. The pseudo-unsaturated model yields an accurate overall system water mass balance although a loss in spatial resolution of predicted fluxes may occur. Such accuracy losses are offset by drastically lower computer memory requirements. The flow simulations further show that near-surface heterogeneity has a profound impact on the sustainable capacity of a groundwater system and the location of sensitive recharge areas. The pseudo-unsaturated model is then coupled to a high-conductivity layer atop the model domain to simulate rainfall runoff. An important advantage of this model formulation is that precipitation and evapotranspiration measurements can be directly used as model input, while groundwater infiltration is part of the flow solution. Runoff and baseflow contributions to long-term streamflow generation are also calculated and can be compared to data from gauging stations during model calibration. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Attempting to manage the environment as a whole, even from just a scientific standpoint, is not easy. The sheer size and scale can be daunting. It is difficult even to encompass the many facets involved. This short paper therefore attempts to tackle the problem by describing a framework approach which encompasses how one might assess the actual state of the environment at any one time; characterise the ever-changing pressures placed upon it; the manner by which the resultant problems need to be addressed; and thus what sort of responses are required. No system or framework is ever likely to be fully adequate, but some form of framework is essential in order to deliver a more sustainable approach to environmental management than has so far been achieved.

AB One key aspect of global change is a decrease in ecological integrity as more and more landscapes are developed, leaving a mosaic of intact refuges and degraded patches that may not be sufficient for conserving biodiversity. While increases in human population and shifts in the distribution of people affect Land use, the temporary movement of people can have major implications for conservation and biodiversity. Three examples are presented where recreation/tourism can enhance the conservation of land on a landscape scale, leading to habitat protection and biodiversity preservation: (1) Shorebirds often require a matrix of different habitat types during migratory stopovers, and ecotourism can serve as a catalyst for landscape scale protection of habitat. (2) Riparian habitats can serve as corridors to link diverse habitat patches, as well as serving as biodiversity hotspots. (3) Remediation and rehabilitation of contaminated lands, such as those of the US Department of Energy, aimed at developing recreational activities on the uncontaminated portions, can be the most economical form of re-development with no increase in human or ecological risk. Since large areas on many DOE sites have been undisturbed since the Second World War, when they were acquired, they contain unique or valuable ecosystems that serve an important role within their regional landscapes. In all three cases the judicious development of recreational/tourist interests can encourage both the conservation of habitats and the wise management of habitats on a landscape scale. While some species or habitats are too fragile for sustained tourism, many can be managed so that species, ecosystems and ecotourists flourish. By contributing to the economic base of regions, ecotourists/recreationists can influence the protection of land and biodiversity on a landscape scale, contributing to ecosystem management. The human dimensions of land preservation and biodiversity protection are key to long-term sustainability, and ecotourists/recreationists can be one management option. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB The significance of the introduction of the critical loads concept in the closing decades of the 20th century is considered critically, both in the context of its potential in planning pollution abatement strategies over a range of regional spatial and temporal scales and in terms of its more general impact upon atmospheric pollution effects research. Based upon perceived strengths and shortcomings of the concept and of the ways in which it has thus far been applied, a brief assessment is made also of its possible role in the opening decade of the new millennium. It is concluded that the validity of some of the fundamental underpinning concepts and of the data being used for their application could, and should, be questioned. Nevertheless, environmental pollution management and abatement policy planning will continue to require application of the critical loads concept or something very similar, both in existing and novel areas of application, for the sustainable management of soil and water resources in the long term.

ID MULTIPLE
AB Model-based Decision Support Systems (DSSs) often use multi-criteria optimization for selecting Pareto-optimal solutions. Such a selection is based on the interactive specification of user preferences. This can be done by a specification of aspiration and reservation levels for criteria. Diverse Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) can be used for specification of these levels, as well as for the interpretation of results. In the approach presented in this paper, the specified aspiration and reservation levels are used for the generation of component achievement functions for corresponding criteria, which reflect the degree of satisfaction with given values of criteria. This paper outlines the methodological background and modular structure of a tool ISAAP (which is included in MCMA) for multi-criteria analysis of decision problems that can be represented as Linear Programming (LP) or Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) problems. The MCMA has been used at IIASA for the analysis of decision problems in water quality management and land use for sustainable development planning. These experiences have shown that MCMA tool is applicable also to large LP and MIP problems. Other implementations of the same methodology have also been applied to analysis of non-linear problems in several engineering applications. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Aerobic organisms continually face exposure to reactive oxygen species (ROS) and many have evolved sophisticated antioxidant systems to effectively remove them. Any increase in ROS production or weakening in this defense system may ultimately lead to oxidative stress and cellular damage. We investigated whether long-term cold exposure, which is known to lead to an elevation in metabolic rate, increased the activities of the ROS-scavenging enzymes, catalase (CAT), selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and total superoxide dismutase (Total-SOD) in liver, cardiac muscle, kidney, skeletal muscle (vastus lateralis), and duodenum of shea-tailed field voles (Microtus agrestis), born and maintained at either 8 +/- 3 degrees C or 22 +/- 3 degrees C. CAT, GPx, and Total-SOD activities were determined at age 61 +/- 1.9 days. An increase in CAT activity in voles maintained at 8 +/- 3 degrees C was observed in skeletal muscle (71%) and kidney (20%), with both CAT and GPx activities significantly elevated (by 40 and 43%, respectively) in cardiac muscle, when compared to voles at 22 +/- 3 degrees C. Total-SOD activity and protein content did not differ significantly between groups in any tissue. We suggest that the compensatory increases in CAT (skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, kidney) and GPx (cardiac muscle), but not Total-SOD activities, resulting from long-term. cold exposure may reflect the elevated metabolic rate, and possibly also increased ROS production, at this time.

AB NASAs Earth science programme is developing an improved understanding of terrestrial productivity and its relationship to global environmental change. Environmental change includes changes that are anthropogenic, caused for example by increasing population and resource use, as well as those that are natural, caused by interannual or decadal variability in climate and intrinsic vegetation dynamics.
   In response to current science and policy concerns, the Earth science programme has carbon and the major biogeochemical cycles as a primary focus but is broad enough to include related topics such as land-atmosphere interactions associated with the hydrological cycle and the chemical composition of the atmosphere. The research programme includes the study of ecosystems both as respondents to change and as mediators of feedback to the atmosphere.
   Underlying all the research elements are important questions of natural resources and sustainable land management. The land cover and land use change element of the programme is aimed specifically at studying the causes and effects of land transformation and changes in land use practices.
   The NASA Earth science programme has a primary focus on using satellite remote sensing systems but also recognizes the need for an integrated approach to achieving its science goals by combining satellite and in situ process measurements and numerical modelling.
   This paper outlines the programme strategy for addressing its major focus. The approach adopted provides a balance between long-term satellite measurements of the Earth's surface at moderate and high spatial resolutions that are needed to quantify change, and the new experimental satellite missions that are aimed at addressing specific process research questions and testing new sensing technology. In addition to satellite measurements, ground-based in situ measurements are needed to validate the satellite data products, to describe and quantify processes, and to parameterize and validate process models. Numerical models need to be enhanced to provide both the study of processes and a predictive capability for the study of global change.

AB Environmental protection in German steel industry covers not only application of production integrated but also of so-called end-of-pipe technologies, which in the past have led to a decisive reduction of environmental damage. One example for successful application of combined production integrated and end-of-pipe technologies is the BOF process. Key targets of environmental control in iron- and steelmaking are the reduction of both the energy consumption and reducing agents, of process water, wastes to be disposed and, in connection with all this, an increase in the recycling rate and a steady and sustainable reduction in dust emissions.
   Environmental protection has been given a new direction, now that the main aims of clean air and water protection, recycling and noise control have been achieved. Organisation and economics are playing an increasing role, complementing the environmental protection practised so far, where plant technology is concerned, or showing a completely new development. Notable examples are life cycle inventories, environmental management, the extension of administrative instruments in the fields of recycling and waste disposal, transmission of emission data to the authorities, CO2-monitoring and fiscal regulations.

AB European Union environmental legislation is becoming increasingly complex and all-embracing. Galls for a sustainable use of natural resources by increased recycling, even expressed in EU waste legislation, are thwarted by other pieces of the same legislation. Waste legislation must therefore be adjusted to allow industry to increase recycling without unnecessary restrictions.
   Many residual products are classified as wastes even though they can be 100 % recycled. This causes significant problems for the recycling industry and has the effect of reducing the amount of material recycled. A clear definition of waste is therefore needed so that fully recyclable materials such as iron and steel scrap are not classified as waste.
   Legislators must avoid introducing environmental legislation so strict that efforts to meet the requirements lead to an increased load on the environment. The heavy metal provisions of the proposed Directive on End of Life Vehicles illustrate this risk.
   The Directive on Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control can be a useful tool for environmental improvement, if local permitting authorities adhere to the lPPC Directive's provisions, avoiding the temptation to take reference values in Best Available Techniques Reference Documents as limit values without regard to local conditions and the likely costs and benefits.
   The European steel industry can meet the climate change challenge if legislators allow the industry maximum flexibility in the choice of tools to achieve the desired improvement of energy efficiency. An energy tax is quite inappropriate because it would only reduce the funds available for investment for improved energy efficiency.

AB Mobility has become an important factor in life for all of us. The automobile has changed our lives so dramatically during the last hundred years that there is no comparison in history. Modern society makes strong demands on means of transport when choosing - both quantitatively and qualitatively, in order to achieve mobility.
   Ecological growth is neither possible nor sustainable without traffic increase. Mobility is the main factor deciding on the quality of economical location. The automotive industry as an investor in Germany, profits from the high demands made by the car customer. Critical customers here want to buy products of a quality well above average. Another advantage of this location is the quality and training of staff in production, sales, development and research, the know-how which has secured the good reputation of the products.
   However, the close proximity of marketplace and production has its limits when, in spite of all the advantages of the location, traffic becomes too cost intensive and inflexible for its users. This is why mobility technology must be developed fast during the next 15 years. One main perspective for the car of the future is network electronics and the driver assistance systems thereby made possible.

AB Forests are a global resource and important issues dealing with their use and maintenance cannot be effectively dealt with in an insular fashion. Global participation is mandatory, if these resources are to be sustained and equitably utilized. The seriousness and urgency of most of the forestry and environmental problems are linked to the inability or means of developing countries to provide appropriate scientific and technical knowledge, effective policy, regulations and planning frameworks to deal with the problems, To fully understand and appreciate the challenges to forest science, it is useful to establish an appropriate background against which they should be viewed, and suggest how to improve our capability to deliver knowledge for a sustainable future. There are three keys to making this a reality: information, innovation, and implementation - all derived from human resources. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Although "valuing diversity" has become a watchword, field research on the impact of a culturally diverse workforce on organizational performance has not been forthcoming. Invoking a resource-based framework, in this study I examined the relationships among cultural (racial) diversity, business strategy, and firm performance in the banking industry. Racial diversity interacted with business strategy in determining firm performance measured in three different ways, as productivity, return on equity, and market performance. The results demonstrate that cultural diversity does in fact add value and, within the proper context, contributes to firm competitive advantage.

ID SOIL CONSERVATION; DEGRADATION
AB Degradation of land continues to pose a threat to future food production potential in many developing economies. Various approaches, mainly based on command-and-control policies, have been tried (with limited success) in the past to encourage adoption of erosion-control practices by farm households. High transactions costs and negative distributional impacts on the welfare of the poor limit the usefulness of standards and taxes for soil and water conservation. One innovative approach is the use of interlinked contracts which create positive incentives for land conservation. This study analyses the social efficiency of such policies for erosion-control in the Ethiopian highlands using a non-separable farm household model. Incentive contracts linked with conservation seem to be promising approaches for sustainable resource use in poor rural economies. This may suggest that conservation programs should give greater consideration to better fine-tuning and mix of policies that help achieve both economic and environmental objectives.

   impacts and research agenda
SO AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
DE sub-Saharan Africa; sorghum and millet; impact; aggregate yields;
   inorganic fertilizers
AB In spite of substantial introduction of new sorghum and millet cultivars in semiarid Sub-Saharan Africa, there has been minimum aggregate impact on yields (FAO and ICRISAT, 1996: The World Sorghum Economies: Facts, Trends and Outlook. FAO, Rome, Italy and ICRISAT, Andhra Pradesh, India) in contrast with other crops, such as cotton and maize. Only where inorganic fertilizers and improved water retention or irrigation were combined with new cultivars were there large yield increases. Given the low soil fertility and irregular rainfall in semiarid regions, both increased water availability and higher levels of principal nutrients apparently will be necessary for substantial yield increase. The cultivar-alone strategy is unlikely to have a significant sustainable yield effect and therefore reduce poverty in semiarid Sub-Saharan Africa. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

DT Article
DE life-cycle design; post mass production paradigm; life-cycle simulation;
   planning of product life cycle; modular structure
AB Environmental issues require a new manufacturing paradigm because the current mass production and mass consumption paradigm inevitably cause them. We have already proposed a new manufacturing paradigm called the "Post Mass Production Paradigm (PMPP)" that advocates sustainable production by decoupling economic growth from material and energy consumption. To realize PMPP, appropriate planning of a product life cycle (design of life cycle) is indispensable in addition to the traditional environmental conscious design methodologies. For supporting the design of a life cycle, this paper proposes a life-cycle simulation system that consists: of a life-cycle simulator, an optimizer, a model editor, and knowledge bases, The simulation system evaluates product life cycles from an integrated view of environmental consciousness and economic profitability and optimizes the lift: cycles. A case study with the simulation system illustrates that the environmental impacts can be reduced drastically without decreasing corporate profits by appropriately combining maintenance, reuse and recycling, and by tailing into consideration that optimized modular structures differ according to life-cycle options.

AB Bracken is often perceived as a widespread and increasing land management problem. The pollen record of a wide range of sites in Great Britain suggests that the current abundance of bracken is less than or, at worst, equivalent to maximum historical levels. Recently gathered data also suggest that bracken cover is declining. Results of risk assessments of land use change, and experimental and modelling investigations into the effects of climate change are synthesized. This synthesis suggests that there is the potential for increased bracken dominance in northern Britain, spread into new areas at high altitudes, and possible spread into areas with reduced grazing. However, this must be set against any changes in the extent of other vegetation types at the expense of bracken. There is now a long history of bracken control, both in Great Britain and globally. Conventional methods of control (cutting, asulam application) are well understood, but many control attempts do not result in long-term success, as control is often not followed by aftercare. Bracken control is just one part of the process to ensure a sustainable use of resources and to maintain biodiversity. A coherent strategy for bracken control is put forward, a necessary part of which includes the restoration of vegetation and subsequent land management which takes into account an understanding of bracken ecology.

AB This paper provides evidence on local environmental mobilizations against tourism activities in Greece, Spain, and Portugal from the early 70s to the mid 90s. Its ultimate aim is to introduce to the sociology of tourism and environment a social movements approach. The paper focuses on active host community environmental groups and the groups they challenge. II. examines these groups' approaches and actions and the impact on tourism, local ecosystems, and sustainable development. The paper further highlights the determining factors of such conflicts and their deeper implications concerning socio-environmental aspects of Southern European societies.

DT Article
AB Many governments have a long-run target of lowering budget deficits in the future through current deficit spending, relying on economic growth to deliver their policy objective. This paper shows that this is unattainable under bond finance, since there exists no stable equilibrium. However, it is shown that a sustainable growth equilibrium is possible, but only if the deficit is treasury bill financed.

AB Zambia is a country with an extensive mining industry with the majority of mines located in the Copperbelt province. Through this region of the country, the Kafue River drains and receives effluent water from mining activities as well as from other industrial point sources. In addition, production of agricultural products and pest control requires use of different pesticides in the area. Information on industrial and agricultural pollution has not been clearly identified in Zambia, and little attention has been paid to pollution control and possible impact of metals, pesticides, and other persistent compounds in the environment. The objective of this study was to introduce and to evaluate a few methodologies based on in situ bioassays for environmental assessment to promote sustainable and environmentally sound water resource management of the Kafue River. The results show that caged threespot tilapia exposed downstream of industrial points sources rapidly bioaccumulate several trace elements, ic., Cd, Co, Cu, Cr, Ni. These elements also occurred in much higher concentrations in water samples downstream of the industrial area compared with a locality upstream. Furthermore, the use of a semipermeable membrane device (SPMD) for passive absorption of lipophilic pollutants in the water showed relatively high concentration of several pesticides, i.e., DDT with major metabolites, PCB, and dieldrin. The present study shows that only 2 weeks of in situ studies in waters contaminated by pollutants affects in situ exposed fish and that the correlation between water and tissue concentrations was relatively good. Both trace elements and persistent organic pollutants occurred in such high concentrations that they must be considered from ecotoxicological aspects and may affect aquatic animal health.

SO ARID SOIL RESEARCH AND REHABILITATION

DE chemical nitrogen fractionation; particle size fractions; soil
   regeneration
AB Understanding of the mechanisms involved in the restoration of degraded soils is necessary in order to assess the sustainability of a cropping system. For this purpose, an 8-year experiment was set up to test the efficiency of four cropping systems involving applications of fertilizer and/or manure and incorporation of crop residues and/or fallows on the regeneration of a Haplic Acrisol degraded by about 90 years of traditional cropping (groundnut-millet rotation without any input). The supply of nitrogen by the soil and particle size and chemical distribution were measured and used to characterize the soil organic matter (SOM) after 2 and 8 years of treatments, and then related to nutrients uptake. Two of the four cropping systems tested that were expected to regenerate soil fertility (QI and Q2: C-year rotations including a plowed-in fallow, incorporation of crop residues, and mineral fertilization) both had a depressive effect on SOM content, although the losses of total C and N observed during the experiment (e.g., -23% N and - 20% N for Q1 and Q2, respectively) were less than that for the central (traditional cropping B, -33% N). Only the multiyear fallow did nor result in further degradation of SOM, without, however, enriching the soil. On the other hand, an annual application of 10 Mg dry matter of manure ha(-1), combined with fertilizer, markedly increased the SOM (total N increased by factor 2 after only 2 years), an effect that seemed, however, stabilized at the end of the 8 years. Only a strong (10 Mg dry matter ha(-1)) and annual supply of manure, associated with mineral fertilization, had a positive effect on SOM, but its durability is not established.

TI The impact of long-term irrigation on changes of ground water level and
   soil salinity in northern Tunisia
SO ARID SOIL RESEARCH AND REHABILITATION
LA English
DT Article
DE irrigated; drainage; salt balance
AB The irrigated area of Kalaat Landelous in northern Tunisia is an example of the successful reclamation of 3000 ha of soils affected by shallow ground water levels and salinization. Examination of soil conditions at three key periods during reclamation reveals the reasons for this success. Aspects of irrigation management define these periods, during which measurements were taken of the depth and salinity of ground water over 43 years. An overall salt balance for the irrigated areas was made in order to estimate the risk of salinization. The results reveal a lowering of the ground water level (average depth was I m and will be 1.6 m), desalinization of the soils (average electrolytic conductivity of the soil was 0.8 S m(-1) and will be 0.55 S m(-1)), and dilution of the salt content of the ground water (average electrolytic conductivity of ground water was 3 S m(-1) and will be 1.4 S m(-1)). A reduction in the variability of saline conditions was also observed. The salt balance shows a large amount of salt exported from the area, between 22,000 and 66,000 Mg, and only small areas of new salinization have appeared as a result of irrigation. Ultimately, the sustainability of the project depends upon the performance of the drainage network and on the abundance of the rainfall. If drainage is efficient, soil salinity will be maintained below wheat, corn, tomato, pepper, and alfalfa tolerance limits.

ID ZZ CETI STARS; PG-1159 STARS; MASS-DISTRIBUTION; ASTEROSEISMOLOGY;
   PULSATIONS; CONSTRAINTS
AB One of the least understood aspects of white dwarf evolution is the process by which they are formed. The initial stages of white dwarf evolution are characterized by high luminosity, high effective temperature, and high surface gravity, making it difficult to constrain their properties through traditional spectroscopic observations. We are aided, however, by the fact that many H- and He-deficient pre-white dwarfs (PWDs) are multiperiodic g-mode pulsators. These stars fall into two classes: the variable planetary nebula nuclei (PNNV) and the "naked" GW Vir stars. Pulsations in PWDs provide a unique opportunity to probe their interiors, which are otherwise inaccesible to direct observation. Until now, however, the nature of the pulsation mechanism, the precise boundaries of the instability strip, and the mass distribution of the PWDs were complete mysteries. These problems must be addressed before we can apply knowledge of pulsating PWDs to improve understanding of white dwarf formation. This paper lays the groundwork for future theoretical investigations of these stars. In recent years, Whole Earth Telescope observations led to determination of mass and luminosity for the majority of the GW Vir pulsators. With these observations, we identify the common properties and trends PWDs exhibit as a class. We find that pulsators of low mass have higher luminosity, suggesting the range of instability is highly mass dependent. The observed trend of decreasing periods with decreasing luminosity matches a decrease in the maximum (standing-wave) g-mode period across the instability strip. We show that the red edge can be caused by the lengthening of the driving timescale beyond the maximum sustainable period. This result is general for ionization-based driving mechanisms, and it explains the mass dependence of the red edge. The observed form of the mass dependence provides a vital starting point for future theoretical investigations of the driving mechanism. We also show that the blue edge probably remains undetected because of selection effects arising from rapid evolution.

TI Reassessment of nuclear power? The memorandum by 650 scientists
SO ATW-INTERNATIONALE ZEITSCHRIFT FUR KERNENERGIE
LA German
DT Article
AB In the autumn of 1999, 570 scientists (650 by now) addressed politicians in a "Memorandum by German Scientists about the Planned Opt-out of Nuclear Power," demanding a "serious reassessment" of nuclear power. The Memoramdum was delivered to the Federal Chancellery on September 29. 1999 and published subsequently. Ten aspects are explained as positive factors advocating a strong nuclear contribution to a ";sustainable energy supply in the future." These include the following items:
   Germany is unable, in the single European market, to prevent imports of electricity from nuclear power plants to make up for the production from decommissioned domestic plants. Incidentally. this also applies to imports from countries in Eastern Europe tinder the provisions of the European Energy Charter and the WTO rules.
   If Germany were to give up the use of nuclear power, it would lose its influence over further improvements in safety worldwide of nuclear installations.
   As far as safety is concerned, German nuclear power plants hold, top positions worldwide. Their risk nowadays is minimal, if at all existent.
   Effective protection of the climate at economically tolerable terms is unattainable without nuclear power.
   Potential alternatives to nuclear power are either insufficient or fraught with economic drawbacks.
   Even in ecological terms, nuclear power is better than potential alternative ways of electricity generation.
   Consequently, this is the appeal by 650 scientists to politicians: Muster lip enough cow age to reassess the pros and cons in order to prevent an MCA in German energy policy: a maximum credible asininity.

AB Objective: To assess the sustainability and effectiveness of a community-directed program for primary and secondary prevention of obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease in an Aboriginal community in north-west Western Australia.
   Method: Evaluation of health outcomes (body mass index, glucose tolerance, and plasma insulin and triglyceride concentrations) in a cohort of high-risk individuals (n=49, followed over two years) and cross-sectional community samples (n-200 at baseline, 185 at two-year and 132 at four-year follow-ups), process (interventions and their implementation) and impact (diet and exercise behaviour).
   Results: For the high-risk cohort, involvement in diet and/or exercise strategies was associated with protection from increases in plasma glucose and triglycerides seen in a comparison group; however, sustained weight loss was not achieved. At the community level, significant reductions were observed in fasting insulin concentration but no change in prevalence of diabetes, overweight or obesity. Weight gain remained a problem among younger people. Sustainable improvements were observed for dietary intake and level of physical activity. These changes were related to supportive policies implemented by the community council and store management.
   Conclusions: Community control and ownership enabled embedding and sustainability of program, in association with social environmental policy changes and long-term improvements in important risk factors for chronic disease.
   Implications: Developmental initiatives facilitating planning, implementation and ownership of interventions by community members and organisations can be a feasible and effective way to achieve sustainable improvements in health behaviours and selected health outcomes among Aboriginal people.

ID MELANOTHERON
AB Muni is a closed lagoon that opens to the sea when the water level is high, especially during the rainy season. During the dry period, the water level is very low and the salinity of the lagoon water increases sometimes exceeding that of seawater. Only three finfish species and 8 shellfish species (live animals and empty shells) were found in the lagoon and surrounding wetlands during the study which was conducted in March-June 1994. The blackchin tilapia Sarotherodon melanotheron (Cichlidae) is the dominant species. The castnet is the most important fishing gear used in the lagoon followed by various finfish and shellfish traps. The fishing effort in the lagoon is high and, like catch rates, it was found to be inversely related to the volume of water in the lagoon and the fishing situation in the sea. The estimated exploitation level (E = 0.65) indicates that S. melanotheron in the Muni lagoon could be considered as over-exploited. From the gonadosomatic index, S. melanotheron appears to spawn continuously in the Muni lagoon between the months of March and June. The von Bertalanffy growth parameters were estimated for S. melanotheron as L-infinity = 12.5 cm standard length (SL), K = 0.70 yr(-1) and t(0) = 0.01 yr. The longevity of the fish is estimated as ca. 4.2 yr. Taboos and cultural practices contribute to the management and conservation of fisheries in the lagoon. However, additional formal management is required to ensure sustainability of the fisheries in the lagoon. In addition, there is a need to manage the lagoons physical and chemical environment including planting of mangroves around the lagoon in order to restore its mangrove cover. The poverty problem in the fishing community needs to be addressed to divert labour from the lagoon.

AB The proposed innovative approach identifies a new application for biomass. Bioenergy is used to drive a desalination unit which produces water for irrigating energy crops. Biomass is cultivated on artificial soil made by a mixture of local soil and organic compost from MSW (Municipal Solid Wastes). This agro-energy farm scheme aims at rescuing arid lands near to the sea.
   The study defines a techno-economic compromise among energy crops, biomass generator, desalination unit and irrigation system, considering an arid area (10 ha) of Tenerife as reference case study. A small experimental activity (100 m(2)) has also been performed on site. A Sweet Sorghum cultivation, a bioenergy generator, a reverse osmosis plant and drip irrigation system have been chosen. The main result of the study is that the possibility of retaining some 14-20% surplus (in terms of biomass or energy or water) exists. The system is energetically feasible: rescued land can be doubled in approximately 4 yr. This approach is applicable to many Mediterranean coastal areas, as well as other similar situations elsewhere. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

DE ecosystem; sustainability; construction; emergency development;

AB The Gaza Strip region is a fragile ecosystem suffering from increasing environmental assaults due to the escalating population growth and the very limited natural resources available to support their development demands. Currently, there are a number of large scale construction projects being implemented in the process of newly developing Palestine. The major challenge in the development context is to maintain ecological balance which is often sacrificed when rapid economical growth is pursued putting enormous pressure on the natural endowments. This implies a search for innovative and new building materials and construction technology in order to minimize the pressure on the environment. The aim of this paper is to study the impact of rapid construction development on the environment in Gaza Strip. It is strongly recommended that Palestine should follow a program to promote sustainable development through the building of better institutions, and providing appropriate information and investment. It is necessary to assess the impacts of the proposed projects in Gaza Strip and to take certain measures to mitigate the negative impacts. There is a need for raising environmental public awareness and training. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents theoretical and applied state-of-the-art information in the field of alkali-aggregate reactivity (AAR) in concrete. The aspects discussed include basic concepts of the reaction and expansion mechanisms, conditions conducive to the development and the sustainability of AAR in concrete, field and laboratory investigation programs for evaluating the potential alkali-reactivity of concrete aggregates, selection of preventive measures against AAR, and the management of structures affected by AAR. The management section includes the diagnosis of AAR in existing concrete structures, evaluation of the potential for future distress due to AAR, and mitigation and repair approaches used on such structures. This is an introductory paper and sets the stage for a special review of the current AAR situation in the various regions of Canada that is presented in seven papers as part of this issue.

AB The cities of the developing world face major problems in managing growth and their urban infrastructure. The experiences of cities in the developed world have usually proved inappropriate in developing countries and consequently new and innovative solutions are continually being explored for these cities, Geographic information systems and the underlying spatial data infrastructures appear to offer significant potential to assist in managing human settlements in developing countries. In examining the status of spatial data infrastructures in developing countries, the first part of the paper compares cities in developing countries to those in the developed world. It then highlights issues facing developing countries in establishing spatial data infrastructures to support efficient urban land management. The paper describes the Bangkok Land Information System as an example of a city attempting to use spatial information technologies to manage the urban environment. This case study, together with the experience of the authors, are used to describe generic issues involved in the development of spatial data infrastructures for cities in similar socio-economic conditions. The paper provides a technical and institutional framework for the development of spatial data infrastructures for cities in developing countries. The paper concludes by suggesting that simple, low cost, project oriented, easily maintained and user-friendly spatial information technologies have the best chance of success.

TI Urban regeneration and sustainable development in Britain - The example
   of the Liverpool Ropewalks Partnership
SO CITIES
LA English
DT Article
DE liverpool; sustainable development; urban regeneration
AB Despite the emergence of urban regeneration and sustainable development as parallel strands of British urban policy, there has been little co-ordination between them and an imbalance in action with greater emphasis given to achieving urban regeneration, especially economic regeneration, than to sustainability, It can be argued that all urban regeneration contributes to sustainable development through the recycling of derelict land and buildings, reducing demand for peripheral development and facilitating the development of more compact cities. But below this strategic level British urban policy has yet to fully address the requirement for more sustainable development. This paper addresses this question through an examination of policy in Liverpool and a case study of Duke Street/Bold Street (the Rope Walks Partnership): a mixed use area adjoining the city centre, It is important to place local action within the context of national policies and so the paper begins with some discussion of the extent to which the principles of sustainable development are included within national urban regeneration policies before going on to examine policy at the metropolitan scale in Liverpool and then at the more detailed level of the Rope Walks area, The conclusions suggest that it is economic regeneration and more precisely property redevelopment, that is the main driving force regenerating the area and that there is some way to go before the city or the case study area achieve an environmentally sustainable regeneration process.

TI The first step for the environmental management of Australian beaches:
   Establishing an effective policy framework
SO COASTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article

ID COASTAL MANAGEMENT
AB Beach management and coastal management ave interwoven and scale-dependent activities in Australia. Present coastal policies are broad and designed for large, national and statewide scales. They specify ecologically sustainable development as the overarching goal for coastal management and provide the context for bench management. On smaller scales, an approach focusing on the reduction of geomorphic hazards as the basis of beach management was established by the Coastline Hazard Policy, with nonhazard aspects of beach management such as ecological, economic, and social concerns assuming secondary importance. Although beach management can occur effectively under these coastal management arrangements better guidance is required to make this process as effective and efficient as possible. This guidance-the policy framework-could be better developed for bench management and better integrated with existing coastal management arrangements. While this policy development is not strictly necessary to achieve positive outcomes from bench management, it is necessary to effectively guide implementation of the existing broad coastal policies. Effective goals for bench management are yet to be thought out and clearly articulated in Australia. A good start would be to couple the present goals of ecologically sustainable development and hazards reduction into a coherent goal for bench management. A specific policy for beaches should be developed given the importance of beaches in Australia.

AB To contribute significantly to environmental policy of the next century, conservationists will need to reach a consensus on their fundamental values and goals and to persuade society to adopt them. Resolution of the debate over the continued role of naturalness as a guiding concept has important implications for how conservation is practiced and the future of the discipline. I examine five aspects of naturalness in the context of biological conservation: (1) its utility, (2) its assessment, (3) its relation to values and ethics, (4) alternative imperatives, and (5) implications of adopting it as a guiding concept. Naturalness can be viewed as a continuous gradient with completely natural and completely artificial extremes. Human actions are unnatural to the extent that they rely on technology to transform natural ecosystems. The ecological consequences of technological transformation often overwhelm the capacity of other biota to adapt and are a root cause of biodiversity loss. The naturalness of most ecosystems or ecosystem alterations can be assessed objectively despite imperfect knowledge if evolutionary limits and natural ranges of variability are carefully considered. Most conservationists value naturally evolved biotic elements such as genomes and communities over artificial elements. This judgment, which is not shared by society at large, is based on intrinsic and instrumental values, including respect for nature and recognition that many ecosystem amenities stem from natural processes. Given the wide accessibility of ecologically destructive technology, fundamental shifts in societal values and approaches to ecosystem alteration are needed to achieve conservation. Respect for nature must supplant the prevailing world view of human superiority. Although sometimes difficult to assess, naturalness is a more reasonable guide for conservation than are other ecosystem features such as diversity, productivity, or evolution, and naturalness is the foundation for several current conservation concepts such as ecological integrity and ecological restoration. Conservation biologists can help develop conservation practices and ethics that emphasize the importance of natural ecosystems. Key roles include refining distinctions between natural and anthropogenic conditions, devising ways to use ecosystems without losing biotic diversity, and facilitating shifts in societal values toward more respect for nature.

AB Telemedicine is a communications technology that can be expected to influence investment in equipment, the delivery and organisation of health services and outcomes of healthcare. Analysis of the economic impact of telemedicine has so far been limited and has focused on cost studies for individual applications. Telemedicine initiatives should be compared with conventional alternatives. A search of recent literature revealed 20 such studies that included, usually limited, economic analyses. It is important to note, however; that such assessments apply to localised situations and may not he generalisable. Overall, the potential impact of telemedicine on healthcare systems remains unclear.
   The challenges that lie ahead for telemedicine, and its economic assessment, include technological change, sustainability of applications, availability of outcomes and other data, and generalisability of evaluation results.

AB Fishery scientists and managers and the general public are becoming increasingly aware of, and concerned about, the direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts of habitat change on commercial and recreational fisheries, and the effects of these fisheries in an ecosystem context. This set of concerns is coupled with declines in some fish stocks due to mismanagement, such as overfishing, failure to account for bycatch, or gear damage to habitats, and/or changing environmental conditions. At the same time, there are examples of management decisions and habitat restoration efforts that have led to the recovery of depleted stocks and habitats. All of this is happening in the context of new concerns about marine biodiversity, marine reserves, and application of the Endangered Species Act to marine species (e.g., salmonids with extensive riverine, and ocean habitat needs).
   The Sustainable Fisheries Act (SFA), passed by Congress in September 1996, and signed by President Clinton 11 October 1996, is a wake-up call that mandates, as federal policy, that fishery management move toward better incorporation of information on fish habitats and use of ecosystem approaches in management decisions. Currently, fishery managers in the National Marine Fisheries Service and the eight regional councils are in the process of adapting to these new directions. Habitat-oriented and ecosystem-based approaches offer potential solutions to some of the management problems, but they are not panaceas. Ecosystem approaches carry institutional requirements that demand major changes in research and training and require support from the user communities and the public. Ecologically sustainable fisheries are undoubtedly much different fisheries from many of those now observed. Actions to implement the SFA portend significant progress toward more sustainable fisheries and healthier ecosystems. However, major gaps exist in understanding how to manage the transition from current fishery practices to ecologically sustainable ones, and significant increases in human and fiscal resources are necessary to overcome these gaps.

AB Despite the ecological and economic importance of fish, fisheries management has generally failed to achieve its principal goal of sustainability. Management is hindered because most exploited fish are long-lived species that utilize a variety of habitats and exhibit high interannual fluctuations in abundance. Effective management requires that we understand how natural and anthropogenic sources of variability in abiotic variables (termed environmental quality [EQ]) affect fish population dynamics. Quantifying the effects of anthropogenic changes in EQ on fish populations has remained elusive and controversial. I illustrate, with examples, six issues related to quantifying EQ effects on fish populations. These examples also serve as demonstrations of how modeling can be used to address these issues. The six issues are: (1) detectability-high interannual variation and interaction effects among climatic variables that affect population dynamics make isolating effects of individual stressors difficult; (2) complex habitat and nonintuitive responses-spatial heterogeneity in habitat can result in population responses that are disproportionate to the changes in EQ; (3) regional predictions-biological realism is often sacrificed unnecessarily when broad spatial scale predictions are needed; (4) community interactions-too little attention is paid to how community-level interactions can affect population-based analyses; (5) sublethal effects-sublethal effects are often ignored but can have large effects on population dynamics; and (6) cumulative effects-the combined effect of multiple stressors can be much different than expected from the sum of their individual effects. Examples include a variety of freshwater and marine species. Quantifying EQ effects on fish populations can be improved by considering these issues in analyses, and by taking a true multidisciplinary approach that combines individual-based modeling and life history theory.

AB This paper aims to offer an applicable evaluation framework for assessing sustainable development strategies at the regional level, with a particular view on the treatment of uncertain information. After a survey of various regional sustainable development studies, several methodological issues pertaining to regional sustainability are presented and discussed, which lay the foundation for the central approach in this paper, viz. the use of critical threshold values. Based on a multidimensional indicator system, a systematic multicriteria model is proposed by employing the recently developed and user-friendly flag model. This model is able to take into consideration various relevant classes of (non) compliance with critical threshold values. By means of this model an empirical case study is undertaken for the Songkhla/Hat Yai area in southern Thailand. Three policy scenario's (decentralization, sectoral and regional promotion and environmental protection) are systematically evaluated using a blend of the above-mentioned critical threshold value and the flag approach. It is concluded that in general the decentralization policy is slightly more preferable than the sectoral and regional development scenario and significantly more preferable than the environmental protection scenario for the region concerned. The analytical tools used (a qualitative systems approach, the use of critical threshold values and the flag model) appeared to yield a satisfactory contribution to sustainability assessment, even in case of qualitative information.

AB In the 1920s, Alfred Lotka suggested that evolution results both in an increasing total energy flow through the biosphere and in increasing energy efficiency of biological processes. Later authors attempted to generalize Lotka's conjectures and to transform them into general evolutionary laws. These laws are derived from the laws of thermodynamics, and it is frequently argued that they also apply to the development of economic systems. In the present paper, an alternative interpretation of the Lotka principles is suggested which starts from the self-organization of dissipative structures. Self-organization concepts from ecological and evolutionary economics are integrated. On this basis, energetic regularities in evolutionary processes are interpreted as emergent properties of competitive self-organization. Given the close relationship between energy dissipation in economic processes and various environmental problems, thermodynamic effects of economic evolution are of practical policy relevance. The evolutionary perspective taken here implies that policy measures toward sustainable development will primarily have to affect the kinds of innovative behavior triggered in competitive processes.

AB In recent years, the concept of 'sustainability indicators' has become prominent in agricultural science. The idea is that particular characteristics of resources are monitored and recorded, with the intention that this information serves as an aid for decision making by farmers and/or policy makers. A great many sustainability indicators have been proposed by agricultural scientists. However, there is no guidance currently available as to which of the possible sustainability indicators provide information of economic value. In this paper we present a conceptual framework for the economic valuation and prioritisation of sustainability indicators. The framework is based on Bayesian decision theory, particularly its use to calculate the value of information under conditions of uncertainty. We present an illustrative numerical example. Based on this example and the theoretical framework, we identify a number of important insights about the practical use of sustainability indicators. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Investigation of the Star River catchment in Germany shows very high annual matter losses (about 1050 kg total mineral salts per ha; excluding NaCl). Loss of base cations (e.g. Ca 263 kg ha(-1) year(-1)), which are essential elements, was an important focus of this research. Compared to the stock of base cations to those minerals added by fertilising, topsoils are being depleted continuously. If this loss is not stopped, a complete breakdown of vegetation growth is expected. Strong impacts on the water cycle and a land management that is spatially and temporally unadapted leads to insufficient energy dissipation in both physical (evapotranspiration, condensation) and biological cyclic processes (photosynthesis, respiration). The resultant increased thermal and chemical potentials cause changes by way of feedback loops on the water cycle and cause matter losses. Some suggestions are presented to manage land sustainably - minimising matter losses with the help of managed wetlands and using much more perennial vegetation biomass. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB The overall approach of the budget in regard to agriculture and rural development of containing subsidies and increasing investment, is right. But real rationalisation of subsidies requires not merely price revisions but substantial institutional reforms. Similarly, it would require massive doses of investment in Irrigation and R and D before a significant weather-proofing of Indian agriculture can be achieved and to expect that the proposals contained in the budget for 2000-2001 can put agriculture on a sustainable growth path of 4 per cent per annum is naive.

TI Fiscal policy rules in macroeconomic models: principles and practice
SO ECONOMIC MODELLING
LA English
DT Article
DE macroeconomic models; fiscal policy; closure rules; sustainability;
   model simulations
AB Fiscal closure rules that enforce the government's intertemporal budget constraint are important elements of macroeconomic models. This article presents a systematic study of the different rules employed on different models, considering both their theoretical properties and their comparative behaviour in model simulations. For tax-difference rules targeting debt/GDP or deficit/GDP ratios and tax-level rules which include the MSG2 'incremental interest payments' rule as a special case we show how both the steady-state implications and, to some extent, the short-run dynamics can be made comparable. Many of the theoretical equivalences are then observed in simulations of the MSG2 MULTIMOD and NIGEM models. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved. JEL classifications: C5; E6.

TI Rescaling irrigation in Latin America: The cultural images and political
   ecology of water resources
SO ECUMENE
LA English
DT Article
ID ANDES; BOLIVIA
AB A pair of scales - local canal-based (or village-based) and basin-scale (or valley-wide) - is featured in the irrigation of the mountain landscapes of Latin America. These scales arose historically through the interplay of cultural images with the political ecologies of agrarian transformation. In the Cochabamba region of Bolivia, long die irrigated breadbasket of the south-central Andes, the Inca state (c. 1495-1539) imposed canal-based irrigation using ct powerful concept of rotational sharing (suyu). Valley basins containing local irrigation were a part of the territorial web of Inca state geography known later as verticality. The Spanish empire in Andean South America (1539-1825) was predicated upon a valley-centric colonial geography. Colonial rescaling involved despoliation and usurpation of waterworks, legal actions, and struggles over environmental change. Influence of the two irrigation scales has persisted. Today canal-based irrigation is not a timeless relict of indigenous customs, pace many postcolonial projects. Rather its usefulness, and ia remarkable reinvention as ii. Cultural concept and environmental creation, are the products of major modifications. Dismantling of multi-scale linkages in irrigation has reduced indigenous or peasant cross-scale co-ordination. Local containment poses threats Co the environmental and socio-economic sustainability of canal-based irrigation.

TI Electric grid and heat planning scenarios with centralised and
   distributed sources of conventional, CHP and wind generation
SO ENERGY
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper defines two electric grids for the area of Jutland in Denmark, namely the existing grid versus a "nature protection grid", in which all 400 kV AC overhead lines are replaced by 150 kV lines. According to official Danish policies for laying underground cables, such a replacement makes it economically feasible on a long-term basis to replace all overhead lines with underground cables. The two grids are then tested against different energy demand and supply systems in a load-flow analysis. It is found that the "nature protection grid" is well suited for the implementation of sustainable energy systems exploiting both CHP and renewable energy sources such as wind power if certain strategies for the technical regulation of decentralised CHP units are used.

AB Herbicidal control of spotted knapweed, Centaurea maculosa Lamarck, is rarely cost-effective, and sustainable control may require an integrated approach. Cyphocleonus achates (Fahraeus) is a flightless root-feeding weevil of Eurasian origin that has been introduced into North America for biological control of spotted knapweed. We hypothesized that reducing the density of spotted knapweed using reduced rates of picloram would improve the establishment of C. achates. At two sites in western Montana, three adult weevil densities (none, three, and six weevils m(-2)) were released in the fall (1995 at site 1 and 1996 at site 2) in 2-m(2) plots encircled with enclosures to prevent weevil escape. Six picloram rates (0, 0.03, 0.06, 0.09, 0.12 or 0.15 kg ha(-1)) were applied the following spring before weevil emergence in a randomized complete-block design with four replications (18 treatments per replication). Spotted knapweed density and spotted knapweed and grass cover were sampled in July each year following treatment. Weevil numbers were counted annually in August. By 1998, picloram rates of >0.09 kg ha(-1) had reduced spotted knapweed density from approximate to 500 to approximate to 175 plants m(-2). Cover was reduced from approximate to 60 to 10% at these rates. There was no detectable impact of weevils on spotted knapweed. Weevil numbers in plots treated with picloram >0.09 kg ha(-1) were about half (0.5 weevils per plot) the numbers found in the other picloram treatments (1.25 weevils per plot). Weevil numbers in plots treated with 0.03, 0.06, and 0.09 kg ha(-1) were similar to the unsprayed control. Weevil numbers were highest when spotted knapweed cover was between 30 and 70%. Results show than reduced rates of picloram do not limit weevil establishment.

ID HYDROGEN ISOTOPE ANALYSIS
AB Due to the rapid expansion of the Sudanese capital city far away from its three Niles, it has become a necessity to estimate the sustainability of the groundwater resources in this arid area. The purpose of this study - based on the stable-isotopic composition of groundwater - is to identify the sources of recharge and their relative contribution. The results show that groundwater infiltrated from the Niles under the present prevailing arid climate, with greater contribution from the White Nile compared to the Blue Nile, occupies an extension of 12 km from the Niles within the two main aquifers. Paleogroundwater of meteoric origin, infiltrated in the cooler pluvial earlier Holocene, occupies the outer zones beyond the Niles' effect. A rational utilization policy is recommended to preserve the finite groundwater resources.

AB A method is proposed for the evaluation of potential impacts of arable farming systems on the environment. The first step is the calculation of evaluation modules that estimate the impact of each agricultural technique on each environmental component. These modules are aggregated either to rank or classify cropping systems by means of multicriteria methods or to generate an agro-ecological indicator (AEI). Nine agro-ecological indicators have been tested: nitrogen fertilisation, phosphorus fertilisation, pesticides, irrigation, crop succession, cropping pattern,crop covering, organic matter, and ecological structures; two others are in development: energy and soil management. Together, the AEIs provide a 'control panel' for the farm. These agro-ecological indicators are calculated mostly at the field level and then averaged over the whole farm. As input, few parameters used in the calculation of these indicators are region-specific (e.g., reference of sowing dates, leaching periods). Since 1994, the indicators are established with data from a network of 17 arable farms in the Rhine plain (France and Germany) to characterise the degree to which the objectives of sustainable agriculture have been reached by these farms.

AB This study is concerned with the role that communication can play in facilitating the utilization of ecological information by different sectors of society involved in environmental decision-making. The ecological information system is used as a conceptual framework. This system is a model for the analysis of interactions between three sectors involved in the management of natural resources: researchers in ecology, change agents, and rural producers. Two case studies of organizations carrying out scientific research aimed at finding and implementing sustainable strategies of resource management were carried out. The purpose was to examine how real situations function in terms of communication strategies and to analyze such situations in relation to the model proposed. The analysis revealed the importance of promoting the feedback of information from change agents and rural producers to the research sector and the incorporation of this information into the research process. It also emphasized the relevance of having "active utilizer constituencies" within the rural producers who make demands upon the entire system in order to satisfy information needs. The creation of linkage systems facilitating the connection between the generation and utilization of information was supported. In particular, the establishment of special teams within research institutions is proposed, which could promote the links between the sectors through the use of communication as an instrument of work.

TI Sustainable farming practices: Ghanaian farmers' perception of erosion

ID SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA; SOIL
AB Soil erosion in Africa has been in the limelight over the last two decades with researchers and policy-makers calling for sustainable farming practices. This is often based on the assumption that farmers have a poor perception and little knowledge about soil erosion and conservation measures and completely ignores the realities of the African environment and the socioeconomic constraints farmers are faced with. This paper investigates the way farmers in northern Ghana perceive soil erosion and their rationality when it comes to their choice of conservation measures, and the question is asked whether the existing farming practices can be considered sustainable. Based on this study it appears that farmers have a clear perception of the problem and adopt a wide range of conservation measures, depending on the availability of stones and grasses, possible side effects associated with using these measures, as well as the time spent on establishing and maintaining them. This study shows that when trying to find solutions to soil erosion problems, both the physical and socioeconomic realities of the environment have to be considered.

AB Ethiopia has been engaged in expanding immunization services against the six childhood diseases since 1980. According to plans set at the beginning of the program, the country should have achieved universal child immunization by now. However, the child immunization coverage has never reached the level that is desired to curtail disease transmission and to reduce the morbidity burden associated with the target diseases. This study used the potential of social science research methods in understanding social, cultural, political and economic factors that influence the efficiency and effectiveness of immunization programs in the Ethiopian context A better understanding of these factors is believed to improve the qualify and sustainability of immunization programs. This research focused on relevant issues at micro- and macro-levels. The study basically utilized qualitative research methods involving multiple data collection tools and information sources. Factors related to accepters, immunization service providers and organization of health services that influence the successful implementation and sustainability of the immunization program in the Ethiopian context ave identified and discussed Strengthening efforts to improve technical capacity of service providers, increasing social mobilization? activities, instituting quality assurance schemes and improving management of resources (human, finance and material) are among the major recommendations.

AB Faced with the dramatic loss of manufacturing employment in the late 1980s and early 1990s, two regions of Massachusetts became home to innovative industrial modernization programmes designed to enhance the performance of remaining enterprise and hopefully strengthen the state's manufacturing base. The Machine Action Project, a community and industry bared endeavour in Western Massachusetts, worked with hundreds of metalworking firms while in Eastern Massachusetts the University of Massachusetts Lowell restructured many of its existing academic and research activities to better meet the needs of firms and communities. These two programmes are analysed for the ways in which they established public-private partnerships to enhance their regional economies ar well as contributed to the ongoing discussion over the role of public institutions in sustainable regional development.

AB The private sector can create unique institutions that help to achieve industrial and economic goals. To demonstrate this growth model, the Houston Advanced Research Centre (HARC) was created as a private non-profit organization, part of a new town development north of Houston, Texas. Over its 17-year history, HARC has successfully linked university, industry and governmental research in this framework. During this time,four strategies have been tested: large or sensitive R&D projects, strong links with member universities, efforts to bring technology to the marketplace, and policy analysis and advice. Of these, the latter three are today's successes as HARC has become a more responsive, service-oriented organization. Also, sustainable development has emerged as a unifying theme, reflecting part of the organization's initial legacy from its founder, George P. Mitchell. The Woodlands has grown around HARC as a place to live for over 50,000 people, a growing job bare, and realization of the initial "research forest" concept with more than 100 firms and 4,500 employees.

AB Constitutional reforms are taking place in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. These offer the opportunity to bring about a more effective policy framework for a range of policy areas including land use planning. In Scotland, the introduction of the Scottish Parliament in 1999 could allow, the improvement of spatial planning policy and practice in a variety of ways, including bringing a more strategic approach at regional level, introducing a national plan and ensuring greater links with innovative community planning exercises. Such improvements could ensure a more sustainable environment as well as a more inclusive society and could offer lessons for similar practice in other contexts.

DT Article
ID LEARNING REGION; PROXIMITY; KNOWLEDGE
AB The first part of this article examines the concept of regional innovation systems against the background of modern theories of innovation and regional policies. It is argued that the role of localized learning is of strategic importance in the promotion of endogenous regional development. With reference to current research on regional policy, the author also argues that sustainable regional strength is built on a continuously upgraded knowledge base, rather than on general factor endowment. By stimulating localized learning, the regional innovation systems have an important role to play and offer possibilities of producing regional competitive advantage. The author then suggests how regional innovation systems can be organized in order to increase innovation at various levers. Finally, some sketches are provided of various innovation strategies operating at the regional level from which lessons of direct policy relevance may be learned and adapted to the Portuguese context.

TI Anticipatory long-term research for sustainable productivity
SO EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
AB Drawing on ideas advanced during the course of an international workshop, this paper reviews agricultural research priorities in the dry areas of the developing world, where economic and demographic pressures are driving a rapid intensification of production, even on very fragile lands. Current priorities for research and research funding reflect a strongly felt need, among governments and donor agencies, for rapid problem-solving to relieve poverty. In this context, traditional long-term agronomic research trials, with essentially strategic and basic objectives, are often seen as irrelevant. Yet the need to anticipate problems impending in environments where intensification is consuming the natural resource base and degrading the production potential is an urgent one. To accommodate this need to the perceptions of the different stakeholders, a new research paradigm, 'Anticipatory Long-Term Research for Sustainable Productivity', is proposed. It invokes a holistic approach, building a longer view and greater dynamism into traditional agronomy, enhancing ties to socio-economic and resource management disciplines, and reconciling the immediate demand for high-yielding technology with the strategic issues of sustainable production.

TI Time trends in crop yields in long-term trials
SO EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
AB Trends over time in annual crop yields potentially provide measures of the likely long-term sustainability of cropping systems. However, where large annual variability in the growth environment is responsible for most of the large year-to-year yield differences, appropriate analytical techniques must be developed to distinguish real long-term trends from the 'back-ground noise'. This paper presents models for the estimation of time trends in the yield data from crop rotation systems and discusses the results of applying these models to yield values from two types of long-term trial involving barley, each conducted at two sites in northern Syria.
   The models used were linear with respect to time (years) and allowed for seasonal effects by means of a quadratic relationship on total rainfall and a linear relationship on planting date. A more complex model might account for more of the variance, but restrictions were imposed by the limited number of degrees of freedom (number of years of data less one) and the choice of meaningful single-valued parameters of growth-season conditions. For many experimental treatments the model accounted for less of the total variance at the wetter site. This may be due to seasonal bufferring by soil moisture stored at depth from one year to the next, and future iterations of the analysis will try to allow for this. The appropriateness of the linear time function is also questioned, and alternative functions will be tested along with alternative structures for plot errors over time.

TI Long-term effects of tillage, phosphorus fertilization and crop rotation

SO EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE
LA English

ID STABILITY ANALYSIS; NIGER; YIELD; SOIL; SORGHUM; SYSTEMS
AB The millet (Pennisetum glaucum)-based cropping systems that dominate the Sudano-Sahelian Zone of West Africa cannot, as they are currently practised, meet the growing food needs of the region. They must therefore be intensified in a sustainable manner. The present study was initiated in 1986 and continued until 1996 to evaluate the effects of phosphorus (P) fertilization, tillage and rotation with sole cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) on an operational scale with two cropping systems, namely, sole miller and millet-cowpea intercropping. A randomized complete block design with four replications was used. The effects of P fertilization, ridging with animal traction and planting on ridges (AT), and rotation with sole cowpea increased the productivity of miller substantially in 10 of the 11 years. Based on the 11-year average, P fertilization alone improved grain yield by 52%, and AT with P fertilization improved grain yield by nearly 135%. Combining AT, P fertilization and the sole cowpea rotation resulted in a 200% increase in grain yield compared with the traditional system of production. Miller productivity did not show a significant decline when intercropped with cowpea. Stability and relative stability analysis showed that the traditional system was more stable than the various agronomic packages, but had the least yield. Conversely the agronomic package with the highest yield advantage over the traditional system was the least stable. A major portion of the annual variation in the environmental index for grain yield and total dry matter was attributed to the seasonal variation in rainfall and organic matter depletion. Organic matter levels declined linearly with years of cultivation. Significant differences were found in the rare of depletion between the various agronomic treatments tested. After 11 years, nearly 60% of the organic matter was depleted irrespective of the agronomic treatments.

TI A new research paradigm for sustainability research in Egypt
SO EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
AB Sustainability of intensive irrigated agriculture in Egypt has become a critical issue, as land and water resources are limited on the one hand and population is increasing rapidly on the other. Salinization, heavy input use, nutrient export and pollution all threaten the health of soils that have been feeding Egypt for centuries. At the same time, the build-up of newly reclaimed desert soils to economically sustainable productive capacity is a major challenge. In a collaborative effort between the Agricultural Research Center (ARC) of the Ministry of Agriculture and Land Reclamation in Egypt and the International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA), a long-term resource management programme, Funded by the European Union, has been developed to address the issue of resource management in a multidisciplinary way. Long-term agronomic trials (with such variables as water quantity, water quality, nutrient inputs and crop rotations) have been set up at sites representing the old lands, the newly reclaimed areas and the rainfed areas. These trials are complemented by extensive long-term monitoring in villages close to the experimental sites. This covers farmers' perspectives, farming practices and the condition of farmers' soils and crops and is aimed at identifying over time the sustainable and non-sustainable production practices and the social and economic factors that underline them. The project activities beg an with a Preparatory Phase which comprised inventory studies, rapid rural appraisal and multi-disciplinary surveys. This knowledge was used in the planning of the two closely related activities of long-term trials (LTT) and long-term monitoring (LTM). As the programme was implemented, the complementarity of the LTT and LTM approaches became the most important feature of this programme.

TI Salinity build-up and changes in the rice-wheat system of the
   Indo-Gangetic Plains
SO EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
ID CROP RESPONSES; SODIC SOIL; GYPSUM
AB Green revolution technologies of the 1960s and 1970s have led to the emergence of rice (Oryza sativa)-wheat (Triticum aestivum) (R-W) as a major cropping system in the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP). Expansion of irrigation through a network of canals and privately owned tube wells was one of the key factors in the success of the new technologies. Since canal water supplies are not demand-driven, farmers increasingly relied on the use of ground water by installing shallow tube wells. The strategy of ground water development and its use in conjunction with canal supplies paid rich dividends in control of waterlogging and secondary alkalization and in increasing the pace of alkali soils reclamation programmes in areas underlaid with fresh quality aquifers. Rice-wheat systems were the preferred choice of farmers. Adoption of the R-W system, however, changed the salt and water balance in north-western parts of the IGP. In the north-east of Punjab and Haryana states it led to receding water tables and waterlogging, and in south-west parts to associated problems of secondary salination. In eastern parts of the IGP in West Bengal, development of ground water aquifers to meet irrigation water requirements for the intensification and diversification of agriculture has led to serious problems of ground water contamination due to dissolution of arsenic-bearing minerals under altered soil moisture regimes, conducive to oxidation of pyritic sediments. These experiences suggest that there is an urgent need for a change in the way food is produced in the IGP for sustainability of the natural resource base. This will depend on the ability to predict long-term consequences of intensification and diversification of agriculture on the farm and regional scale. Whereas issues of favourable regional salt and water balances need attention in the north-west of the IGP, rainwater management and alleviating drainage congestion can facilitate the adoption of agricultural technologies and improve productivity of the R-W systems.

AB Since 1978 43 000 ha of clonal plantations have been planted around Pointe-Noire. Due to very low soil fertility in this part of Congo, getting maximum sustainable production is fundamental. The aim of this work was to obtain quantitative data on the biogeochemical functioning of an Eucalyptus ecosystem and to provide relevant information to forest managers. The dynamics of biomass and nutrient accumulation presented herein concerns an important flow in the nutrient cycle. It has been studied using a chronosequence approach for a single clone. Twelve trees were sampled in each of the five stands at ages 1, 2, 4, 5, and 7 (logging age). For the root system, three trees were studied in each of the 1-, 4- and 7-year-old stands. Tables were established to predict biomass and nutrient content from DBH and ages of the trees. They were applied to the inventory of the different stands to evaluate biomass and nutrient content for each component.
   The results exhibit different dynamics of biomass and nutrient accumulation:
   P and Ca accumulation is proportional to biomass of the trees throughout rotation;
   Mg is mainly accumulated during the first and the second year of the rotation, in connection with crown establishment;
   N and K are characterized by an intermediary dynamics, 50% of N and 65% of K have already been accumulated by the time the trees are two years old.
   The models were validated using 18 other trees sampled in the seven-year-old stand of the chronosequence. Nutrient removal by harvesting was also evaluated for different logging scenarios. The results confirm the need to de-bark on-site. This technique reduces the removal of Ca and ME by >50%. The quantities exported with pulpwood and firewood are ca. 100 kg N, 30 kg P, 39 kg K, 33 kg Ca and 19 kg Mg per hectare. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Replicated plantations of Eucalyptus saligna (Sm.) and Albizia falcataria (L.) Fosberg were examined for patterns in soil phosphorus (P) fractions and soil P availability. The supply of P was assessed in the field with anion exchange resin bags, which indicated that P supply was about twice as high under Eucalyptus as under Albizia. In the laboratory, solution P extracted with iron oxide-impregnated paper strips was also 45% higher under Eucalyptus. The effects of mixtures of the two species were intermediate between the pure-species effects. Overall, P supply either increased with Eucalyptus or decreased under Albizia. Despite significantly lower soil P availability, the Albizia plots appeared to take up and cycle as much P as the Eucalyptus plots, indicating that P supply was not independent of P demand. High rates of P uptake by Albizia may depend on higher allocations of carbohydrate to belowground production. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

ID INVENTORY
AB Forest inventory statistics developed by the USDA Forest Service are used by customers ranging from forest industry to state and local economic development groups. In recent years, these statistics have been used increasingly to justify greater utilization of the eastern hardwood resource or to evaluate the sustainability of expanding demand for hardwood roundwood and sawtimber. This paper examines Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) statistics and demonstrates how they can be misinterpreted. In some cases, the total fiber supply can be underestimated because cull trees are not included in estimates of growing stock and sawtimber. In other cases, the use of annualized growth and removal statistics overestimates sustainable harvest levels. Forest researchers and others using FIA data should determine the meaning of inventory statistics for the state and products under study before assessing the degree of sustainability resulting from increased demand by primary forest products manufacturers.

TI Enablements and constraints: Geoffrey Vickers and the politics of
   stability
SO FUTURES
LA English
DT Article
AB Geoffrey Vickers argued that systems both enable and constrain, and that the price of increasing enablements is increasing constraints. His focus on stability, as maintaining the key parameters of a system within critical limits, beyond which it spins off into irreversible change, helps to ground thinking about sustainability. Maintaining the relationships necessary for stability - including the relationship between natural systems and human systems - was a vital responsibility of what Vickers called 'governance'. The amplifiers of choice in the modem world are the operations of the market economy and the development of technology. The expansion of choice and increase in the range of the possible are making heavier demands on governmental regulation, domestic and international. However, trust in the institutions of government has diminished and consensus about values and priorities necessary for good government has eroded. The problems of global interdependence which Vickers identified, particularly the increasing gap between human capabilities and regulatory capacities, national and international, are now much more obvious. The chief obstacle to more effective international regulation is not weak countries but strong ones, particularly the United States, for structural as well as cultural reasons.

TI Sustainable development of agricultural systems: competing objectives
   and critical limits
SO FUTURES
LA English
DT Article
AB The sustainability of agricultural systems has become a major focus for debates about future human survival. Much of the argument appears to rely on simplistic interpretation of ecological models, and fails adequately to define what sustainability objectives are being sought. We explore the implications of two alternative approaches to agricultural sustainability: the Critical Limits view which would require future farming systems to accept the ecosystem-imposed limits on the number of people in the world and the lifestyle they can enjoy; and the Competing Objectives view would balance agricultural sustainability with economic viability, reduction of environmental harm and fulfilling public demands for food and landscape benefits. The development of farming systems of the future will depend on which of these views is adopted by planners and policy makers.
   This paper challenges some of the ecological assumptions underlying the Critical Limits approach and questions the conventional view that extensive farming systems are more sustainable agriculturally than intensive systems. We may be able to deal more effectively with the environmental side effects of intensive farming systems by treating them as unwanted externalities and taking direct action to avoid or remove them rather than attempting to change fundamentally the nature of modern farming systems.
   To cope with the increasingly complexity and inter-connectedness of modem farming systems in the context of globalisation and potential perturbations like climate change, we need a pluralistic approach to policy, which can cope with the high levels of uncertainty in these areas and which allows maximum flexibility of response to changing circumstances.

TI On transport integration: a contribution to better understanding
SO FUTURES
LA English
DT Article
AB Over the years there have been many forecasts of transport futures. Most have taken a technological perspective, but this paper differs. Our perspective, linked to current transport policy debates, concerns the processes, institutions and structures within which transport technologies develop. 'Integration' is taken as our focus, because the concept of 'integrated transport' has become an important guiding principle for transport policies' institutional and structural development in several countries.
   Much has been talked about the need to reduce significantly the environmental impact of transport. While technical solutions that reduce the impact of individual journeys have a place, it is unlikely that they alone can reduce the impact of transport to a sustainable level. Only the development of highly integrated strategies have the potential to improve sustainability. Such strategies involve areas of activity that are not traditionally considered part of the transport planning process, such as health, urban regeneration, and education.
   There is no widely accepted definition of what Integrated Transport means. It is to help clarify such ambiguities that this paper has been written. This paper explores the meaning of Integunted Transport and considers whether such strategies will contribute to sustainability.
   Using examples from photography and computer system design the paper shows that there is a need to develop a better understanding of the meaning of Integrated Transport, outlining a typology developed to classify various definitions of Integrated Transport. Integrated Transport is viewed as scalar in nature, with higher levels incorporating lower, or narrower, understandings of the term Integrated Transport. Points on this scale include:
   Functional or Modal Integration, which is part of...
   Transport and Planning Integration. which is part of...
   Social Integration. which is part of...
   Environmental, Economic and Transport Policy Integration
   Transport integration may be considered as a series of steps, with an incremental approach leading to higher levels of both Integration and Sustainability. Only by commitment, and allocation of resources, to the highest levels, will issues of sustainability be properly addressed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID INNOVATION
AB The concept of sustainable product-service systems has emerged recently, and is distinct from the ideas of cleaner production, eco-design and design for the environment. The concept goes beyond the environmental optimisation of products and processes and requires radical and creative thinking to reduce environmental impacts by a factor of between four and 20 times while maintaining an acceptable quality of service. Sustainable product-services consider alternative socio-technical systems that can provide the essential end-use function, such as warmth or mobility, that an existing product offers. Four types are outlined-result services; shared utilisation services; product-life extension services; and demand side management. Sustainable product-service systems attempt to create designs that are sustainable in terms of environmental burden and resource use, whilst developing product concepts as parts of sustainable whole systems, that provide a service or function to meet essential needs.

TI Institutional sustainability: 'community' and waste management in

SO FUTURES
LA English
DT Article
AB This article addresses sustainability as a social process. In doing so it extends beyond the Brundtland notion of present and 'future generations' to grapple with the divergent social worlds in which the term is constructed by different actors. It is thus concerned with how learning can take place within development interventions to enable actors to build new norms and behaviours which cut across social divides. A framework has been developed to (i) explore and make explicit the assumptions held by stakeholders; (ii) develop an awareness of the nature and practices of accountability; (iii) build an understanding of cause and effect (attribution) in relation to action. It is suggested that structured participation in these processes can help to build inter-organizational and inter-associational learning which can provide the basis for new norms and behaviours stretching beyond the formal life of any intervention (institutional sustainability). The article draws on research from Zimbabwe, however it is suggested that the framework can have applicability in many situations. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

SO FUTURES

DT Article
AB This paper looks at the prospects for using the new information and communications technologies (ICTs) to support sustainable economic activity. It uses systems principles-information flows, control variables and sub-system boundaries-and a biological metaphor-the difference between an ecosystem and an organism-to establish some principles upon which sustainable economic activity could rest. It shows how the new ICTs could be used to implement these principles: how information flows could be used to shift the balance of control of the economy from the needs of the provider towards the needs of the receiver, and how new ICT-mediated groupings could form which are oriented more towards collaboration and community than competition and individualism. The proposed information flows would make explicit the environmental costs of products and activities. The proposed economic structures-local exchange groups-would enable people to base production and services on real costs, including environmental rather than financial costs.

TI The psychodynamics of meaning and action for a sustainable future
SO FUTURES
LA English
DT Article
AB Environmental policy and social research tends to neglect the inner, experiential dimensions of human life. Yet, the ways in which individuals seek to achieve psychological and emotional well-being in their lives is inevitably expressed in behaviour that impacts on ecological land social) processes.
   The yearning for this 'inner human sustainability' is psychologically rooted and subjectively experienced. Beliefs and worldviews about how best to satisfy it are culturally (i.e. intersubjectively and collectively) constructed and expressed through behaviour that, in turn, supports or undermines the external ecological and social world. Consumerism and its associated behaviours are inherently unsustainable socio-ecologically and psychologically. Through a psychodynamic theory of human experience, meaning and behaviour, the paper explains why any policy, if it is to be effective in the long-term, must be attentive to psychological, experiential and cultural dimensions of human beings and beliefs about how needs and wants will be satisfied. It also argues that long-term societal and cultural transformation is only possible when individuals take responsibility for their own development, transformation and engagement in the larger social and ecological complex on which they depend. Policy-making, research and education are themselves cultural activities that seek to respond appropriately to changes in the external world within the constraints of powerful cultural (collective) and psychological (individual) values and priorities. A systemic approach to sustainable development requires consideration of the mutual dependence between eco-social and psyche-cultural realities. (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Markers for eight new microsatellite DNA or simple sequence repeat (SSR) loci were developed and characterized in trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides) from a partial genomic library. Informativeness of these microsatellite DNA markers was examined by determining polymorphisms in 38 P. tremuloides individuals. Inheritance of selected markers was tested in progenies of controlled crosses. Six characterized SSR loci were of dinucleotide repeats (two perfect and four imperfect), and one each of trinucleotide and tetranucleotide repeats. The monomorphic SSR locus (PTR15) was of a compound imperfect dinucleotide repeat. The primers of one highly polymorphic SSR locus (PTR7) amplified two loci, and alleles could not be assigned to a specific locus. At the other six polymorphic loci, 25 alleles were detected in 38 P. tremuloides individuals; the number of alleles ranged from 2 to 7, with an average of 4.2 alleles per locus, and the observed heterozygosity ranged from 0.05 to 0.61, with an average of 0.36 per locus. The two perfect dinucleotide and one trinucleotide microsatellite DNA loci were the most informative. Microsatellite DNA variants of four SSR loci characterized previously followed a single-locus Mendelian inheritance pattern, whereas those of PTR7 from the present study showed a two-locus Mendelian inheritance pattern in controlled crosses. The microsatellite DNA markers developed and reported here could be used for assisting various genetic, breeding, biotechnology, genome mapping, conservation, and sustainable forest management programs in poplars.

AB Together, urbanization and the search for sustainable development present a dilemma in the Brazilian Amazon: how to accommodate an expanding urban population while creating and maintaining sustainable production systems that feed the people and manage the forest. A unique peri-urban agroforestry project, implemented by a municipal government in western Amazonia and concerned with a citywide influx of rural agriculturalists and former forest-dwelling extractive producers, is examined as a source of food and self-determination. Peri-urban agroforestry seems to be a viable option for other Amazonian cities that are experiencing increasing urbanization and its associated problems.

SO GEOGRAPHY
LA English
DT Article
AB Since the 1970s, trends in environmental regulation, demand and industrial organisation seemed to be pushing major European urban regions towards sourcing a growing proportion of their aggregates requirements from beyond their borders, encouraging interest in massive 'superquarries' located in remote coastal areas. In practice, this anticipated expansion of international trade in crushed rock! has been slow to materialise: a downswing in demand in England and Germany has coincided with public resistance to coastal superquarry development in parts of northern Europe. Future trends in aggregates sourcing will( likewise depend on the interplay between,een economic processes and policies for sustainable development across all levels of government. Any future increase in the international trade in crushed rock is likely, to be supplied from existing coastal quarrying locations, especially in Norway.

SO GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS

DT Article
DE climate change; co-evolution; indicators; socio-economic scenarios
AB Climate change policies currently pay disproportionately greater attention to the mitigation of climate change through emission reductions strategies than to adaptation measures. Realising that the world is already committed to some global warming, policy makers are beginning to turn their attention to the challenge of preparing society to adapt to the unfolding impacts at the local level. This two-part article presents an integrated, or 'co-evolutionary', approach to using scenarios in adaptation and vulnerability assessment. Part I explains how climate and social scenarios can be integrated to better understand the inter-relationships between a changing climate and the dynamic evolution of social, economic and political systems. The integrated scenarios are then calibrated so that they can be applied 'bottom up' to local stakeholders in vulnerable sectors of the economy. Part I concludes that a co-evolutionary approach (1) produces a more sophisticated and dynamic account of the potential feedbacks between natural and human systems; (2) suggests that sustainability indicators are both a potentially valuable input to and an output of integrated scenario formulation and application. Part II describes how a broadly representative sample of public, private and voluntary organisations in the East Anglian region of the UK responded to the scenarios, and identifies future research priorities.

ID CHEMICAL BATH DEPOSITION; THIN-FILMS; CDS
AB Chemical Bath Deposition (CBD) is a useful method for the deposition of thin films of semiconductors such as CdS, which are important components of polycrystalline solar cells. Such devices potentially offer low cost solar energy conversion which are interesting sustainable energy sources. We are attempting to reduce the environmental impact on the fabrication of such devices by developing routes in which cadmium is used efficiently in the deposition of films. At present the fabrication of CdS window layers by CBD generates considerable quantities of cadmium-containing waste and the incorporation of cadmium into the films accounts for only a small fraction of the total used in the process. The use and disposal of cadmium-containing compounds is highly regulated in the EU and elsewhere. In CBD, the extent of the heterogeneous film formation process is limited by two major factors: homogeneous reaction in solution (precipitation) and the deposition of material on to the reactor walls. In this paper we describe the development of a novel high-efficiency CdS CBD system, using concentrations of cadmium orders of magnitude lower than in previously reported methods. The modelling of chemical equilibria have enabled us to develop this method which also offers the potential to eliminate ammonia (which is volatile and undesirable for large-scale CBD operations). Films have been characterized as good quality CdS by spectroscopic methods (UV-VIS, PL and XPS), microscopy (SEM and TEM) and powder XRD.

AB A 2-year field project was conducted in Thermal, Calif,, to investigate cowpea [Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.] mulch as an alternative weed control option in pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) production. Treatments included: bare ground (BG) with hand weeding, BG with no weeding, cowpea mulch (CM) with hand weeding, and CM with no weeding. Cowpea was seeded in July on 76-cm beds and irrigated with buried drip line. Two weeks prior to transplanting peppers, irrigation water was turned off to desiccate the cowpea plants, In September, cowpea was cut at the soil line, mulch was returned to the top of the bed, and pepper plants were transplanted into the mulch and fertilized through the drip line, Every 2 weeks, the number of weeds emerged and pepper plant height were recorded. Fruit production, pepper plant dry weight, and weed dry weight were recorded at harvest in December. Fewer weeds emerged in CM than in BG, The final weed population in nonweeded CM was reduced 80% and 90% in comparison with nonweeded BG in 1997 and 1998, respectively. Weed dry weights in nonweeded CM were 67% and 90% less than those in nonweeded BG over the same period,In 1997 and 1998, respectively, pepper plants produced 202% and 156% more dry weight, as well as greater fruit weight, in CM than in BG, There were no differences in mean fruit weight, Cowpea mulch provided season-long weed control without herbicides while promoting plant growth and fruit production.

AB During the 20th century, environmental problems have increased from sewage discharge in the first decennia towards climate change today. An increase in scale of threats implies an increase in scale of management and assessment. Successively, physico-chemical, biological and ecological assessment evolved but failed to stop deterioration. The development in techniques runs parallel to the evolution in assessment. Eight major groups of assessment techniques are distinguished: indices (saprobic, diversity, biotic), multimetrics and rapid techniques, physico-ecological, catchment scale, ecosystem components, assemblage/community, process, and non-taxonomic assessment. An increasing refinement is observed in objectives, measures and complexity, and a decreasing one in levels of scale, stream type and, more often, taxonomy. The applied algorithms were typically restricted to single summary measures. Multivariate analysis was introduced only recently. Assessment can do without a reference condition. Still, this condition is often used in assessment. Therefore, the role of the reference is discussed and it is concluded that, if used, it needs to be defined strictly. The role of nine concepts of lotic ecology in assessment is studied. Two major groups of concepts are distinguished. One is related to catchment-scale functioning of streams and the other to instream habitat-related processes and biodiversity. The 5-S-Model, a frame that divides the stream ecosystem into five major components: system conditions, stream hydrology, structures, substances and species (Verdonschot et al., 1998: The 5-S-Model, an integrated approach for stream rehabilitation. In H.O. Hansen & B.L. Madsen, River Restoration '96, Session lectures proceedings. National Environmental Research Institute, Denmark, International Conference arranged by the European Centre for River Restoration: 36-44), is a first attempt to comprise this knowledge in management. Finally, integrated ecological assessment is defined. It is based on three major approaches: an ecological typology approach, an ecological catchment approach and a societal approach. Ecological typology implies a nested multiple parameter approach based on regional ecological stream typology where types are scaled and different taxonomic groups are incorporated. Ecological typology sets the ecological demands necessary to make management sustainable. The ecological catchment approach implies a nested multiple scale approach which couples natural and anthropogenic features and dynamics of the catchment both in space and time. This approach sets the conditions within the catchment to facilitate sustainable catchment management. The societal approach adds human activities to the first two. It couples ecological demands and anthropogenic uses and supports those user choices that make management sustainable. The application of these three approaches is initiated to enable sustainable catchment management.

ID ECOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE
AB There is a difficult polarity between reality and ecologically desirable goals of stream ecosystem management in Switzerland. Most streams are exposed to a variety of impacts. Due to a high intensity of anthropogenic activity there is a high pressure on land and water use. Essential water uses have to be guaranteed. On the other hand there is also a strong need to preserve or restore (bring back ecological integrity) or rehabilitate streams (bring back 'relative ecological integrity'). Stream assessment should, therefore, produce sound data suitable for characterizing the ecological condition of streams and for supporting their sustainable management. The methods should include a system approach as the basic unit and sound scientific principles of ecological integrity emphasizing habitat connectivities. The methods should allow: . the condition of streams to be rationally described and judged, . identification of different kind of impacts on a stream, . verification of the effects of water protection measures, . identification of suitable future actions in the context of a whole stream system. In order to cover the various requirements a modular concept for stream system-oriented analysis was developed. Altogether nine modules are elaborated. Each module deals with specific stream features (two hydrodynamic and ecomorphological modules, five biological modules, two chemical and ecotoxicological modules). Single modules, several modules, or all of them may be applied, depending on the purpose of the analysis. For each module a cost-effective survey procedure (rapid method) and a progressively more rigorous method providing more detailed information is suggested. Based on the result of the analysis, stream rehabilitation concepts can then be elaborated in cooperation with managers, river engineers and biologists.

AB The 1992 Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) challenged signatory countries to seek and encourage new financial resources, including private-sector resources, to implement the objectives of the Convention. During the past decade, pioneering businesses have succeeded at making money while conserving and sustainably using biodiversity. What lessons have we learned! How can we speed up the adoption of biodiversity-friendly business activities' Where and how can additional private investment for biodiversity conservation and sustainable use be found! To answer these questions, this article reviews why biodiversity conservation needs private-sector finance. It defines the beneficial links between business and biodiversity; presents the business rationale for financing conservation and sustainable use; identifies who is currently investing in these businesses; and outlines the conditions necessary to attract considerably more amounts of private-sector financing for biodiversity conservation and sustainable use.

TI Biodiversity and business: coming to terms with the 'grand bargain'
SO INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
LA English
DT Article
ID DRUG
AB The Convention on Biological Diversity incorporates an exchange that has been described as a 'grand bargain' which balances the needs of both technologically and biologically endowed countries. The role of genetic resources in R&D and sales varies by industry sector, however, so it is difficult to generalize on company demand for genetic resources and fair and equitable benefit-sharing. It is important, therefore, to examine the particular features of industry R&D programmes, providers of genetic resources, and trends in benefit-sharing partnerships in specific industry sectors. This article examines markets for genetic resources, costs and duration of R&D, types of genetic resources accessed, providers of genetic resources and benefit-sharing partnerships in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, crop protection, seed, botanical medicine, horticulture, and personal care and cosmetic industries.
   The article concludes that experience and 'best practice' in benefit-sharing have progressed quite significantly on a number of fronts in the past decade, including the development of corporate: policies in response to the CBD. The most effective form of benefit-sharing, and realization of the 'grand bargain' envisaged by the CBD, is found through partnerships between private-sector and source-country institutions thar link commercial use with sustainable development and biodiversity conservation.

ID CONSERVATION
AB Agricultural biodiversity is critical for food security throughout the world. At the genetic, species, and firming systems levels, biodiversity provides valuable ecosytems services and functions for agricultural production. Wow can the erosion of agrobiodiversity be halted? How can it effectively be conserved and enhanced?
   This article highlights key principles, policies, and practices for the sustainable use, conservation and enhancement of agrobiodiversity for sustaining food security. After clarifying the serious threats from the global loss of agrobiodiversity, the article summarizes practical guidelines and lessons for biodiversity management in farming systems and landscapes. Such st strategies build upon valuable local experiences and knowledge in traditional fanning practices, and they also take advantage of recent scientific findings in agroecology and ecosystem health. There is an urgent need to adopt an agroecosytems approach, beyond a focus on genetic resource conservation alone, to implement other biodiversity-enhancing methods in farms, such as integrated ecological pest and sail management. Conflicting agricultural politics that promote monocultural Industrial firming models and uniform technology packages need to be eliminated. In addition, the protection of intellectual property rights is vital for those who have knowledge of the values and uses of such biodiversity, particularly for indigenous peoples and small farmers. The approaches reviewed in this analysis show effective ways to conserve, use and enhance biodiversity that will encourage sustainable food security.

AB In Pakistan. Hystrix indica is abundant and distributed all over the country. It has been identified as a serious pest of traditional as well as non-traditional crops, fruit orchards, vegetables, flowering plants and grasses of forage importance in rangelands. The most important porcupine damage, however, occurs in forestry and reforestation areas. Damage estimates of 52.5% to Melia azedarach, 24.3% to Morus alba and 1% to Dalbergia sissoo in different irrigated forest plantations of Punjab has been described. Severe stocking damage of 60% to Pinus roxburghii and 42% to Robinia pseudoacacia was recorded in different areas of Tarbela Watershed Management Project. Crops of economic importance such as maize, groundnut and potatoes are severely damaged in irrigated plains and mountain regions. Among the vegetables, okra, pumpkin, bitter gourd, and onions are badly damaged. In rangelands different species of grasses such as Pennisetum sp., Cenchrus ciliaris and Cymbopogan jawarancusa are uprooted which severely affects sustainable grazing. Dirt raised embankments of link and irrigational canals have become weakened because of the most favourable denning sites for the porcupines. Damage to plastic tubing is common where drip irrigation is practised. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this article major environmental problems and their different levels and global spheres of impact are surveyed. Environmental exploitation is discussed as an inherent characteristic of free market economies under limited cognitive-motivational inclinations of individual actors. A conceptual modelling of environmental problem solving is presented, which comprises the commons dilemma paradigm as well as a needs-opportunities-abilities (NOA) model of consumer behaviour, a categorization of human needs, a simple taxonomy of behavioural processes, and seven strategies for behaviour change. Six lines of psychological research are identified, ranging from environmental attitudes to environmental policy-decision support systems. An ecological critique of mainstream psychology is summarized and some suggestions are made to resolve this. Conclusions are drawn about needed research, policy making, and international diplomacy.

DE fruit tree; nutrient uptake; nutrient balance; application rate of
   fertilizer; sustainable agriculture
AB The consumption of chemical fertilizers in 1996 amounted to 511,700 t for nitrogen (U), 610,100 t for phosphorus (P2O5), 441,200 t for potassium (K2O). The area of orchard fields was 314,900 ha in 1995 and the ratio to the total cultivated area was 6.4%. If the same amount of chemical fertilizer is applied to each field, the total application to orchard fields should be 32,700 t for nitrogen, 39,000 t for phosphorus and 28,200 t for potassium, respectively. In this report, we estimated the input of chemical fertilizers to orchard fields based on the results of official surveys of orchard area and the standard application rate based on the cultivation guidelines adopted in 37 prefectures. In 1995, the input for main fruit tree species amounted to 50,600 t for nitrogen, 36,400 t for phosphorus and 40,700 t for potassium. The output of nutrients from the orchard fields was estimated based on the results of field experiments for the nutrient uptake of fruit trees as follows: 39,800 t for nitrogen, 9,100 t for phosphorus and 35,300 t for potassium for mature fruit-bearing trees. The ratio of estimated input to output was 1.3 for nitrogen, 4.5 for phosphorus and 1.2 for potassium, respectively. These results indicate that the amount of chemical fertilizer application to the orchard fields may be appropriate for nitrogen and potassium but is excessive for phosphorus. However the total nutrient balance was not calculated exactly in Japanese orchard fields because the total nutrient input could not be determined owing to the paucity of statistical data on organic matter application and also the total output could not be calculated due to the paucity of field experimental data.

ID GROWTH
AB To analyze the sustainability and carrying capacity of a mangrove forest, we studied the profiles of species composition and biomass from the riverside to inland. A belt transect (25x180 m) divided into 9 plots was established in compartment 46, in the Matang Mangrove Forest Reserve, Perak, Peninsular Malaysia. Five tree species were distributed in the transect. Rhizophora apiculata showed the highest density, followed by Bruguiera parviflora, B. sexangula, R. mucronata and Avicenia alba. From the riverside to inland, the structure changed from pure R. apiculata stands to mixed Rhizophora-Bruguiera stands. The mean aboveground biomass of all the plots was 316 Mg ha(-1). The largest and smallest volumes for biomass were 558 Mg ha(-1) on the riverside and 144 Mg ha(-1) inland, respectively. The values tended to be higher in R. apiculata-dominant stands. If a larger productive area could be set up where R. apiculata would predominate, i.e. an area at a lower ground level, a larger sustainable amount of biomass for firewood and charcoal use could be produced. The annual dead biomass, which is supplied to the forest floor as nutrients for aquatic life, was 5.1 Mg ha(-1). While stocked biomass is more valuable to a local economy than the dead biomass, the contribution of the fallen trees (dead biomass) to habitats and nutrients for aquatic life must be evaluated exactly in the future.

ID FRESH-WATER
AB Freshwater is renewable but finite. Over the next 50 years, world population growth will reduce the renewable water supply per capita by approximately one third. By 2025, an estimated 3 billion people - 38 percent of the projected global population - will live in countries classified as water-stressed. In many regions, numerous signs that water use is not sustainable are already in evidence in the widespread overpumping of aquifers and excessive depletion of river flows. Meeting the water demands of 8 - 9 billion people while at the same time protecting the health of the aquatic environment will greatly challenge water professionals. This article makes the case for a new water management paradigm - one that strives to balance water's economic and ecological functions. A key to success is increasing water productivity, i.e., doing more with less water.

Since then, nearly 400 WFP projects have been completed, benefiting rural and urban communities in 38 developing and transitioning countries. To be eligible, projects must address critical needs, use appropriate technology and local materials, and be sustainable by the community. To facilitate projects and make the most of limited funding and resources, WFP partners with indigenous private institutions, public agencies, and nongovernmental organizations. As WFP enters a new century, the organization is evolving to meet the changing needs of communities acid investing more in education, training, and basic skills to help people help themselves.

TI Village water supply in Botswana: assessment of recommended yield for
   production boreholes in a semi-arid environment
SO JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article; Proceedings Paper
CT Conference for the 50th Anniversary of the Geological Survey of Botswana
CY 1998
CL BOTSWANA
AB More than 90% of the rural villages and settlements throughout Botswana have water supplies based on groundwater. The annual increase in water demand is about 0.3 x 10(6) m(3) and on average around 60 new boreholes are needed annually. In parallel with construction of new production boreholes for rural villages, there is an on-going rehabilitation of existing boreholes which have lost their original yield due to clogging, corrosion, encrustation, etc. The total annual cost of siting, drilling and testing of around 100 new production boreholes for rural villages water supply is estimated at around US$7.5 million (1997 price).
   Modelling of every groundwater resource for rural village water supply in Botswana is currently not feasible due to a lack of relevant and detailed information. A modelling exercise will assess the resource of the aquifer being studied, but can not give an assessment of the yield of each production borehole. Groundwater supply to rural villages is therefore currently based on the abstraction possible from established production boreholes. Test pumping data from these boreholes are the prime information in such an assessment. However safety factors and the fact that drought periods of longer duration are common in a semi-arid environment must also be considered. A computer program package TESTCURV developed by the Department of Water Affairs is a most useful tool in the assessment of yields for production boreholes for village water supply in Botswana, based on the performance of the well and the aquifer. No replenishment is assumed and the question of sustainable yield is not addressed by the program. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Limited. All rights reserved.

TI Vegetation response to grazing management in a Mediterranean herbaceous
   community: a functional group approach

AB 1. A 4-year study was conducted in a Mediterranean herbaceous community in north-eastern Israel to investigate the effects of cattle grazing management on the structure and composition of the community. Understanding the effects of grazing on the dynamics of Mediterranean herbaceous communities is important in formulating rational management plans for both conservation and sustainable animal production.
   2. The relationships among plant functional groups were studied in the context of inter-annual variation in rainfall. Treatments included manipulations of stocking rates (moderate, heavy and very heavy) and grazing regimes (continuous vs. seasonal), in a factorial design.
   3. The herbaceous community was rich in species, with 166 species recorded at the site, of which 74% were annuals. Plant cover was dominated by 10 species that accounted for 75% of the total cover.
   4. Inter-seasonal rainfall variation was a dominant factor in the expression of different grazing treatments on the structure of the plant community. Grazing effects were stronger in wet years than in dry years.
   5. Paddocks under continuous grazing were higher in number of species compared with paddocks subjected to seasonal grazing, independently of grazing intensity.
   6. Functional group analyses showed that reduction in cover of tall grasses was correlated with an increase in cover of prostrate annual legumes and less palatable groups such as annual and perennial thistles, crucifers and forbs.
   7. Cover of functional groups composed of hemicryptophytic species was less variable (lower coefficient of variation) in response to grazing treatments and inter-annual variation in climatic conditions compared with functional groups with annual species.
   8. The persistence of the dominant species and the relatively small amplitude of change in plant cover of the functional groups suggest that the community was rather stable in spite of wide variation in grazing regimes and climatic conditions. East-Mediterranean grasslands appear to be adapted to grazing due to their long history of human association.

SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS

DT Article
ID STAKEHOLDER THEORY; FRAMEWORK; ETHICS
AB Enterprise strategy provides an accepted theoretical framework for integrating the moral responsibilities of organizations into their strategy formulation and implementation processes. We argue that, when extended to the ecological level of analysis, enterprise strategy provides a sound theoretical framework for ethically and strategically accounting for the ultimate stakeholder, planet Earth. Within the framework of enterprise strategy, a value system based on sustainability can provide a sound ethical basis for developing ecologically sensitive strategic management systems which allow organizations to satisfy the demands of the myriad green stakeholders that represent the planet in the immediate business arena. This provides a new "flavor" of enterprise strategy in which organizations "stand for sustainability." We call this new flavor "eco-enterprise strategy."

DT Article
AB In an empirical investigation of the interactions between industrial structure and macro outcomes, an accounting framework was applied to relate changes in sectoral employment and output compositions to changes in overall productivity growth over time. The numerical results were interpreted using a taxonomy describing industrialisation and deindustrialisation in developing countries. The findings suggest that, in particular, industrial performance correlates with the overall performance of an economy and therefore is the key sector in explaining the sustainability of different regional patterns in overall productivity and employment growth. That is, negative rates of productivity growth in the industrial sector are strongly associated with negative productivity growth for the economy as a whole, and vice versa. Further slow industrial growth may lead to low road development, in which productivity growth trades off with employment growth, while high road development is defined as simultaneously expanding employment and overall productivity growth.

TI Employment, structural adjustment and sustainable growth in Mexico
SO JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
AB The impact of slow growth since the early 1980s on the Mexican labour market is analysed by comparing Mexico's employment performance to that of other OECD countries ies through three different components, that is, the labour force participation ratio, occupational structure and output per worker. The 'old' employment components of Mexico's development problem - low participation ratios and a high employment share of agriculture have remained, to which is added a new employment problem in the form of a massive increase irt underemployment in the tertiary sectors of the economy driving down wages for a large part of the population. This article mises two sets of questions. First, given the current employment problems and the prospective expansion of rile labour force, what are output and employment growth rates, and the related pattern of structural change, required to prevent a worsening of underemployment and income distribution? Second, given Mexico's debt problems since the early 1980s, what is the output growth rate that,I would make the path of the debt-output ratio sustainable over time? And how do these grow th prospects compare to the investment and external finance requirements associated to a socially necessary growth rate?

TI The structure of employment and structural adjustment in the Philippines
SO JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES

DT Article
AB Growth in the 1970s seemed, at that rime, to have brought the Philippines to a rather high equilibrium growth path. But the foreign debt and political crisis in the early and mid-1980s had brought the economy down to a lower equilibrium path. The recovery! years (1987 to 1990) did nor prove to be sustainable, given the extreme debt overhang, so that the economy retreated once again to the lower equilibrium path in the early 1990s. Significant debt reduction schemes and the new inflows (remittances of overseas workers and rising foreign investments) allow ed a new growth trend. Whether sufficient growth can be maintained in the medium and long term will depend to a large part On uncontrollable external conditions. Significant improvements in trade and industrial policies are needed so that external deficits and imports will finance those sectors that allow for creation of high quality employment. Policy Il,ill have to shift resources away from the trade, real estate and other service sectors to strong tradeable manufactures. if the Philippines cannot get out of the boom-bust cycle, labour productivity in the medium and long term will stagnate and the share of those employed in the total labour force will remain stable, leading to stagnating enzployment opportunities and worsening income distribution.

DE collusion; evolution of industries; group processes among executives
AB This paper considers non-economic factors involved in the occurrence and sustainability of collusion. Group development among executives of incumbent firms created during the evolution of an industry can stimulate collusion, even in the uncertain introduction stage of a new industry. Certain social conditions and social characteristics of executives related to the industry characteristics of entry barriers and geographical structure help to explain differences in group development relevant to collusion. A historical analysis of four transportation industries illustrates the manner in which the non-economic factors operate. (C)2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Intensive forest management practices have been shown to increase tree growth and shorten rotation time. However, they may also lead to an increased need for insect pest management because of higher infestation levels and lower action thresholds. To investigate the relationship between intensive management practices and insect infestation, maximum growth potential studies of loblolly pine, Pinus taeda L., were conducted over 4 yr using a hierarchy of cultural treatments. The treatments were herbaceous weed control (H), H + irrigation (I), H + I + fertilizer (F), and H + I + F + pest control (P). These treatments were monitored for differences in growth and insect infestation levels related to the increasing management intensities, The Nantucket pine tip moth, Rhyacionia frustrana (Comstock), was consistently found infesting study trees. In the third field season, the H + I + F + P treatment had significantly more southern Dine coneworm, Dioryctria amatella (Hulst), attacks than the H and H + I treatments. There were significant differences in volume index (DPH! among all treatments after each of the four growing seasons. This study indicated that tl ee fertilization can increase coneworm infestation and demonstrated that tip moth management can improve tree growth initially. Future measurements will determine if the growth gains from tip moth management are transitory or sustainable.

AB Pollution resulting from increased human activities is threatening Lake Victoria, its effects being characterised by eutrophication and the occurrence of dramatically low dissolved oxygen levels. This study applies a system of pollution inventory methods to estimate waste loads from pollution sources on the basis of functional variables and pollution intensities. Penetration factors are used to incorporate the effects of treatment facilities and of natural 'purification' in rivers and wetlands. The application of a basic error analysis provides insight into the reliability of results. A one-dimensional model is applied to assess the overall nutrient balance.
   Results show that biological oxygen demand (BOD) load is highest on the Kenyan side. Domestic BOD loads exceed industrial loads in all regions, and management policies should therefore be directed primarily towards a reduction of domestic pollution. It was concluded that through effective operation of existing treatment facilities alone BOD loads on the Kenyan side could be reduced by 50%.
   Nutrient input appears to originate mainly from atmospheric deposition and land runoff, together accounting for approximately 90% of phosphorous and 94% of nitrogen input into the lake. The increase in eutrophication is most probably due to an increase in nutrient input from these sources, as a result of increased human activities in the lake surroundings, such as land exploitation for agriculture and forest burning. Policies for sustainable development in the region, including restoration and preservation of the lake's ecosystem, should therefore be directed towards improved land-use practices and a control over land clearing and forest burning.

AB Geomorphologically appropriate rehabilitation measures were proposed to enhance the in-stream environment of the lowland River Idle, north Nottinghamshire, UK. However, the River Idle has multifunctional management requirements including those of flood defence so environmental enhancement must be pursued without significantly increasing the flood risk. Hydraulic testing of rehabilitation proposals is complicated because of the stringent assumptions about flow and morphology in 'traditional' hydraulic models. While new generation two- and three-dimension hydraulic models may overcome some of these problems, they are extremely data intensive, require advanced modelling capabilities and are, therefore, very expensive to apply. Also, they do not yet predict morphology-flow interactions adequately. As an alternative, several simple hydraulic models were applied to test the rehabilitation proposals, based on a fitness-for-purpose criterion.
   BENDFLOW was applied to fine tune the optimal siting of measures and to estimate the additional near-bank scour generated by proposed bend re-profiling. HMODEL2 and the FCFA method were used to test the impact on local channel conveyance capacities and HECRAS was applied to simulate the impact of the proposals on regional flood defence. Indicative results from the testing suggested a maximum increase in near-bank scour of 0.15 m in re-profiled bends, a loss of approximately 10% in flood conveyance locally due to deflector installation or reed and tree planting, and a 0.12 m increase in flood stage within the reach for a 15 year flood. The modelling results were acceptable to the management authority as an indication of an acceptable compromise between flood defence and conservation interests, and construction of the measures followed in 1996. It is clearly that it will require the results of post-project monitoring to indicate whether compromises made to the rehabilitation initiatives in order to satisfy flood defence requirements have unduly reduced their environmental enhancement potential but, for assessing the proposed methods, the models are recommended for use other lowland river environments.

AB The process performance and metabolic rates of samples of activated sludge dosed with vitamin supplements have been compared. After initial screening, four vitamins and two metals as single supplements and in pairs, were dosed continuously into the mixed liquor of an activated sludge simulation. Toxicity, oxygen demand removal, respiration rates and suspended solids were measured to monitor the effect on process efficiency. It was confirmed experimentally that an industrial wastewater stream did not contain a sufficient supply of micronutrients for efficient biological treatment. This was concluded from the observation that Control sludge batches (receiving no supplements) aver aged chemical oxygen demand removal efficiency of 58%. Dosing micronutrients into the mixed liquor produced removal efficiencies of up to 69%. Some of the supplements increased the respiration rate of the sludge while some decreased it, indicating a range of stimulatory and inhibitory effects. Complex interactions between micronutrients that were dosed simultaneously were evident. Several positive effects led to the conclusion that micronutrients have the potential to optimise process performance of activated sludge plants treating industrial wastewater. The addition of phosphorus/niacin and molybdenum/lactoflavin removed wastewater components that were toxic to nitrifiers as indicated through toxicity testing, thus protecting downstream nitrification/denitrification treatment processes.

AB This study presents an overview of the Holocene formation and evolution of the coastal system of Thermaikos Gulf (NW Aegean Sea). The system is divided into the terrestrial sub-system and the oceanic sub-system; the former represents 90%, while the latter includes only 10% of the total area. This particular coastal zone includes the second most important socio-economic area of Greece and in the southern Balkans, the Thessaloniki region; this is in terms of population concentration(> 1 million people), industry, agriculture, aquaculture, trade and services. The geomorphology of the coastal zone is controlled by sediment inputs, nearshore water circulation, and the level of wave activity. The large quantities of sediments (with yields > 500 tonnes/km(2) per year), delivered annually by the main rivers (Axios, Aliakmon, Pinios, and Gallikos) and other seasonal streams are responsible for the general progradation of the coastline and the formation of the Holocene sedimentary cover over the seabed of the Gulf. Changes to the coastline can be identified on macro- and meso-time scales; the former include the evolution of the deltaic plains (at >1 km(2)/year), while the latter incorporates seasonal changes along sections of the coastline (e.g. sandy spits), mostly due to the anthropogenic activities. The overall water circulation pattern in Thermaikos Gulf is characterised by northerly water movement, from the central and eastern part of the Gulf; this is compensated by southerly movement along its western part. The prevailing climate (winds and pressure systems) appears to control the surface water circulation, while near-bed current measurements reveal a general moderate (<15 cm/s) southerly flow, i.e. offshore, towards the deep water Sporades Basin. Waves approaching from southerly directions play also a role in controlling the shoreline configuration. Various human activities within the coastal system place considerable pressure on the natural evolution of the coastal zone ecosystem, Thus, the construction of darns along the routes of the main rivers has reduced dramatically the water/sediment fluxes; this caused, for example, retreat of the deltaic coastlines and seawater intrusion into the groundwater aquifers. Similarly, pollution and/or eutrophication of the nearshore marine environment have resulted from the inputs of industrial wastes, urban untreated sewage, and agricultural activities on the coastal plains. This effect is demonstrated by high levels of pollutants, nutrients, and by the increased concentrations of non-residual trace-metals within the surficial sediments. Finally, climatic changes associated with a potential rise in sea level (i.e. 30-50 cm) will threaten a substantial part of the low-lying lands of Thermaikos Gulf. Thus, systematic and thorough monitoring is needed in order to protect the coastal ecosystem; this will ensure its sustainable development and successful management, in relation to present and future socio-economic activities and climatic changes.

AB The last decade has witnessed a dramatic and fundamental shift in the expenditure and taxation policies of many western democracies, a shift unprecedented in peacetime history. Balanced budgets have virtually disappeared from the scene. In their place, deficit financing has arisen as an alternative for many countries, becoming a focus of both professional interest and public debate. The current literature has examined this issue by assessing the likelihood that governments violate their intertemporal budget constraint. This paper takes a different tack. We incorporate permanent fiscal deficits into an overlapping generations model and evaluate the implications. We already know that if the steady-state interest rate is less than the growth rate then permanent deficits are indeed sustainable. However, this is a necessary but not a sufficient condition. In addition, these deficits and the current stock of debt must also not be 'too big'. We calibrate the model to U.S. data with plausible parameters of taste and technology, derive the theoretical limit to the maximal sustainable deficit implied by this model, and discuss the relevance of our findings for current policy issues.

AB Descriptive studies have been the core of plankton ecology for many decades and will surely be fruitful in the years to come. However, the results that they provide are usually very difficult to adapt for predictive purposes. Other approaches will have to be taken into account, in the same way that the use of chlorophyll a has been used as an analogue in eutrophication studies. Ecological goal functions are the most recent candidates to fulfil the need for such compounded variables in plankton research. These relate some high-order ecological functions (energy flow, information, food web interactions) to ecosystem performance and can be considered as indices of ecological self-organization. Our study applies the concept of goal functions, which are functions that can describe the direction of ecosystem development, to lake plankton. Thirteen gravel pit lakes in Central Spain, without planktivorous fish and differing in trophic status, have been selected; their plankton communities, along with abiotic factors, have been studied during late-season mixing and mid-stratification. Size-spectral features (slope and intercept of the normalized biomass size spectrum), emergy (the quality of energy that increases since it is capable of controlling and causing work in the pelagic environment that would otherwise not be possible), exergy (the actual free energy of plankton biomass, including the free energy stored in information) and size-based connectance of food webs have been calculated on plankton data. Both emergy and exergy changed in response to mixing and stratification, emergy clearly increasing with water temperature. Exergy related to trophic status, whereas emergy only showed such a relationship in late mixing. The intercept of the size spectrum could be a good predictor of both goal functions during stratification. Connectance did not vary statistically between thermal periods. The hypothesis that connectance peaks at intermediate levels of trophic gradient no longer proved sustainable. Also, our data and those of other authors reveal that, despite earlier suggestions, no relationship exists between the slope of the size spectrum and trophic status. Some evidence suggests that goal functions, and hence self-organization, explain more than half of plankton biomass variability in lakes in summer. Exergy can be useful as a synthetic variable in plankton seasonal and long-term changes, emergy being a good proxy of pelagic ecosystem health, overall productivity and the food web. Thus, the application of goal functions along with size spectra to plankton field studies appears to be promising.

SO JOURNAL OF PLANT NUTRITION AND SOIL SCIENCE

DT Article
DE soil fertility; yield giving capacity; soil quality; soil culture
ID QUALITY
AB This paper is based on an extensive review of soil fertility in the literature of soil science, agronomy and ethnic studies. The spectrum of scientific opinions on soil fertility was visualized in mind-maps, definition types were analyzed, and problems within the conceptual approach towards soil fertility were shown. Differently oriented concepts were divided between the terms of soil fertility and soil quality. Soil fertility is not applicable as a technical term in natural sciences as it describes a definite, but dispositional (concealed), soil feature; therefore, it is not fully operationalizable for the natural sciences.
   Soil quality denotes undefined and interchangeable sets of appreciated soil attributes and functionalities, which are assigned by value judgements. It is a tool that integrates different soil state variables and functions in order to evaluate the capacity of a soil to do what it is expected (i.e. function) or to assess the sustainability of current land-use practices.
   The phenomenon of soil fertility appears to the consciousness as an autonomous counter-instance with its own mental and material qualities, referred to in traditional cultic cultivation. The main features of cultic cultivation of soil fertility are the uniting of the four elements, the religio towards the spiritual side of nature, the sacrificial, and the eros.
   A reevaluation of the soil fertility phenomenon in modern terms would be an innovative and forward-looking research program. Practical and scientific work on soil fertility should rediscover and revive the feeling for, and apperception of, the phenomenon of soil fertility in its mental and material aspects.

TI Examining sustainable competitive advantage in intercollegiate

SO JOURNAL OF SPORT MANAGEMENT

ID ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE; MANAGEMENT; FIRM
AB This paper addresses the determinants of intercollegiate athletic program success. We built our arguments on a recent development in the strategic management literature, the Resource-Based View (RBV) of the firm. Our purpose was to investigate the source of sustainable intercollegiate athletic program success. in making our arguments, we briefly reviewed the RBV literature and addressed appropriate success criteria for intercollegiate athletics programs. An exploratory investigation of Pennsylvania State University's football program led to the conclusion that the resources responsible for its enduring competitive advantage are the history, relationships, trust, and organizational culture that have developed within the program's coaching staff. An organization that possesses such organizational resources may sustain a competitive advantage by exploiting its human and physical resources more completely than other organizations. The paper concludes with discussions of the potential generalizability of our findings, their implications for theory and practice, and suggested future research directions.

AB Irrigation is a small but important part of UK agriculture, accounting for about 150 000 ha of land and 160 000 Ml of water in a 'dry' year By the year 2021, the irrigated area is predicted to increase by 14% and the volume applied by 50%. Irrigation is of significant economic importance to (a) farmers, (b) growers, (c) the food industry - improving crop yields, quality, consistency and reliability.
   The environmental impacts of irrigation on river flows and wetland biodiversity are now receiving more attention. Irrigators are given advice on environmental impacts, voluntary agreements are secured between groups of irrigators and the Environment Agency, and on-farm reservoirs are constructed to reduce summer abstraction and provide more secure and flexible supplies. Better lone-term management are essential.

DE coastal defence; planning; shoreline; sustainable development
AB If a shoreline management plan is to lead to sustainable coastal defences, a long-term strategic view is necessary This paper examines the issues which are involved in shoreline management planning and the role of the planning system in achieving sustainable coastal defence. Using case studies from the Holderness coastline, it (a) reviews the options with respect to erosion control on a rapidly eroding coast, and (b) acknowledges the need to introduce change gradually if it is to be accepted. Specifically, it assesses the potential to use planning permission controls to prevent new development in areas where maintaining a hard defence line will interrupt longshore transport, with potentially significant down-drift effects.

AB One of the key challenges for mankind is to ensure the efficient use of material resources. While there is a general agreement on the need to achieve sustainable development, the strategies by which it can be secured are both disparate and lacking in overall focus. For companies such as BT, however, with its massive purchasing power and ability to influence its suppliers, the path of product stewardship is one that could open up new vistas in the achievement of sustainable development. This article details the important principles behind product stewardship as practised within BT. It also demonstrates that there are economic and social gains to be made as well as environmental ones.

ID CONSERVATION; EXPERIENCE
AB In recent times, the roles of local participation in what was previously perceived as pure public- service delivery has come to the forefront of policy debate and academic research. In this connection, this paper focuses on the roles of local communities in the management of protected ecosystems using the proposed Abuja national park as a case study. Based on the analysis of the results of a socio-economic survey of the communities in the study area, the paper argues that the sustainable conservation of the proposed park can only be achieved if a management scheme that will integrate, empower and involve the local communities in the planning and implementation of the park management programme is put in place. The paper suggests a collaborative strategy such as that of the Go-ordinated Resource Management which has the features of promoting an atmosphere of open communication, ensuring voluntary participation of stakeholders and guaranteeing decisions by consensus rather than those that enforce decisions using legal and political means.

AB The Himalayas are ecologically fragile and economically underdeveloped, with gee-environmental constraints imposing severe limitations on the level of resource productivity. Consequently, subsistence agriculture constitutes the main source of livelihood in the region. The rapid growth of population has brought about extensive land-use changes in the region, mainly through the extension of cultivation and large-scale deforestation. This irrational land transformation process has not only disrupted the ecological balance of the Himalayan watersheds through reduced groundwater recharge, increased run-off and soil erosion, but has also adversely affected the ecology and economy of the adjoining Indo-Gangetic plains by recurrent hoods and decreased irrigation potential.

AB Sustainability of soil-plant systems requires, among other things, good development and function of mycorrhizal symbioses. The effects of P and micronutrient levels on development of an arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus (AMF) and uptake of Zn, Cu, Mn and Fe by maize (Zen mays L.) were studied. A pot experiment with maize either inoculated or not with Glomus intraradices was conducted in a sand:soil (3:1) mix (pH 6.5) in a greenhouse. Our goal was to evaluate the contribution of mycorrhizae to uptake of Cu, Zn, Mn and Fe by maize as influenced by soil P and micronutrient levels. Two levels of P (10 and 40 mg kg 1 soil) and three levels of a micronutrient mixture: 0, 1X and 2X (1X contained, in mg kg(-1) soil, 4.2 Fe, 1.2 Mn, 0.24 Zn, 0.06 Cu, 0.78 B and 0.036 Mo), were applied to pots. There were more extraradical hyphae at the low P level than at the high P level when no micronutrients were added to the soil. Root inoculation with mycorrhiza and application of micronutrients increased shoot biomass. Total Zn content in shoots was higher in mycorrhizal than non-mycorrhizal plants grown in soils with low P and low or no micronutrient addition. Total Cu content in shoots was increased by mycorrhizal colonization when no micronutrients were added. Mycorrhizal plants had lower Mn contents than non-mycorrhizal plants only at the highest soil micronutrient level. AMF increased total shoot Fe content when no micronutrients were added, but decreased shoot Fe when plants were grown at the high level of micronutrient addition. The effects of G. intraradices on Zn, Cu, Mn, and Fe uptake varied with micronutrient and P levels added to soil.

AB Phosphorus (P) is one of the most important nutrients limiting agricultural production worldwide. In acid and alkaline soils, which make up over 70% of the world's arable land, P forms insoluble compounds that are not available for plant use. To reduce P deficiencies and ensure plant productivity, nearly 30 million tons of P fertilizer are applied every year. Up to 80% of the applied P fertilizer is lost because it becomes immobile and unavailable for plant uptake. Therefore, the development of novel plant varieties more efficient in the use of P represents the best alternative to reduce the use of P fertilizers and achieve a more sustainable agriculture. We show here that the ability to use insoluble P compounds can be significantly enhanced by engineering plants to produce more organic acids. Our results show that when compared to the controls, citrate-overproducing plants yield more leaf and fruit biomass when grown under P-limiting conditions and require less P fertilizer to achieve optimal growth.

AB The forests of the Kilum-Ijim area, around Mount Oku in West Cameroon, are the largest remaining patch of montane forest in West Africa, and the highest in altitude. This important habitat harbours endemic species of both animals and plants but is surrounded by a high density of human settlements: c. 300,000 people live within a day's walk of the forest, which covers only 200 sq km. BirdLife International and the Ministry of the Environment and Forestry, Government of Cameroon, are currently operating the Kilum-Ijim Forest Project, with the overall goal of conserving representative areas of the Cameroon montane forest biome in the long-term. The purpose of the project is to ensure that the biodiversity, extent and ecological processes of the Kilum-Ijim Forest are maintained and that the forest is used sustainably by the local communities. The existence of a small Sphagnum community and associated wetland plant species was discovered in 1997 on the summit of Mount Oku, at 2900 m. This site is of extremely high conservation importance because several plant species endemic to the Kilum-Ijim area have been recorded there. In addition, it is the highest Sphagnum bog and the source of the highest stream in West Africa.

AB When we think of the most egregious forms of intolerance directed against minority communities we tend to associate them with particularly despicable regimes, such as Nazi Germany or Soviet Russia, where racism, ideology or some special route to development is often held to blame, or where ultra-nationalism swamps positive tendencies towards democracy and a civil society. In this essay Levene proposes a partial corrective to this view with reference to the supposedly 'good' nation-state derived from the western liberal model. He considers the behaviour of two such states at their inception, Poland and Israel, with regard to two minorities, Jews and Arabs, with the Jews providing linkage between the two state trajectories. Levene charts their respective rejections of bi-national or multinational development, and suggests that the fact that both states today maintain a modicum of tolerance towards their residual Jewish and Arab minorities is more the result of (paradoxical) good luck than of conscious, benevolent design. In conclusion Levene proposes that the very nature of the modern nation-state militates against genuine pluralistic tolerance, a goal that requires a massive structural re-ordering of contemporary society away from global economies to a sustainability of human scale.

AB After 25 years of sales, glyphosate (N-(phosphomomethyl)glycine) is the world's biggest selling and fastest growing agrochemical. Glyphosate has many strengths, particularly its systemicity and ability to control perennial weeds, which have facilitated its role as an essential tool in modern agriculture. Surveys of recent scientific and patent literature point to several key areas of current and future interest in glyphosate and its use. Biotechnology topics have been the most popular, but there is still much interest in the molecule per se, particularly in manufacturing processes. The mode of action and physiology of glyphosate are common subjects. More applied aspects concern the development of formulations with new adjuvants, or mixtures with other herbicides, to enhance performance. An increasing number of papers are reporting on its environmental fate and on agronomic techniques designed to improve the efficiency of application and minimise its environmental impact. Lack of weed resistance is a key feature of glyphosate despite its widespread use. However, differential levels of tolerance between species have led to changes in weed succession. There is a need to develop integrated weed management systems in which glyphosate still plays a key role. Glyphosate is an exceedingly effective herbicide and presents a considerable challenge to the development of new herbicides for sustainable cropping systems and situations in which cost-effective and environmentally considerate weed control is required.

AB A simple (deterministic) population dynamics model is used to examine the level of fishing mortality at which a population is expected to be driven to extinction (F-crash). Values for F-crash are determined for six marine fish species (Cape hake, blue grenadier, blue warehou, school shark, gummy shark, and orange roughy) subject to commercial harvest. The sensitivity of the value of F-crash to changing the selectivity pattern of the fishery and the relationship between the size of the reproductive component of the population and subsequent births to allow for depensatory effects is examined. F-crash is greatest for highly productive species and when the fishery does not target immature animals. The ratio of F-crash to the fishing mortality at which maximum sustainable yield is achieved, F-crash is a decreasing function of the productivity of the population. The possibility of depensation has little impact on F-MSY but can substantially reduce the ratio F-crash/F-MSY. A series of stochastic simulations is conducted to assess the probability of detecting that the extent of fishing exceeds F-crash using the current IUCN A criterion. The results of these simulations are also used to determine the probability that the IUCN A criteria will be triggered when fishing takes place at F-MSY. The results indicate that there are substantial probabilities of incorrectly identifying species being harvested at F-MSY as being threatened during the 'fishing down' phase and also of not identifying species actually at risk of extinction if fishing mortality is not reduced.

AB Policy makers are hoping that the public will assist in the move reward a sustainable transport system by purchasing alternatively fueled vehicles (AFVs), many of which are now available in the UK. But if the public's knowledge-base of transport issues is low, it seems unlikely that consumer behavior will change sufficiently enough to solve the problems associated with high levels of traffic pollution. To assess the extent of popular understanding, an open-ended questionnaire has been used to investigate the perceptions of the British public on issues relating to transport. Topics include the environmental impact of vehicle emissions and the level of awareness of other alternative transport technologies such as natural gas, fuel-cell, and hybrid vehicles. The focus is to identify the most common misconceptions, with a view to improving educational programs designed to encourage the uptake of AFVs.

DE cleaner production; sustainable development; cleaner production center
AB The sustainability of cleaner production programs requires long-term co-operation between governments, both local and at State level, the university and industry. The presented approach to sustaining cleaner production activities in a region consists of three phases: the initiation, the basic capacity level and the sustainability phase. The initiation phase demands initial funds from donors, experts from universities and case studies in industry. The basic capacity level for further popularization and dissemination of cleaner production principles is achieved by establishing and operating a cleaner production center and/or spin-off company. The former operates primarily in a promotional and research environment, while the latter is typical of the business and development environment. Besides establishing long-term co-operation with stakeholders, a local cleaner production program should be started in the sustainability phase and only on the basis of its results can regional programs be set up to ensure the sustaining of cleaner production activities in the region. The first cleaner production project in Slovenia was initiated by the Graz University of Technology and the University of Maribor. The project was supported by the Austrian and Slovene Governments. Later on proposals were made to found a national cleaner production center. UNIDO was willing to support it but the Slovene side did not show interest in time and the project was thus not realized. When the Slovene Government eventually was willing to support it, UNIDO would not be ready to provide the financial means any more. Consequently, the local government and the Faculty of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering joined forces and a new cleaner production project in the textile industry was launched. The project was then expanded to include a consulting company, which resulted in the emerging of a spin-off company now located in the Styrian Technological Park. This spin-off company has already initiated and carried out numerous projects in the fields of cleaner production and rational energy consumption. Alongside the university, consulting companies and industry, it also works in collaboration with international companies. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

DT Article
DE engineering ethics; ethics of technology; moral conflicts; rationality;
   social shaping of technology; technology assessment
AB The role of ethics in technology development has been often questioned, especially in the early days of societal reflection of technology. However, the situation has changed dramatically. Ethical consideration now is generally declared to be indispensable in shaping technology in a socially acceptable and sustainable way. The expectations of ethics are large; often even a kind of "New Ethics" is postulated. In the present paper an over-estimation of the role of ethics for technology development is rejected. It is argued that ethical reflection is, indeed, indispensable in certain problem areas and situation types; but there is, on the other hand, space for technology development free from the requirement for ethical reflection. The absence of a requirement for ethical reflection, however, always has to be considered relative to some "morale provisoire" (provisional morality) as an accepted normative framework within which technology development may occur without explicit ethical reflection. If this framework, however, is doubted or is shown to be insufficient the situation changes completely. Ethical reflection in this case becomes necessary, to consider this normative framework in order to offer modifications or supplements.

DE combination system of water drainage; water supply and eco-environment
   protection; optimal combination; resourcification of mine water
AB The conflict among water drainage, water supply and eco-environment protection is getting more and more serious due to the irrational drainage and exploitation of ground water resources in coal-accumulated basins of North China. Efficient solutions to the conflict are to maintain long-term dynamic balance between input and output of the ground water basins, and to try to improve resourcification of the mine water. All solutions must guarantee the eco-environment quality. This paper presents a new idea of optimum combination of water drainage, water supply and eco-environment protection so as to solve the problem of unstable mine water supply, which is caused by the changeable water drainage for the whole combination system. Both the management of hydraulic techniques and constraints in economy, society, ecology, environment, industrial structural adjustments and sustainable developments have been taken into account. Since the traditional and separate management of different departments of water drainage, water supply and eco-environment protection is broken up, these departments work together to avoid repeated geological survey and specific evaluation calculations so that large amount of national investment can be saved and precise calculation for the whole system can be obtained. In the light of the conflict of water drainage, water supply and eco-environment protection in a typical sector in Jiaozuo coal mine, a case study puts forward an optimum combination scheme, in which a maximum economic benefit objective is constrained by multiple factors. The scheme provides a very important scientific base for finding a sustainable development strategy.

TI LEADER in Germany and the discourse of autonomous regional development
SO SOCIOLOGIA RURALIS
LA English
DT Article
AB The LEADER programme in Germany has built on the ideas and approaches of independent rural initiatives that have crystallized in a rural movement for autonomous regional development, Since the mid-1980s, ideas such as these have found resonance in regional development programmes in some West German federal states. The implementation of LEADER projects in West Germany can be characterized by the institutionalization and neutralization of the approaches of the independent movements. LEADER's catalytic role has not yet taken place to the same extent in East Germany where, after the unification in 1990 a rapid growth of local and regional development projects has been observed. Although LEADER has only adopted these in part, one can still project that official, institutional project sponsorship seems inevitably to undermine the innovative. independent and critical character of these rural development initiatives. The critical factors for the assessment of LEADER projects are the criteria of innovation and participation that play a central role in the community initiative. It can be concluded that the criteria of innovation are insufficient to direct the innovation process in a direction of sustainable rural development.

DE organic farming; milk production; organic dairy farming; sustainable
   production
AB Ruminants are of particular importance to organic farming because they can utilize the humus-increasing animal fodder with legumes that the system requires in order to generate high value animal proteins. The rules governing organic dairy farming are laid down at Various levels. Any organic product must conform with the EU Directive 2092/91 concerning organic farming. At the level of civil law, the basic guidelines of the International Federation of Organic Agricultural Movements (IFOAM) provide the world standard, whilst in Germany, the framework guidelines of the Organic Farming Association (AGOL) provide the minimum standard at the national level. The most detailed regulations can be found in the guidelines of various organizations e.g. Bioland, Demeter. Dairy farming on average achieves compared with conventional production only slightly lower productivity per animal. The commercial marketing takes place through contracts with dairies and farm-based processing units. Efforts in dairy farming are chiefly directed at the implementation of appropriate "green" methods of animal husbandry and feeding. These are also the basis for improvements in animal health, where the aim is to avoid the use of ecologically harmful drugs, in particular antibiotics. Assuming that any future system of farm animal husbandry must be able to show the characteristics of a resource-preserving creation of high quality products, appropriate animal care and meet the demand for its products, then organic dairy farming has a high development potential. In order for this to be realized, organic farming must be carefully developed as a sustainable, environmentally-friendly means of production and the political framework must permit an ecologically-based structural change.

TI Energy use reduction potential of passenger transport in Europe
SO TRANSPORT REVIEWS
LA English
DT Article
AB To contribute to a sustainable society, considerable reduction in energy use and CO2 emissions should be achieved. This paper presents the results of calculations exploring the energy use reduction potential of passenger transport for Western Europe (OECD Europe minus Turkey). For these calculations, three types of options are defined emphasizing technological, infrastructural and behavioural change. By 2050, technological improvements may reduce energy use per passenger-km by similar to 30%. Adding infrastructural options, an energy reduction of > 50% by 2050 can be realised. To achieve further energy reductions, options with a large behavioural impact should also be implemented. This results in an 80% energy reduction potential in the transport sector by 2050. To calculate the reduction potential on OECD Europe level, one should factor in expectations concerning mobility growth. Two mobility development scenarios are used. Both scenarios foresee a net decrease in total energy use of 20% with the introduction of the technological and infrastructural improvement options. Adding options emphasizing behavioural change results in a net reduction potential of similar to 60% by 2050.

ID TRANSPORT; ENERGY
AB This paper considers the main road-traffic parameters that determine air pollution, i.e. the total volume of traffic, road speeds and the composition of the vehicle fleet. Changes in the amounts of pollutants emitted, and the importance of each of the three parameters, have been computed by using a traffic assignment model, which also represents emission factors. The types of policies that may be implemented to reduce the environmental impact of transport are then considered. The study demonstrates, for example, that the impact of a deterioration in traffic conditions is limited in comparison with the effect of forecast increases in traffic and improvements in the environmental performance of vehicles. As a consequence, if cities and urban transport are to achieve sustainable development, urban expansion must take place in a controlled way.

DE soil nutrient dynamics; small-holder agriculture; north-eastern Nigeria
AB The fertility of soil in the tropics is strongly influenced by the secondary soil factors of organic matter (OM), cation exchange capacity (CEC), and pH. Thus, information on the changes in the levels of these soil properties is very vital to agricultural land use planning. This study examined the changes which occur in these soil properties following the establishment of small-holder agricultural practices (SHAP), by comparing soil properties under the SHAP with a similar soil under a natural Savannah woodland (forest reserve). The results revealed that in the 0-10 cm layer of soil under small-holder agriculture, there was a significant decline (P < 0.01) in OM, CEC, and pH (P < 0.05) compared with similar properties in the adjoining Savannah woodland. In the 10-30 cm layer of soil, OM, CEC, and pH also declined significantly (P < 0.05), The results suggested a decline in soil fertility in the cultivated sites. The adoption of soil management techniques to conserve and enhance soil OM and nutrients appears crucial to the longterm productivity of the soil and sustainability of agriculture in the area.

AB The preferred payment mechanism in a community financing scheme for local ivermectin distribution was elicited from randomly selected household heads from three communities in Nigeria using interviewer-administered structured questionnaires. The majority of the respondents in the three communities were prepared to pay for local ivermectin distribution. Additionally, the average amounts the respondents were prepared to pay per person treated ($0.28, $0.30 and $0.38 in Nike, Achi and Toro, respectively) were all more than the $0.20 ceiling recommended by the partners of the African Programme on Onchocerciasis Control (APOC). Thus, the cost-recovery outlook is bright in these communities. However, the preferred payment modality varied. Fee-for-service was the predominant payment modality in the Achi and Nike communities, while the Toro community preferred pre-payment. This study demonstrates that many communities have different payment preferences for endemic disease control efforts. This knowledge will help in developing acceptable and sustainable schemes. The imposition of unacceptable payment mechanisms will lead to an unwillingness to pay.

TI Anaerobic digestion for wastewater treatment in Mexico: State of the

DE anaerobic digestion; wastewater; Mexico; technology; industrial;
   domestic; municipal; biogas use; treated water reuse
AB Due to the nascent wastewater treatment practice in Mexico there is great opportunity to introduce anaerobic digestion as the core of the wastewater treatment processes. Nevertheless, this requires an understanding of all the technical, economical and financial aspects that limit its development. According to the National Water Commission, in 1995 municipal and industrial wastewater were produced at rates of 232 and 168 m(3) s(-1) respectively, but only 20 and 12% of these volumes were treated, often with very low efficiencies. In order to increase the treatment capacity of the country, approximately US$ 4515 million managed by the banks for development are supposed to be available to invest in environmental projects. Other financing mechanisms exist through treasury incentives and penalties. Within this situation, anaerobic digestion has grown although not at the required rate and bigger investments are being made on conventional aerobic and physicochemical technologies. Presently there are in the country 85 anaerobic wastewater treatment plants treating 216,295 m(3) d(-1) with an installed volume of 228,551 m(3). UASB reactors account for 74% of the installed volume and national companies have supplied 76% to the anaerobic market. Proper integration of the anaerobic digestion processes for water recycling and energy recovery has not been achieved and there is a big need to demonstrate economic and ecological sustainability.

SO WATER SA
LA English
DT Article
AB The water balance approach. based on the principles of conservation of mass, is applied to the issue of sustainable groundwater management in South Africa, incorporating the ethos of the National Water Act of 1998, prioritising basic human needs and the needs of aquatic ecosystems over inessential uses. The principle of water balance is described and the benefits (such as prevention of resource misallocation), of applying such an approach to groundwater management, are outlined, with additional practical considerations briefly reviewed. It is hoped that the approach will be tested and refined through application to groundwater case studies.

AB The conciliation of economic growth and social justice has been one of the most significant achievements of twentieth-century welfare states. Yet today it is the object of heated controversy. The 'conciliatory' capacity of the welfare state has been put in serious question, especially in the light of 'globalisation'. In this conclusion we consider first the relative influence of external versus domestic developments in generating welfare policy dilemmas and apparently unavoidable trade-offs between efficiency and equality, growth and redistribution, competitiveness and solidarity. Via an examination of employment, social security and health policy we then seek to identify the scope for new value combinations and institutional arrangements that are both mixed (in respect of their normative aims) and virtuous (able to produce advances on ail fronts). We conclude by considering how this agenda can be advanced in political and institutional terms.

DT Article
AB The competition of main consumers of spruce seeds (insects-conobionts and carpophagous vertebrates) was studied. Their role in producing generative organs in spruce is considered. Main types of adaptation and strategy are analyzed, when the changeable resource is used by animals to support their populations. In spruce forests, phytophagous animals do not negatively affect the natural regeneration except in excess seed production. Fluctuations in seed production determine permanent changes in qualify and reserves of fodder for animals. Such conditions promote the existence of many non-competitive consumers which support the sustainable functioning pf spruce forests.

AB The production of foods for an increasingly informed and selective consumer requires the coordinated activities of the various branches of the food chain in order to provide convenient, wholesome, tasty, safe and affordable foods. Also, the size and complexity of the food sector ensures that no single player can control a single process from seed production, through farming and processing to a final product marketed in a retail outlet. Furthermore, the scientific advances in genome research and their exploitation via biotechnology is leading to a technology driven revolution that will have advantages for the consumer and food industry alike. The segment of food processing aids, namely industrial enzymes which have been enhanced by the use of biotechnology, has proven invaluable in the production of enzymes with greater purity and flexibility while ensuring a sustainable and cheap supply. Such enzymes produced in safe GRAS microorganisms are available today and are being used in the production of foods. A second rapidly evolving segment that is already having an impact on our foods may be found in the new genetically modified crops. While the most notorious examples today were developed by the seed companies for the agro-industry directed at the fanning sector for cost saving production of the main agronomical products like soya and maize, its benefits are also being seen in the reduced use of herbicides and pesticides which will have long term benefits for the environment. Technology-driven advances for the food processing industry and the consumer are being developed and may be divided into two separate sectors that will be presented in greater detail:
   1. The application of genome research and biotechnology to the breeding and development of improved plants. This may be as an aid for the cataloging of industrially important plant varieties, the rapid identification of key quality traits for enhanced classical breeding programs, or the genetic modification of important plants for improved processing properties or health characteristics.
   2. The development of advanced microorganisms for food fermentations with improved flavor production, health or technological characteristics. Both yeasts and bacteria have been developed that fulfill these requirements, but are as yet not used in the production of foods. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Fatten [1998. Ecological Modelling, 108(1-3):97-105] uses propositional logic to explore three properties of sustainability: stability, continuation and longevity. Here, I discuss some of the inconsistencies between the statements in the text and those expressed in propositional logic. In addition, I examine some of the conclusions reached by Fatten in the context of dynamic systems theory. A model of a zero-sum system demonstrates that part stability does not necessarily imply system sustainability as conferred by stability, and that part continuation does not necessarily imply system sustainability as conferred by continuation. The statements of propositional logic are about models of the real world, and herein lies its utility. Propositional logic in principle can help us to identify the formal relationships between sustainability concepts in our models, and to begin to tie together results from both ecology and systems theory by pointing out incongruities between intuition and theory. A formal implementation of sustainability is challenging for two reasons. First, sustainability comprises many properties, not all of which can be applied to every ecosystem at all times and over all scales. Second, the nature of any formal system representation has inherent biases derived from the identification and aggregation of its measures and their organizational structure.

DE sustainable development; island energy systems; greenhouse gas emissions
AB The objective of this paper was to investigate the options for the sustainable development of the Northern Ireland energy supply system, reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Particular factors which must be considered centre around the isolation of the system, the prospect of a new gaspipeline and electrical interconnector to the rest of the U.K., and the re-establishment of an electrical interconnector to the Republic of Ireland. The study has relevance for all similar isolated or island systems, which have particular problems because they tend to be relatively small in size, and their isolation means that inter-connection with their neighbours is either weak or non-existent. Because of this, they have to carry greater spare capacity than would normally be the case, with consequent efficiency and cost penalties. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

DE hazard identification; terrestrial compartment; classification; soil

AB Hazard assessment constitutes an essential tool in order to evaluate the potential effects of chemical substances on organisms and ecosystems. It includes as a first step, hazard identification, which must detect the potential dangers of the substance (i.e. the kind of effects that the substance may produce), and a second step to quantify each danger and to set the expected dose/response relationships. Hazard assessment plays a key role in the regulation of chemical substances, including pollution control and sustainable development. However, the aquatic environment has largely received more attention than terrestrial ecosystems. This paper presents the extrapolation of several basic concepts from the aquatic to the terrestrial compartment, and suggests possibilities for their regulatory use. Two specific proposals are discussed. The first focuses on the scientific basis of the hazard identification-classification criteria included in the EU regulations and their extrapolation to the terrestrial environment. The second focuses on the OECD programme for environmental indicators and the development of a soil pollution pressure indicator to quantify the potential hazards for the soil compartment and its associated terrestrial ecosystem related to the toxic chemicals applied deliberately (i.e. pesticides) or not (i.e. heavy metals in sludge-based fertilisers; industrial spills) to the soil.

AB The principles and concept of sustainable development for agricultural region (SDAR) in China are discussed via the investigation of the development of the Xiao-Qiao-Tou (XQT) village, Zhejiang Province, China and the: analysis of the current agricultural problems in China. We argue that the integration of agriculture and rural development and focuses on dealing with the quantity, quality and living levels of farmers are very important for the China's sustainable development. According to the general principles of SDAR in China and the specific conditions of Tongshan County, Jiangsu Province, China, a prototype OpenEnvi, a spatial decision support system, and a group of models are developed to support decisionmakers for SDAR of Tongshan County. Through the computation of decision support models and result analyses, we obtain the major constraint factors to hindering the sustainable development of Tongshan County, the development of population during 1991-2010, the potential grain output, the relationship between population and land, the status and spatial distribution of environmental quality, the comprehensive development status from 1988 to 1993, and the regionalization of the capacity of sustainable development, that are all beneficial to the planning and policy-making for the sustainable development of Tongshan County.

AB This paper discusses the methodological component of a decision support system being developed for the sustainable forest management at the forest management unit level. A geographic information system-based multi-criteria evaluation technique for measuring sustainability of forest management is under development. It integrates and utilises spatial and temporal data on diverse ecological, economic and social variables, while handling data and decision-rule uncertainty. A decision support approach using the concept of aspiration-based utility functions is proposed for formulating forest land use strategies to improve sustainability. It combines the use of linear programming and geographic information systems. As such, the paper attempts to bridge the gap between considerable research work done on developing the framework for measuring sustainability of forest management and a lack of similar efforts in monitoring and using these indicators as a formal part of the planning system.

SO CURRENT SCIENCE

DT Article
AB Combustion of fossil fuels is one of the main contributors of increase in CO2 concentration in the earth's atmosphere. The current carbon emission from fossil fuel burning and cement manufacturing in India is estimated at about 0.272 Giga tonnes (Gt). This increase in CO2 concentration can be sequestered through massive afforestation programmes. The current rate of afforestration in India is about 2 million hectare (mha) per annum which is sufficient to sustain the growing needs of increasing population, but has only marginal CO2 sequestration potential. According to recent land-use/land cover statistics of India generated by remote-sensing techniques, the areas under non-forest degraded lands and forest degraded lands are currently 93.68 mha and 35.89 mha, respectively, totalling to 129.57 mha. If a conservative managed forest productivity of 5.5 tonnes per hectare per year could be attained on only 40 mha of the available surplus degraded land in India through managed forestry programmes such as short rotation forestry plantation, it is possible to obtain carbon mitigation of about 3.32 Gt in the next 50 years, with an annual reduction of about 0.072 Gt of carbon.

AB To achieve the CO2 reductions deemed necessary to limit the impact of adverse climate change will require real changes in the way we both use and supply energy. Although explicit international and national frameworks are necessary to facilitate reduction strategies, regional implementation and local initiatives are increasingly seen as having an important role to play, both in meeting national CO2 reduction targets and improving the local environment. This paper deals with the supply side of the energy equation for Greater Manchester in the U.K., examining the potential for 'regional' energy supply options to contribute to a reduction in carbon intensity. By assessing actual and latent regional opportunities, the potential for achieving a more sustainable energy supply system is evaluated. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Methane production in Muzaffarnagari sheep was studied using open circuit respiration calorimetry technique. Twelve rams were divided in three treatment groups of four each and were fed at about maintenance with diets having three roughage (oat bay) to concentrate ratio (R : C), i.e. 92 : 8 (group I), 50 : 50 (group II), 30 : 70 (group III). Concentrate mixture was formulated to contain 93% crushed maize grain, 3.5% wheat bran and 3.5% groundnut cake fortified with minerals. Whereas the digestibility of dry matter, organic matter and energy was similar, the digestibility of nitrogen was significantly (p < 0.05) higher in groups II and III and of neutral detergent fiber (NDF) was significantly (p < 0.05) lower in-group III than the other groups. Nitrogen retention was improved but not beyond 50R : 50C. As a percent of gross energy intake, urinary energy losses in groups I, II and III were 3.0, 2.9 and 2.8%, and methane energy losses were 3.39, 3.34 and 2.98%, respectively. Even though, gross energy intakes (kcal/kg W-0.75) were similar, methane loss (g) per 100 g digestible organic matter was significantly (p < 0.05) higher in group I (2.2) than in groups II (1.84) and III (1.54), the latter did not differ in this respect. Metabolisable energy (ME) value (Mcal/kg DM) and energy balances (kcal/kg W-0.75) On rations in groups II and III were similar but on ration in group I was significantly (p < 0.05) lower than that in other groups. Efficiency of utilisation of ME for maintenance (k(m)) of diets in groups I, LI and III calculated as per ARC (1980) were 0.674, 0.688 and 0.693, respectively, and did not differ significantly. Based on the evaluation of three R : C, it was inferred that R : C ratio of 50 : 50 in diet of Muzaffarnagari sheep is optimum for economical and sustainable sheep production through reduced methane emissions.

AB The social organization of the last population of giraffes (Giraffa camelopardalis) in West Africa was studied between October 1996 and December 1997. Population size increased from 51 to 63 individuals during the study period. Groups were larger during the rainy season (mean group size 9.4) than during the dry season (mean group size 6; U = 4131; P < 0.01). Giraffes did not show strong preferential associations. Group types observed were similar to those expected on the assumption that associations are independent of sex and age. Inter-individual associations were low (mean simple ratio value = 0.1), with an individual associating with only half of its partners of the previous day. Young males interacted more frequently than other classes did. Agonistic interactions occurred mostly among males. Contact interactions (i.e. non-agonistic or sexual) occurred between both sexes and most age classes. Links between local communities, domestic animals, fauna and the environment suggest that environment and development cannot be dissociated in the sustainable exploitation of natural resources.

AB A simple dynamic farm model is developed and used to analyse the net worth of a family farm grazing enterprise producing wool on the Northern Tablelands of New South Wales, Australia, under alternative assumptions regarding family expenses and investments in fertilizer. The linkage between family costs and expenditure on fertilizer is explored over a 25-year period highlighting the feed-back effects of each type of expenditure on farm productivity and ultimately on net worth and thus farm viability. Inputs to the model include historic values for rainfall, fertilizer application rates, commodity prices and rates of interest and inflation. In this way, the farm business performance is investigated over a wide range of climatic conditions and commodity prices, typical of the real conditions experienced by grazing enterprises in this region between 1967 and 1992. The results show that non-discretionary fertilizer applications had a large effect on the maintenance of soil fertility compared to discretionary applications (average available phosphorous levels of 29.0 and 9.2 ppm, respectively). This in turn resulted in higher average wool production per head (4.63 and 3.95 kg/hd, respectively) and higher carrying capacity. The final (1992) net worth for a family farm applying discretionary rates of fertilizer varied from $0.13m to -$1.00m for those families raising over 25 years zero or three children, respectively. For families applying fertilizer as a non-discretionary expense, the net worth in 1992 was estimated to be $3.5m and $2.6m for families raising zero or three children, respectively. Both the level of initial debt and the level of fixed costs had considerable effects on final net worth. Higher fertilizer applications also provided a buffering effect on the effects of debt, high fixed costs and the costs of raising children. The results suggest that investments in fertilizer are essential for maintaining farm viability, regardless of the level of expenditure on raising children. The model provides a useful means of integrating the effects of competing expenditures on long-term profitability and net worth of a family farm. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Organizing for sustainable development: Conservation organizations and
   the struggle to protect tropical rain forests in Esmeraldas, Ecuador
SO AMBIO
LA English
DT Article
AB Specialists in tropical rain forest conservation have recently begun to suggest that forests facing imminent destruction in deforestation 'hot spots' can not be saved, and that conservation organizations would use their resources more effectively if they focused on preserving 'cold spots', remote places with intact rain forests. The advocates of the cold spot strategy contend that sustainable development efforts in deforestation 'hot spots' are ineffective. A case study of sustainable development in a rapidly deforesting region of coastal Ecuador questions this contention. Sustainable development in this region takes two organizational forms, one focused on the adoption of sustainable forestry techniques in a small set of villages and the other centered around the creation of a civic arena for discussing and resolving regional sustainable development issues. This two-pronged effort has achieved some success and may provide a model for sustainable development in places experiencing rapid tropical deforestation.

AB Unselected nationwide cohorts of Argentine men 18 years of age summoned for military service were tested for antibodies to Trypanosoma cruzi each year from 1981 to 1993. After an initial screening using indirect hemagglutination test, the positive sera were retested by titrated indirect hemagglutination and immunofluorescence antibody tests at 39 laboratories or at the national reference center in Buenos Aires. Nearly 1.8 million men were examined for T. cruzi antibodies using the same standardized procedures under a quality assurance program. The prevalence of seropositivity for T. cruzi decreased significantly from 5.8% in 1981 to 1.9% in 1993, but the decrease was not homogeneous among provinces within each region or constant over time. Prior to the nationwide control campaign initiated in 1961-1962, 15 provinces had high (> 20%) percentages of houses with domiciliary infestation by Triatoma infestans bugs, which decreased to nine provinces in 1982, and four provinces in 1992. The observed decrease in the prevalence of seropositivity far T. cruzi may be mostly attributed to the spraying with insecticides to eliminate the domiciliary populations of Triatoma infestans. The lack of a sustainable triatomine surveillance program set a limit to the decrease of seropositivity rates and prompted a revised strategy based on community participation.

AB In less intensive shrimp culture systems, polychaetes are known to be a major food item of several penaeid species. Under these conditions, very little is known about their population dynamics and the possible interactions with penaeid predation and artificial feeding. This work examined the effects of Penaeus subtilis, predation, stocking density and supplemental feeding on the population dynamics of polychaetes in pond enclosures. The work was conducted in a shrimp pond, where forty-five 9-m(2) open-bottom enclosures were built. The study consisted of four treatments: enclosures with feed and shrimp (i.e., FS); enclosures without feed and shrimp (NFNS, control); enclosures with shrimp and no feed (NFS); and, enclosures with feed, but no shrimp (FNS). For enclosures with shrimp, four initial shrimp stocking densities were used (i.e., 5, 10, 15 and 20 shrimp/m(2)). Benthic polychaetes were collected 2 days prior to shrimp stocking and were sampled every 10 days over the complete rearing cycle. A total of 1,631 substrate samples of 20.33 cm(2) containing 20,283 polychaetes were collected for analysis. Overall, polychaete density and dry biomass over the production cycle varied from 956 to 11,921 polychaetes/m(2) and 1.17 to 2.58 g/m(2), respectively. Six polychaete families were identified and ranked relative to their numerical occurrence and frequency (Cn) as follows: (I) Spionidae (Cn = 52.3%), (2) Capitellidae (Cn = 37.9%), (3) Eunicidae (Cn = 6.8%), and (4) Nereidae (Cn = 2.7%), Pilargidae (Cn = 0.3%) and Sabellidae (Cn < 0.1%). P. subtilis final body weight varied from a minimum of 4.2 g to a maximum of 9.3 g, with final survival ranging from 42 to 69%. Shrimp predatory pressure produced a reduced polychaete growth in NFS and FS enclosures when compared to other treatments. Polychaete numerical abundance and biomass were greatly affected by higher shrimp stocking densities, while their population patterns appeared to be governed by other environmental and endogenous cues. Artificial feeding promoted higher polychaete levels even when shrimp were present, but it was not effective in alleviating P. subtilis grazing pressure at increased stocking densities (i.e., 15 and 20 shrimp/m(2)). Results showed that P, subtilis predation, shrimp stockings density and external food supply are major factors to be considered when establishing sustainable limits for polychaete use as a naturally occurring food source in aquaculture systems.

ID FISHERIES
AB The potential yields of demersal reefal and lagoonal finfish, which are valuable for trade or consumption in the Northern Province of New Caledonia, are unknown. Fishing pressure was estimated from tally-sheets of professional fishermen to assess trade fishing and a household consumption survey to assess subsistence fishing. Total yield was estimated to be 1 326 tonnes in 1995, 94 % of which correspond to subsistence fishing. Most of the catches were taken from the east and west coasts; in the north zone (Belep Archipelago) catches were very low. From this fishing pressure and the total stock values, the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) was estimated to be 12 600 t, which was about 10 % of the total stocks assessed in the Northern Province (138 300 t). This MSY was dominated by five families, namely Lethrinidae, Acanthuridae, Scaridae, Serranidae and Lutjanidae. The results suggest that fishing effort in the Northern Province of New Caledonia could increase without endangering the stock. However, on a smaller geographical scale, some locations (Kone and Nepoui on the west coast), reef habitats (near-reef areas) or species groups (fish caught by line) were already being intensively fished. Fishing techniques should be diversified so that part of the fishing effort be redirected toward the least heavily exploited groups of species and biotopes.

AB In the 1960s, 27 muskoxen (Ovibos moschatus) were introduced to Angujaartorfiup Nunaa, which is located next to Kangerlussuaq Airport in West Greenland. Data from 12 aerial surveys of muskoxen from 1986 to 1996 show 1) that: the population has stabilized at 3000 muskoxen since hunting was initiated in 1988, 2) that the population has maintained a high level of reproduction during the study period, and 3) that an annual kill of about 700 muskoxen will maintain the population at its current revel if natural mortality and reproduction remain unchanged. Using a geographical information system to subdivide data by topography and altitude showed that muskoxen greatly favour valleys and lowland areas. Densities of muskoxen above 500 m above sea level were less than 51% of densities below 500 m above sea level.

AB The islands Ovalau and Moturiki in central Fiji are selected for the investigation of coastal change over the past c.200 years. Although having coastal environments typical of many tropical Pacific Islands, Ovalau and Moturiki are also atypical because they experienced urban and infrastructural developments before most other parts. The associated records enable recent coastal changes to be discerned more clearly here than has been possible elsewhere. The islands are surrounded by coral reef, the configuration of which accounts for variations in vulnerability of their coasts to erosion, interviews were conducted in each of 22 settlements along the islands' coasts and information obtained about recent coastal change. Mangroves are concentrated along leeward coasts, although they have been cleared Jj om many windward coasts in the last 40+years, causing shoreline erosion to be initiated/accelerated. Most shoreline-protection initiatives (vegetation planting and seawall construction) have failed. Three major management implications of the study are discussed. Firstly, there is a need to redefine the nature of the interactions between coastal inhabitants and coastal ecosystems, so that environments are sustainably developed; and specifically that reefs are conserved and shoreline vegetarian (especially mangroves) is effectively replanted. Secondly, information about appropriate design and composition of artificial structures for shoreline protection needs to be made available to the local communities who construct most of them. Thirdly, alternative sources of sand and rock aggregate to those whose extraction aggravates shoreline erosion should be sought.

   transferable quotas in Australia's South East Fishery
SO AUSTRALIAN GEOGRAPHER
LA English
DT Article
DE individual transferable quotas; South East Fishery; Eden; sustainable
   fishery management; economic restructuring of the trawling industry
AB In 1988, responding to international legislation that requires sustainable fishery management, the Australian Fishery Management Authority (AFMA) implemented an individual transferable quota (ITQ) management system to address the environmental crisis in the South East Fishery. Defining sustainability in its broadest context to include social as well as economic and ecological dimensions, this paper firstly describes the environmental crisis and the South East Fishery's ITQ management system. Secondly, Christy's (1973) paper is employed as a catalyst to compare the theoretical socio-economic outcomes with the actual operation of ITQs. The brief South East Fishery experience suggests that the logic behind ITQs is correct. Production has become reorganised. Operators are not only fewer, but also embrace professionalism, quality, efficiency, and the operation of the free market within the industry. However, because of the local idiosyncrasies of this multi-species fishery, the legislation over territorial waters, and the absence of alternative employment, fishers have adopted non-quota fishing techniques and entered seas under New South Wales jurisdiction. Without a social re-adjustment policy or buy-out scheme, the AFMA's objective of ecologically sustainable development cannot be attained.

AB Among the most popular media images of Australia are the outback heroes: the explorer, pioneer and pastoralist. However, there is insufficient attention paid to the role that pastoralists and their management strategies have played in the dispossession and degradation of arid Australia. A historical overview of ecology and land management suggests that the fragility of Australia's arid ecosystems was identified over 100 years ago, and despite repeated calls for reform, effective regional management schemes are still vehemently opposed by pastoralists. I argue that, until the role played by pastoralists and their management strategies in the degradation of arid Australia has been adequately communicated, pastoralists will remain a powerful political lobby capable of thwarting the implementation of sustainable land management practises.

TI A test for correct species declaration of frog legs imports from
   Indonesia into the European Union
SO BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION

DE allozymes; frog legs; Indonesia; Ranidae; trade control
ID IDENTIFICATION
AB Frozen frog legs that had been shipped from Indonesia into the European Union were biochemically compared to reference muscle samples from wild Indonesian frog populations of different species. Frozen frog leg samples only allowed for the analysis of eight allozyme loci, two of which were polymorphic. The analyses clearly showed that all frog legs, despite their initial species declaration as Limnonectes macrodon, L. cancrivorus, L. limnocharis and Rana catesbeiana, all belonged to L. cancrivorus. Unless misclassification was intentional, it seems that Indonesian frog leg exporters are not able to discriminate between the species in trade. However, this ability should be the basis for a sustainable use of this wildlife resource. A test for management authorities is needed to monitor the international trade in frog legs.

AB China is one of the 'megadiversity' countries of the world, and is therefore rich in biodiversity information. The decision making on biodiversity conservation and sustainable utilization demands sufficient, accurate, data and information which covers living things as well as natural background and human activities. It is estimated that 152 biodiversity databases have been developed in China, mainly distributed in the thematic information categories of forestry, nature reserve, forest ecosystem, animal, plant, crop germplasm resource, traditional Chinese medicine, water resource, geology/geography, and climate/meteorology, etc. The status quo of biodiversity information system was also reviewed and main information networks related to biodiversity were presented. There are problems in the CHM construction in China, such as insufficient funding, unreasonable organizational mechanism, and low-level information sharing. Future needs for the CHM construction were discussed.

ID STABILIZATION PONDS; PERFORMANCE; REMOVAL
AB For sustainable wastewater management in developing countries, the implementation of low-cost, simple treatment systems should be encouraged. In this study, the performance of three treatment schemes was evaluated. The first step in all schemes was upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB). The post treatment was either Algal Pond (AP). Lemna Pond (LP) or Rotating Biological Contactor (RBC). The results show that the performance of the UASB was satisfactory. Mean COD and BOD removal values were 78% and 85% respectively. The combination of UASB with an AP achieved significant improvement in the microbiological quality of the effluent. The geometric mean of fecal coliform in the effluent was 1.3 x 10(3) MPN/100ml. Residual COD was 143 mg O-2/L. This relatively high value was due to the presence of algae in the AP effluent. The use of the LP as a post treatment achieved better quality effluent. As indicated by the physico-chemical characteristics. However, fecal coliform removal was less by one log as compared to the AP effluent. When the RBC was used as a second stage. COD and BOD removal rates were 47% and 66% respectively. Also complete nitrification took place. Fecal coliform density declined by 5 logs.

AB Decomposition in landfills is erratic and influenced primarily by moisture, inoculum, oxygen and accumulation of inhibitory fermentation products. These parameters may be optimized for decomposition by use of controlled landfill cells or bioreactors. This work evaluated the effect of combined-phase and two-phase anaerobic digestion of municipal solid waste (MSW) in laboratory leachbed (LB) cells. Phase separation resulted in increased rates of decomposition and greater process stability. Leachate recycle with an upflow sludge anaerobic reactor resulted in improvement of performance in a LB reactor which was attributed to removal of inhibitory fermentation products and buffering of acids in the leachate. The effects of aeration and leachate flooding of the LB were also studied. Intermittent aeration of the LB enhanced phase separation but inhibition of methanogenesis was not sustainable beyond six days. Conversion of organic matter was similar in the anaerobic and aerated LBs. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Resource-based theory has tended to focus on the development and protection of valuable resources. What determines a valuable resource has received less attention. This paper addresses three related issues concerning value and valuable resources: what is value? how is it created? and who captures it? We have tried here to integrate different strands of the literature to address these questions. First, we argue that a distinction needs to be made between use value, which is subjectively assessed by customers, and exchange value, which is only realized at the point of sale. Second, we argue that the source of new use values is the labour performed by organizational members, and that firm profits can be attributed to this labour. Profit differences between competing firms derive from labour performing heterogeneously across firms. Finally, we argue that value capture is determined by the perceived power relationships between buyers and sellers.

TI Role of satiation in the functional response of a piscivore, largemouth
   bass (Micropterus salmoides)
SO CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES

   GROWTH; RATES; PRODUCTIVITY; PERTURBATION; TEMPERATURE
AB We evaluated whether satiation regulates the predation rates of a piscivore, largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides), in natural settings. A functional response model indicated that predation rates can be reduced by satiation when mean prey density is high or when prey encounters are highly patchy. We then used bioenergetics modeling to estimate the predation rates of individual bass in four lakes during a 16-year period and used stomach content mass in diet samples to evaluate the variability in daily predation rates. Predation rates, expressed as the proportion (p) of the maximum daily consumption rate, were low (mode = 0.3, mean = 0.4). Stomach fullness (s), expressed as the proportion of the stomach fullness associated with the maximum sustainable consumption rate, was highly variable, and 13% of all bass diets had s > 1, indicating that bass could opportunistically forage at rates exceeding their maximum sustainable rate. The low predation rates and the ability to consume prey at rates exceeding the maximum sustainable rate make it unlikely that satiation was an important constraint on bass predation rates. Thus, satiation effects widely represented in modeling studies may be a rare component in piscivore-prey interactions, while prey behavior may be a more important component governing predation rates.

In 1992, the share of high-tech products in Malaysian manufacturing exceeded that of Japan, Korea or Taiwan. However, this 'maturity' was acquired without a strong research base. This article provides a framework which looks at the role of research and development (R&D) in conferring technological maturity and assesses the progress Malaysian manufacturing has made in this regard. The authors find that while multinationals have transferred many aspects of production, they have been slow in transferring R&D expertise. Neither has indigenous innovation filled this gap. Consequently, the longterm sustainability of the industrial transformation process in Malaysia is in jeopardy. The article concludes with suggestions for corrective policies.

AB As healthcare providers continually strive to improve quality and increase cost efficiency: patients (and payors) still require and deserve convenience and extensive personal health-related information. The nephrology community, in particular. is facing numerous challenges. The end-stage renal disease (ESRD) population is increasing, er en as is is becoming more complicated The advancing age in the general population is being mirrored in the ESRD population, with 45% of the patients being over the age of 65 Patients with diabetes represent 39% of the ESRD patients, and at a 10% annualized rate of change, diabetes represents one of the fastest-growing causes of ESRD. Not unexpectedly, the costs of caring for these patients have increased. Considering that the ESRD program represents 0.8% of Medicare beneficiaries while consuming 5.5% of the revenues, if is unlikely that ESRD expenditures will continue to elude legislators. To reduce overall healthcare expenditures and improve the quality of care, the process by which cure is delivered needs to be examined and redesigned. Previous attempts to improve quality through externally, imposed targets and a quality assurance (QA) approach have generally been unsuccessful. In contrast by employing continuous quality improvement (CQI) techniques, sustainable changes in the process of care can result in cost-efficient, high-quality cure. The purpose of this study was to assess the ability of internal benchmarking and quality targets when used in conjunction with CQI techniques to correct common causes of poor quality in the dialysis setting.

AB The increase in global energy consumption urges the exploitation of known energy resources in the most efficient way. The oil and gas industry seems well capable, but politics may hamper optimum recovery, even though politicians advocate that the laws and regulations laid upon the industry are meant to promote a sustainable society and to diminish environmental pollution. Lack of geological insight sometimes plays a role, which implies that an attitude of effectively wringing out the earth is not sufficient: more attention for earth-scientific education may turn out to be even more important. This does not affect, however, the need for ever more effective technologies for wringing out the Earth. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The effect of economic growth on pollution emissions differs substantially among high-income countries. I address this issue by analyzing public environmental policy decisions. Individual heterogeneity, relative income effect and the political framework in which policy decisions are taken determine the emergence of the downward sloping segment of the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC). Income inequality produces a gap between the country's ability to pay for environmental protection and a country's willingness to pay. I test this result by using OECD data on public R&D expenditure for environmental protection. The conclusion is that contrary to the EK hypothesis, moments of the income distribution function other than the mean may be important for the emergence of a virtuous path of sustainable growth in high-income countries.

AB Sustainable development is a normative concept which involves trade-offs among social, ecological and economic objectives, and is required to sustain the integrity of the overall system. This is usefully formalized in terms of a social welfare function which is based on an aggregate of individual preferences and, as a prerequisite of intergenerational equity and overall system integrity, on a set of sustainability constraints. A 'sustainability-based social value function' is proposed to integrate these issues, and to go beyond traditional conceptions of sustainability that are either based on a value principle of maintaining some aggregate of capital ('weak sustainability'), or stationary-state criteria of maintaining social, ecological and economic assets constant over time ('strong sustainability'). Along with individual preferences and macroeconomic objectives, the proposed welfare function integrates principles of basic human needs ('critical economic capital'), integrity of the ecosystem ('critical ecological capital') and the socio-cultural system ('critical social capital'). This implies restrictions of the social opportunity space within which sustainable develop ment can proceed and the new value function is defined. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Conflicts between local people and protected area managers are a common problem in developing countries, but in many cases there has been little attempt to comprehensively characterize the underlying problems. Resource uses, management practices, economy and people's perceptions of problems and likely solutions were analysed in two villages near and two villages away from the core zone of Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve in the Indian Himalaya. Agriculture, although practised on less than 1% of the area, was the primary occupation of local people. Six annual crops of a total of 22 and all four horticultural crops on private farms were damaged by wildlife, but Reserve management provided compensation only for livestock killing by wildlife and compensation amounted to only 4-10% of the total assessed monetary value of killed livestock. A variety of wild plant products were used locally but 27 were marketed by more than 50% of surveyed families; income from wild products was substantially lower than that from crops and livestock. A sociocultural change from a subsistence to a market economy, together with changes in traditional land/resource rights and institutions, has led to a number of changes in land-use and management practices. The livestock population has declined, agricultural area has remained the same and people have started cultivating medicinal species in the last 20 years. These changes seem complementary to the goal of conservation. However, changes such as abandonment of some traditional food crops and stress on cash crops lacking fodder value, requiring substantial manure inputs derived from forest litter and livestock excreta, and causing severe soil erosion, seem to counter the goal of environmental conservation. Some government-managed Reserve Forest sites were similar to the Community Forests in terms of species richness, basal area and soil physico-chemical properties. Two Reserve Forest sites showed basal areas of 160.5-191.5 m(2)/ha, exceeding the highest values reported so far from the region. The formal institutional framework of resource management seems to be not as effective as the traditional informal system. The Reserve Management Plan lays more emphasis on legal protection than on the sustainable livelihood of local communities and has led to conflicts between local people and reserve managers. Plantation of fodder and medicinal species in degraded forest lands, suppression of economic exploitation of local people in the market, enhancement of local knowledge of the economic potential of biodiversity, incentives for cultivation of crops with comparative advantages and lesser risks of damage by wildlife, and rejuvenation of the traditional involvement of the whole village community in decison-making, could be the options for resolving conflicts between people and protected areas in this case.

AB In the eighteenth century, the economic problem was reformulated according to a particular set of politico-economic components, in which the pursuit of individual freedom was elevated to an ethical and political ideal. Subsequent developments of this individualist philosophy together with the achievements of technological progress now appear as a threat to future existence. Extensive environmental degradation and persistent global inequalities of wealth demand a new reformulation of the economic problem. Sustainable development has emerged as the most recent economic strategy for addressing concerns about ecological integrity and social justice. Although there is a recognized continuum of understanding about the concept-from conservative to radical-it has been argued that only the radical version of sustainable development embodies the ethical capacity to address these concerns. Simultaneously the perennial existential question "How should we live?" has been raised anew along with the novel ethico-moral question: "How should we arrange our systems of production and consumption to ensure the sustainability of the Earth under conditions of conspicuous and pressing environmentally limiting conditions?" Moreover, the strong normative dimension embodied in the radical version of sustainability represents a challenge to liberal democracy and its understanding of individual and collective goods. I argue that the radical approach has the capacity to relieve what is an inherently acute tension of modern life and to reconcile individual autonomy with the wider social and ecological good.

ID CATCHMENT MANAGEMENT; IMPLEMENTATION
AB Implementing the concept of sustainability through integrated approaches to natural resource management poses enormous challenges for both the rural communities and government agencies concerned. This paper reviews the underlying rhetoric of sustainable agricultural systems and the integrated resource management paradigm and identifies some of the challenges being experienced in translating this rhetoric into practice. A relatively recently implemented community-based integrated catchment management (ICM) process in a rural community in northeast Australia is examined in terms of some of the lessons learned that may be relevant to other similar integrated resource management (IRM) processes. It reveals a pragmatic, opportunistic, and evolving implementation process based on adaptive learning rather than a more traditional "rational" planning approach. Some essential characteristics of a community-based IRM process are identified, including fostering communication; providing a structure that fosters cooperation and facilities coordination among community, industry, and government agencies; the integration of IRM principles into local government planning schemes; and an emergent strategic approach to IRM program implementation. We conclude by identifying some essential characteristics of an IRM process that can assist a community to adapt to, and manage change for, sustainable resource use.

ID BIOSPHERE
AB If current trends continue, human activities will drastically alter most of the planet's remaining natural ecosystems and their composite biota within a few decades. Compounding the impacts on biodiversity from deleterious management practices is climate variability and change. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) recently concluded that there is ample evidence to suggest climate change is likely to result in significant impacts on biological diversity. These impacts are likely to be exacerbated by the secondary effects of climate change such as changes in the occurrence of wildfire, insect outbreaks and similar disturbances. Current changes in climate are very different from those of the past due to their rate and magnitude, the direct effects of increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations and because highly modified landscapes and an array of threatening processes limit the ability of terrestrial ecosystems and species to respond to changed conditions. One of the primary human adaptation option for conserving biodiversity is considered to be changes in management. The complex and overarching nature of climate change issues emphasises the need for greatly enhanced cooperation between scientists, policy makers, industry and the community to better understand key interaction's and identify options for adaptation. A key challenge is to identify opportunities that facilitate sustainable development by making use of existing technologies and developing policies that enhance the resilience of climate-sensitive sectors. Measures to enhance the resilience of biodiversity must be considered in all of these activities if many ecosystem services essential to humanity are to be sustained. New institutional arrangements appear necessary at the regional and national level to ensure that policy initiatives and research directed at assessing and mitigating the vulnerability of biodiversity to climate change are complementary and undertaken strategically and cost-effectively. Policy implementation at the national level to meet responsibilities arising from the UNFCCC (e.g., the Kyoto Protocol) and the UN Convention on Biological Diversity require greater coordination and integration between economic sectors, since many primary drivers of biodiversity loss and vulnerability are influenced at this level. A case study from the Australian continent is used to illustrate several key issues and discuss a basis for reform, including recommendations for facilitating adaptation to climate variability and change.

AB Two decades of developing relevant legal and institutional regimes for the sustainable and nondestructive use of natural resources have framed Costa Rica's pioneer approach to mitigate climate change and conserve its rich biological diversity. This policy framework provides an appropriate context for the actual and proposed development of market instruments designed to attract capital investments for carbon sequestration and biodiversity conservation, and allows the establishment of mechanisms to use those funds to compensate owners for the environmental services provided by their land. As a developing economy, Costa Rica is striving to internalize the benefits from the environmental services it offers, as a cornerstone of its sustainable development strategy.

TI Valuing fisheries depreciation in natural resource accounting: The
   pelagic fisheries in northeast Peninsular Malaysia
SO ENVIRONMENTAL & RESOURCE ECONOMICS
LA English
DT Article
DE depreciation; fisheries resource accounting; optimal catch; pelagic
   fishery; present value
ID ECONOMIC DEPRECIATION
AB In this paper, an approach based on the net present value method is used to account for the changes in the value of fisheries resources. Changes in the value of fisheries resources can occur between successive years' catch as well as between current and optimal levels of catch. These changes need to be accounted for in the national accounting system to reflect the 'true' net national income that is sustainable. The approach outlined in this paper is desirable as it allows the estimation of the depreciation value of fisheries resource with limited biological information. The application of the approach to the pelagic fisheries in Northeast Peninsular Malaysia (NEPM) showed that the resource depreciated in value over most years from 1982 to 1993. These depreciations correspond to increased fishing effort. In addition, pelagic catches in NEPM from 1982 to 1993 were lower than the optimal levels of catch due to overfishing. Thus policies aimed at reducing fishing effort can provide improvement in both the potentially higher capital values of the fishery resource and the earning potentials of the fishing industry in NEPM.

TI Resource accounting in measures of unsustainability: Challenging the
   World Bank's conclusions
SO ENVIRONMENTAL & RESOURCE ECONOMICS

   pollution; sustainability; World Bank
ID NET NATIONAL PRODUCT; GREEN
AB The World Bank has recently published a comprehensive study of environmental and resource accounting, covering 103 countries (World Bank 1997a). The study concludes that many Sub-Saharan, Northern African and Middle East countries have had negative 'genuine' saving rates over the last 20 years and therefore fail to pass the test of weak sustainability. This paper argues that the Bank's conclusions depend on a method for computing user costs from resource exploitation that is challenged by two competing ones (the 'El Serafy'-method and the method of Repetto et al.) and is inferior to one of its rivals. Resource rents are re-computed using the 'El Serafy'-method for 14 countries and the Sub-Saharan and Northern African and Middle East regions. The results are that both regions and almost all countries either stop exhibiting signs of unsustainability or their unsustainability can be explained without having recourse to resource accounting. However, for Congo, Ecuador, Gabon, Nigeria, Mauritania and Trinidad and Tobago there is a lesson: These countries did not adequately use the opportunities they were given through their natural resource endowments and should learn from their mistake for the future depletion of their remaining reserves of natural resources.

ID STRESS; SUSTAINABILITY; MANAGEMENT
AB Ecosystem Health takes the health concept to a new dimension. Traditionally the concept of health has been restricted to individuals and populations. However, it has become apparent that ecosystems also can become dysfunctional, particularly under stress from human activity The International Society for Ecosystem Health has provided a forum for the evolution of methods of assessing ecosystem health, and for applications to environmental management. This emerging field requires collaboration from many areas, including importantly, the earth sciences. In this paper we articulate the concept of ecosystem health, review the history of the International Society and illustrate the role of the earth sciences in ecosystem rehabilitation with a case study from Ostrobothnia, western Finland. Several of the rivers in the region suffer from acidification due to drainage and other alteration of sulphide rich soils. The study illustrates how limited areas with special geochemical characteristics can dominate the health of large systems.

AB Aims: To develop a system to improve and monitor clinical performance in the management of breast cancer patients in one United Kingdom health region.
   Design: An observational study of the changes brought about bl: the introduction of new structures to influence clinical practice and monitor change.
   Setting: North Thames (East) Health region, comprising seven purchasing health authorities and 21 acute hospitals treating breast cancer.
   Subjects: The multi-disciplinary breast teams in 21 hospitals and an audit sample of 419 (28%) of the breast cancer patients diagnosed in 1992 in the region.
   Interventions: Evidence-based interventions for changing clinical practice: regional guidelines, senior clinicians acting as 'opinion leaders', audit of quality rather than cost of services, ownership of data by clinicians, confidential feedback to participants and education.
   Outcome measures: Qualitative measures of organizational and behavioural change. Quantitative measures of clinical outcomes compared to guideline targets and to results from previous studies within this population.
   Results: Organizational changes included the involvement, participation of and feedback to 16 specialist surgeons and their multidisciplinary teams in 21 hospitals. Regional clinical guidelines were developed in 6 months and the dataset piloted within 9 months. The audit cycle was completed within 2 years. The pilot study led to prospective audit at the end of 2 years for all breast cancers in the region and a 15-fold increase in high quality clinical information for these patients.
   Changes in clinical practice between 1990 and 1992 were observed in the use of chemotherapy (up from 17-23%) and axillary surgery (up from 46-76%).
   Conclusions: The approach used facilitated rapid change and found a balance between local involvement (essential for sustainability within a hospital setting) and regional standardization (essential for comparability across hospitals). The principles of the approach are generalized to other cancers and to other parts of the UK and abroad.

AB Promiscuously nodulating varieties of soyabean have been developed which nodulate abundantly and effectively in most soils in southern Africa. Bred from genotypes collected in East Asia these promiscuous varieties nodulate with fast and slow-growing rhizobia representing several different genera, The symbiotic interaction between different soyabean genotypes and different rhizobial isolates varies widely both in terms of ability to nodulate and effectiveness in N-2 fixation, but all plant genotypes tested, including varieties considered to be highly specific, nodulated with indigenous isolates in at least one soil.
   Promiscuity in nodulation allows soyabean to be introduced into a range of environments where lack of suitable inoculants would otherwise preclude growing the crop. Smallholder farmers need only access to seed to be able to grow soyabean, which brings multiple benefits in improved household nutrition from the high protein and oil content, cash income from sales of the crop and inputs of N which enhance soil fertility and contribute to the sustainability of their cropping system. Promiscuous soyabean varieties therefore represent a highly appropriate technology for cultivation of soyabeans for smallholder farmers, whereas use of varieties with greater yield potential together with rhizobial inoculants is an appropriate technology for commercial production of soyabeans by farmers who have ready access to agricultural inputs.

TI Reconciling sustainability, economic efficiency and equity in fisheries:
   the one that got away?
SO FISH AND FISHERIES
LA English
DT Article
DE decision-making; fisheries management; institutions; sustainability;
   uncertainty
AB Concern about the global state of fisheries and fish resources has highlighted the three primary considerations in fisheries management: sustainable utilisation, economic efficiency and equity in access to resources. We appear to be failing in pursuit of all three goals. Living marine resources are particularly threatened by overfishing, leading to many of the world's fish stocks being heavily, fully or over exploited. Similarly, the economic diagnosis is that costs of fishing exceeded the value of the world's catch by about US$ 40 billion at the beginning of the decade. Statistics on equity are less available, but the necessary spread of limited access to fisheries frequently has the greatest impact on the small scale, traditional fisher.
   This paper considers the reasons underlying the general failure of fisheries management and the solutions that are being proposed. Factors contributing to the problems include high biological uncertainty, conflict between the constraint of sustainability and social and economic priorities, poorly defined objectives, and institutional failures related to access rights and participation in management by the users. These issues point to the real complexity of fisheries management. It is argued that this complexity can be abused by all interest groups to avoid responsibility and to suit their own objectives. It is suggested that there are eight simple principles controlling fisheries management that are generally well-understood and, if properly considered in fisheries management systems, would lead to improved performances.
   Responsible management will, however, only be effective if there is a genuine desire to achieve the objectives. Fishing capacity, frequently reflecting dependency of users on fisheries resources, is commonly in excess of the sustainable production of the resources. Excess dependency can preclude the political will to consider alternative strategies and only once it has been overcome, probably requiring solutions borrowed from outside fisheries, is effective management likely to be considered seriously. Thereafter, responsible management requires setting unambiguous objectives and management measures in co-operation with users and other interest groups. The agreed strategy must be included in legislation to ensure transparency and accountability and to constrain decision-makers. The performance of the strategy must be monitored and revised as necessary.

AB To test whether Brazil nut (Bertholletia excelsa) requires a specific canopy gap size in order to regenerate, 50 gaps of varying size (25-712 m(2)) and 20 understorey sites (each of 141 m(2)) were sampled in tropical moist forest at Riberalta, Bolivia. The density of Brazil nut seedlings (<1.30 m in height) and saplings (>1.30 m) was assessed at each site, and the light environment was determined using hemispherical photography to estimate the global site factor (GSF), which represents the proportion of total above canopy irradiance that is received below the canopy. Saplings only occurred in gaps >95 m(2) or >10.48 GSF, whereas seedlings occurred throughout a range of gap sizes and in the forest understorey. Regression analysis showed a highly significant relationship between Brazil nut sapling density against both gap size and global site factor (GSF). These results may contribute to the development of plans for sustainable management of this species, by defining the appropriate canopy gap size required for the successful natural regeneration of Brazil nut.

ID PRODUCTS CERTIFICATION; MANUFACTURERS
AB Certification of forest management practices and manufactured wood products can potentially involve many stakeholders. One group that has the potential to influence certification in the United States is public forest-related agency managers. In this study, certification was researched from the perspectives of forest managers in the two largest federal public land management agencies (USDA Forest Service and U.S. Bureau of Land Management) and state foresters. Respondents believed there is more of a need for certification of tropical forests than for U.S. forests. In addition, they believed that state and federal timberlands are in the least need of certification relative to privately held timberland. Although respondents understand the concept of certification, they have a low degree of trust in environmental claims made by wood products manufacturers. Finally respondents generally do not believe that consumers will pay a premium for certified wood products nor that the public will support certification as a mechanism to ensure forest sustainability.

AB This paper is a report on the analysis underpinning research exploring the relationship between small firms and sustainability using foresighting methods. It identifies the main barriers preventing small firms from responding to the challenge of sustainability. The potential synergy between foresighting and small firms is outlined and a discussion of the Literature linking foresighting methods and sustainability is presented. Sustainability is also compared with foresighting methods in order to identify complementary characteristics and the methodological underpinnings of foresighting is distinguished from different potential uses and interpretation of the methods. Finally, the paper assesses the utility of foresighting methods in the context of research on small firms and sustainability. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Late-blooming societies can be stimulated by information technology
SO FUTURES
LA English
DT Article
AB About 50 societies in the world have been unable to make significant progress toward development over the last several decades, despite various kinds of assistance. Information technology is a powerful new tool that has not yet been applied. It can strongly reinforce and redirect more familiar programs, and expedite others, such as education, micro-enterprise formation, community-oriented non-government organizations, family size limitation, social communications, financial management and stabilization of politics.
   Introducing much more information makes possible efficient consumption. A good, sustainable quality of life, with minimal consumption of natural resources, seems to be a superior goal for development. Here it is proposed that the target conditions should be 'happiness', ranging from serenity (achieving order, internal calm to delight) to spontaneous, infectious forms (well-being, fun and joy). Sociologists have developed quite robust measures over the last several decades. Happiness comes cheaply, because it need not involve massive infrastructure, fuel or other expensive inputs. Accelerated progress will require some new institutions using information appropriately.
   The outlook for funding from foundations created by the information technology billionaire entrepreneurs is promising after current risks of loss have diminished. The same technology would enable affluent people to adopt lives of voluntary simplicity.
   Consumption at a quarter of Euro-American levels requires only a little planning, and a tenth of those levels seems possible with careful organization and discipline. Then people would be able to move easily to late-blooming societies which accelerated progress through their choice of the happiness path to development. Simultaneously, some talented, energetic individuals who started poor could use the Internet to gain entry into the circle of world servers within a lifetime. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

TI Future prospects of voluntary health insurance in Thailand
SO HEALTH POLICY AND PLANNING
LA English
DT Article
ID COMMUNITY
AB Voluntary health insurance schemes in Thailand are still under development and have yet to seriously address the questions of equity and efficiency, while private health insurance is limited to people who can afford the premium. One form of insurance, commonly known as the health insurance card scheme, was first introduced as the Health Card Program in '1983. This program is based on risk sharing of health expenditures, with no cost sharing, in a voluntary health insurance prepayment scheme. With the uncertain performance of the Thai economy, program sustainability and the efficient use of resources are major concerns, The Health Card Program needs enough enrollees to ensure a sufficient pool of risks. This study looks at health card purchase and utilization patterns, using data from Khon Kaen Province, and finds that employment, education levels and the presence of illness are significant factors influencing card purchase. The last factor is related to the problem of adverse selection of the program; families with symptoms of sickness are more likely to buy cards, resulting in greater use of health services. The results also show an improvement in accessibility to health care and a high level of satisfaction among card holders, both key objectives of the program. It is suggested that changes in the health card system could enable it to evolve into a community-based compulsory health insurance scheme for rural areas.

DE benefits; challenges; changes; choices
AB The Heartbeat Challenge programme of the National Heart Foundation of New Zealand develops the commitment of workplaces to creating an environment that reduces barriers and increases opportunities to improve and maintain health. Workplaces choose to make healthy lifestyle changes from a broad range of strategies encompassing elements of healthy food choices, promoting regular physical activity and being smoke free. An award is achieved on meeting the necessary criteria. Results of programme monitoring from 159 workplaces indicate that Heartbeat Challenge has created a supportive health environment in workplaces. Changes were made by 99% of workplaces to meet the award criteria. In the areas of healthy food, physical activity and smoke free, 92, 86 and 94% of workplaces met more than the required five criteria, respectively, and met an average of 3.5, 3.5 and 3.0 more criteria, respectively, when achieving a Heartbeat Challenge compared to initial participation. Heartbeat Challenge has been successful in a wide variety of types and sizes of workplaces with the added benefit of improving staffs' attitudes about the workplace, the company and themselves. Structural changes have occurred which are sustainable, and have created an environment which has the potential to improve the health of a large segment of the working population.

TI Estate-based regeneration in England: Lessons from Housing Action Trusts
SO HOUSING STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper presents an interim assessment of Housing Action Trusts (HATs)-special purpose, limited duration, Government agencies-charged with the task of comprehensively regenerating run-down housing estates in England. HATs' track record remains under-analysed despite the large sums of public money involved and their relevance to the latest experiments in estate regeneration. The paper briefly profiles the six HATs' designated areas, then assesses the degree to which they have achieved their main objectives. HATs have thus far had mixed success. They have attached greater priority to employment and training and quality of life measures, community empowerment and sustainability than earlier estate regeneration programmes. However, they have still devoted the lion's share of their resources to housing investment and the question remains whether they have gone far enough in tackling the deep-roofed social and economic problems of deprived neighbourhoods. HATs have proved relatively expensive compared with alternative methods of injecting new investment into social housing, largely because of their emphasis upon durable design, good space standards and energy efficiency and also resident empowerment and wider measures. Only time will tell whether the extra cost is justified.

AB There is a prohibition on the use of modern external inputs, such as chemical fertilizers, in Baduy swidden farming. Ordinarily, the consequence of this in a situation of acute forest pressure would be a decrease in fallow rimes, and an inevitable depletion of soil fertility. The Baduy (particularly Outer Baduy) have several ways of alleviating this problem, one of which is the introduction of Paraserianthes (Albizia) falcataria. By alternating this commercially valuable perennial leguminous tree with rice, soil fertility is maintained and the socio-economic position of the Baduy improved. As a result, swidden farming, which is considered by the Baduy to be central to their cultural identity, continues to be viable, despite increasing population density and the continuing depletion of mature forest.

ID REGIMES
AB Ongoing changes in world fisheries, including those in the United States, are having: dramatic impacts on fishers, their families, and their communities. The key drivers of these changes have been identified its open access and overcapitalization. The prevailing models being considered for addressing these issues are Firmly rooted in the tenets of neoclassical economic theory and focus on establishing property rights or privileges in fisheries. The National Research Council has recently recommended that Congress lift the moratorium on the development of individual fishing quota (IFQ) programs established by the Sustainable Fisheries Act of 1996. In particular, among mainstream managers, a particular Form of IFQ. the individual transferable quota (ITQ) has come to be viewed as the management tool of choice. ITQs, quasiprivatized property rights allocated to individual fishers, are expected to "rationalize" the fishery through market forces. Externalities (costs that fall outside the market process) associated with ITQs, however, may preclude them from achieving either their biological or economic goals. Meantime, they may cause significant social impacts. Rather than allocating transferable quotas to individuals, allocating them to communities (CTQs) may capture the benefits of ITQs while minimizing social impacts and internalizing externalities (assuring that those who reap the benefits bear the costs). Recent work on property rights in resource management provides a model fur how CTQs could be structured.

AB To meet out the demand of the specific commodities by sustaining the crop productivity and soil fertility, there is need to diversify the traditional rice (Oryza sativa L.)-wheat [Triticum aestivum L. emend. Fiori & Paol.] sequence that occupies 60-70% of the total cultivated area in eastern Uttar Pradesh. The findings of field trials, conducted for 4 years at the University Research Farm, Faizabad, revealed that among the six cropping systems tested, rice-potato (Solanum uberosum L.)-cowpea. [Vigna unguiculata (L.) Warp.] provided the highest net profit of Rs 21,154/ha/yr and rice grain/equivalent yield of 22.55 t/ha besides the fertility benefit of legume crop. The second remunerative system was rice-potato-okra (seed), that showed the rice-equivalent yield potential of 20.02 t/ha and net profit of Rs 17,612/ha/yr due to vegetable cash crop.

AB The relation between agricultural resources, industrial activities and the environment has complex aspects because of many dynamic interrelationships. Among the sectors that are showing a certain environmental sensibility, there is the textile one, and particularly the cotton sector. Cotton is one of the most important non-food crops in the world. Its products are destined to different industries: textiles, food, chemicals and so on. In Italy, cotton cultivation encounters economic problems that makes its development quite difficult. In this paper, the development opportunities in agricultural and manufacturing processes are analysed in view of new trends that are characterised by sustainable life-cycle assessments.

AB Around the world energy supply is being liberalised, with electricity and gas exported across national boundaries. Received wisdom is that secure, diverse, and sustainable energy supply will be provided by the market. It is paradoxical that countries such as the USA and UK which are further down the route to liberalisation are also the most regulated. Perhaps more important, the market does not value the environment - witness 'the dash for cheap gas' - at a time when non-carbon dioxide emitting technologies such as renewables and nuclear energy must increase their share of electricity generation if the Kyoto Protocol obligations are to be achieved.

TI Modelling sustainable urban development by the integration of
   constrained cellular automata and GIS
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SCIENCE

ID LAND-DEVELOPMENT
AB Cellular Automata (CA) have attracted growing attention in urban simulation because their capability in spatial modelling is not fully developed in GIS. This paper discusses how cellular automata (CA) can be extended and integrated with GIS to help planners to search for better urban forms for sustainable development. The cellular automata model is built within a grid-GIS system to facilitate easy access to GIS databases for constructing the constraints. The essence of the model is that constraint space is used to regulate cellular space. Local, regional and global constraints play important roles in affecting modelling results. In addition, 'grey' cells are defined to represent the degrees or percentages of urban land development during the iterations of modelling for more accurate results. The model can be easily controlled by the parameter k using a power transformation function for calculating the constraint scores. It can be used as a useful planning tool to test the effects of different urban development scenarios.

AB War and the preparation for war divert increasingly scarce resources from civilian use, especially long-term efforts such as the quest for sustainable use of the planet. War also damages natural systems both directly and indirectly. As a consequence, ecosystem services essential to sustainability are diminished. Achieving world peace does not assure that sustainable use of the planet will also be achieved, but. it is a necessary precursor. Other factors diminishing the prospects for sustainability include major and rapid demographic changes, addiction to exponential economic growth, excessive individualism, and production of artifacts and wastes not readily reincorporated into natural systems. On the other hand, if intelligence is not an evolutionary mistake, then it, combined with reason and creativity, can be used to overcome the obstacles just mentioned. If intelligence is an evolutionary mistake, the creatures that ran the world before humans appeared will doubtless take over again.

ID COSMOPOLITES-SORDIDUS GERMAR; BANANA WEEVIL; UGANDA
AB Plantain (Musa AAB), a primary food crop in Ghana, is a key component in sustainable agricultural systems in high rainfall zones. Recently, there has been a substantial yield decline and reduction in plantation life. To elucidate the context in which intervention strategies should be developed, a Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) was conducted at five villages in the major plantain-producing belt of Ghana. The importance of plantain as a preferred food was confirmed, although farmers tended to sell plantain for cash income, using cheaper, less preferred alternatives for home consumption. Farmers identified decreasing soil fertility, the high cost of labour for weeding, pests and diseases, lack of good quality planting material and marketing-related issues as the major production constraints. Due to declining productivity in less fertile regions, plantain has been replaced with other food crops such as cassava and maize. Farmers over-estimated the importance of insect pests but were unaware of the extensive damage that could be caused by nematodes and the foliar disease, black sigatoka. They observed, however, that pest damage is more severe when soil fertility is poor. Clearly, integrated pest management is likely to be most effective when practiced within the context of cropping systems management; sustainable strategies that are being developed for resource-limited plantain farmers in Ghana are discussed.

   Indian Central Himalaya
AB The Indian republic contains a large number of tribal communities with varied cultures. Efforts to develop these communities by the government of India and the provincial governments continue to be important in the post-independence planning era, and perceptible development has occurred in the socio-economic and demographic areas. However, expected goals have not been achieved and differing socioeconomic and demographic developments are still found in tribal communities, even within the same ecosystem. In this paper, an effort is made to characterize the differential trends of socioeconomic and demographic development among two mountain tribes - the Jaunsaries and the Bhotias - inhabiting the Indian Central Himalayan region. With the exception of altitudinal variation, the Central Himalayan region of India is governed by a set of more or less similar geophysical and environmental conditions. However, discernible differences in socio-economic and demographic developments are found in these tribal communities, and are affected by the economy and culture of the tribal communities. The findings suggest that economic and cultural advantages and limitations should be appropriately integrated in planning to make development efforts more meaningful and sustainable.

AB Today in Latin America there are still regions with microcosms of traditional farming systems, (i.e. in Mesoamerica, the Andean region, and the Amazon Basin) that have emerged over centuries of cultural and biological evolution. These are based on locally available resources and the cultivation of a diversity of crops and varieties in time and space, and have allowed traditional farmers to maximize harvest security and the multiple use of the landscape with limited environmental impact. Agro-biodiverse traditional agroecosystems represent a strategy which ensures diverse diets and income sources, stable production, minimum risk, efficient use of land resources, and enhanced ecological integrity. This legacy of traditional agriculture demonstrates that the combination of stable and diverse production, internally generated and maintainable inputs, favourable energy input/output ratios, and articulation with both subsistence and market needs, comprises an effective approach to achieve food security, income generation, and environmental conservation. Traditional approaches represent multiple use strategies that enhance the multifunctional nature of agriculture, an important feature for the health of rural regions in the next century.

DE technology assessment; biomedical; delivery of health care; Portugal
AB The Portuguese healthcare system is often portrayed as a National Health Service (NHS) model, characterized by universal coverage, comprehensive benefits, nearly free services, national tax financing, and public ownership or control of the factors of production. However, in reality the system fails to accomplish these features in a complete way. There coexist a number of occupation-related health insurance schemes that were originally intended to be integrated into the NHS. in addition, in key areas the NHS does not provide the wide range of services it promises. The public sector has a predominant role in the provision of hospital stays and general practitioner consultations, but the private sector provides a major portion of specialist consultations, dental consultations, and diagnostic services. Major problems in the system led to health reforms in the 1990s. New reform proposals include some specific steps concerning health technology, including standards for medical equipment based on quality, geographic distribution, sustainability, and cost-effectiveness. A new National Plan of Health Equipment was completed in 1998, aimed at improving the distribution of equipment Despite reforms, healthcare expenditures continue to rise. There is general agreement that gains in efficiency could be made. This situation is beginning to encourage interest in health technology assessment (HTA) in Portugal, although these activities are not yet very developed. Recently, legislation requiring presentation of economic evaluations for new pharmaceutical products was enacted. Present plans also call for the creation in the future of a national agency for HTA.

TI The Republic of Korea: the taming of the tiger
SO INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL SCIENCE JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB In the past decade, the Republic of Korea has evolved from a developmental state toward a minimalist state, as it has adapted to world market conditions. Through the 1980s, many saw the Korean economy as a model to be admired, but this changed with the economic downturn of the 1990s. When Korean private industries lost their international competitiveness, the government swiftly changed its policy to move more into compliance with world market forces. The country's bureaucrats and economists shared a view that, by reducing direct intervention in the economy and by managing macroeconomic stability, they could once again encourage sustainable economic growth. In a sense, the private sector had grown beyond the state's capability to support industries more directly under the old model of the 'tiger' economy. In the model that emerged in the 1990s, however, the government still exercises informal or discreet intervention in the transition process reward a minimalist state.

TI Contestability and the indeterminacy of free-entry equilibria
SO JAPANESE ECONOMIC REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
ID COURNOT EQUILIBRIUM; NATURAL MONOPOLY; SUSTAINABILITY
AB A general notion of market perfect contestability is introduced. It coincides with the definition given by Baumol ei al. under Bertrand competition, but is compatible with Cournot competition as well as monopolistic competition. Using this notion, we illustrate the fact that the number of active firms in free-entry equilibrium may be largely indeterminate and different levels of positive profits may in many cases be sustained. This is shown to be true, in spite of market perfect contestability, under either Cournot competition or product differentiation. Examples are given for both cases. Appropriate conditions of increasing returns are required. JEL Classification Numbers: D5, D43.

TI Participatory appraisal approaches versus sample survey data collection:
   a case of smallholder farmers well-being ranking in Njombe District,
   Tanzania
SO JOURNAL OF AFRICAN ECONOMIES
LA English
DT Article
ID WEALTH RANKING
AB Social scientists and rural development interventionists in Tanzania and in Sub-Saharan Africa depend mainly on conventional sample surveys; in part this is a legacy of their basic training. Participatory rural appraisal and intervention approaches offer a varied range of methods. We ask ourselves whether the results from participatory, rapid appraisals are conflicting and different to those from sample surveys? This paper compares results of a Rapid Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) with a conventional sample survey. These surveys were conducted at the end of 1995 and mid-1996 respectively, to establish socio-economic wellbeing ranks in Njombe district. A comparison of results shows that the well-being ranks established using PRA are valid and the approach is reliable. The three qualitatively established well-being ranks differed empirically in many socio-economic indicators. These include resource endowment, labour force size, agricultural land, livestock ownership, forest woodlot management, perception of food insecurity, technological advances in agricultural production and natural resource management systems. Results show that the low well-being group and female-headed households are disadvantaged. The goal of the Hifadhi Ya Mazingira-Njombe project is to develop environmentally sustainable crop and livestock husbandry practices in the district. The well-being ranking exercise has strong implications for the project's strategy. We discuss the adopted methodology and implications. The paper recommends that development programmes and workers in Tanzania and Sub-Saharan Africa ought to extend their approaches. It is time to include more of the participatory, relatively rapid rural appraisal and intervention techniques. Benefits that they may accrue are time saving, lower costs, quality information and stakeholder involvement.

TI An explosive subsoiler for the improvement of meadow soil, part 3: Field
   experiments
SO JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ENGINEERING RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB An explosive subsoiler was envisaged for the achievement of greater soil rupture volume and longer sustainability of drainage to improve meadow soil. A prototype explosive subsoiler was designed and built in Japan and sent to China, and actual field tests were conducted in a meadow soil field. This paper details the performance of the explosive subsoiler in the meadow soil.
   The results showed that when the soil penetration resistance was less than 3.0 MPa, and gas of 10 g/s was injected, a pressure of about 5 kPa was produced at the nozzle port. A base draught of about 20 kN, which was measured when no gas was injected, was reduced to 15 kN. The trace of the subsoiler remained in the soil horizon, and a cavity was formed on the trace of the subsoiler chisel. When the soil penetration resistance was more than 3.0 MPa, the draught reduction could not be obtained even with the pressure produced on the nozzle port. There was a chisel trace in the soil horizon, but there was no cavity formation by the injected gas. The draught of the mouldboard plough body which tilled the Ap horizon was about 10 kN with a working depth of 200 mm. The mean base draught of the subsoiler body, which broke the A and Cg1 horizons, was about 10 kN at 478 mm depth from the soil surface, about 20 kN at 539 mm depth and about 30 kN at the 600 mm depth.

AB What me do is determined by the way we "view" a complex issue and what sample of issues or events me choose to deal with. In this paper, a model based on a communal, cultural, or people-centered worldview, informed by a subjective epistemology and a holistic ontology, is considered. Definitions and interpretations of sustainable agriculture are reviewed. Common elements in published definitions of sustainable agriculture and animal production among those who seek long-term and equitable solutions for food production are resource efficiency, profitability, productivity, environmental soundness, biodiversity, social viability, and ethical aspects. Possible characteristics of future sustainable production systems and further development are presented. The impact of these characteristics on animal breeding goals is reviewed. The need for long-term biologically, ecologically, and sociologically sound breeding goals is emphasized, because animal breeding determined only by short-term market forces leads to unwanted side effects. Hence, a procedure for defining animal breeding goals with ethical priorities and weighing of market and non-market values is suggested. Implementation of non-market as well as market economic trait values in the aggregate genotype, as suggested, may allow for breeding programs that contribute to sustainable production systems. Examples of breeding goals in salmon, cattle, and pigs are given, and the resulting genetic responses are evaluated with respect to economic profit (or costs) and other criteria of sustainability. Important prerequisites for breeding programs for sustainable production are appropriate governmental policies, awareness of our way of thinking, and a more communal worldview informed by a subjective epistemology and a holistic ontology.

Forty-nine subjects--volunteers (76 eyes) with an average age of 65.3 +/- 7.0 years were enrolled and randomized into two groups at diagnosis of senile cataract. Changes in lens clarity were measured and quantitated over 6 to 24 months thereafter. Patients administered 1% N-alpha-acetylcarnosine (NACA) (26 patients, 41 eyes = Group II), placebo composition (13 patients, 21 eyes) topically (two drops, twice daily) to the conjunctival sac, or were untreated (10 patients, 14 eyes); two latter groups of patients were combined into the control (reference) group I. Patients were evaluated upon entry, at every 2-month (Trial 1) and 6-month (Trial 2) intervals for best corrected visual acuity (b/c VA), by ophthalmoscopy, original techniques of glare test (Trial I), stereocinematographic slit-image and retro-illumination photography with subsequent interactive digital image analysis and 3D computer graphics of the lens light scattering/absorbing centers. The intra-reader reproducibility of measuring techniques for cataractous changes was good with the overall average of correlation coefficients for image analytical data 0.830 and glare test readings 0.998. Group I of patients demonstrated the variability in densitometric readings of lens cloudings, negative advance in glare sensitivity over 6 months, and gradual deterioration of VA and gross transmissivity of lenses over 24 months comparatively to baseline and the 6-month follow-up examinations. As compared with baseline examination, over 6 months 41.5% of the eyes treated with NACA presented a significant improvement of the gross transmissivity degree of lenses, 90.0% of the eyes showed a gradual improvement in VA to 7-100% and 88.9% of the eyes ranged a 27-100% improvement in glare sensitivity. Topographic study demonstrated less density and corresponding areas of opacification in posterior subcapsular and cortical morphological regions of the lens consistent with VA up to 0.3. The total study period over 24 months revealed that the beneficial effect of NACA is sustainable. No cases resulted in a worsening of VA and image analytical readings of lenses in the NACA-treated group of patients. In most of the patients drug tolerance was good. Statistical analysis revealed the significant differences over 6 and 24 months in cumulative positive changes of overall characteristics of cataracts in the NACA-treated group II from the control group I. The N-acetylated imidazole-containing peptidomimetic NACA is proposed as an effective and physiologically acceptable drug for nonsurgical treatment of age-related and senile cataracts.

AB Canada's historic places connect us to our past. Looking back over the last few decades, this article examines the creation of government institutions and programmes to support heritage commemoration and explores the thematic development of Canada's national historic sites system. The definition of historic place has expanded from single properties to a multiplicity of building types found in large historic centres as well as cultural landscapes. Management practices and policy developments have taken place against a backdrop of international professional charters. Now, historic places are increasingly valued for their contributions to sustainable and social development. In order to ensure their survival, innovative strategies will be needed to create the institutions and tools necessary to create a culture of conservation. Success will be measured by the degree to which Canadians value, understand and respect this legacy of historic places that connect us to the story of Canada.

TI Churches, tobacco farmers, and community sustainability: Insights from
   the tobacco south
SO JOURNAL OF COMMUNITY PSYCHOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID HEALTH
AB American tobacco farmers and the communities in which they live face an increasingly uncertain and tenuous future. In many rural American communities, churches function as the moral and social compass that,guides community life. In North Carolina's rural communities, churches and tobacco are inseparable. Indeed churches in tobacco-dependent communities are often referred to as tobacco churches. These churches experience tensions and contradictions that exist within the multiple cultures of which they are a part: denominations, banks, locally owned businesses, schools, and community centers, Ethical dilemmas abound as the moral dimensions of public health and livelihood are weighed against the backdrop of the common good. This article will give an overview of the conflict, then delve more deeply into the historical and societal components that have shaped the tobacco culture and the roles, past, present and future that churches have or could play. Current pressures related to public health and rural economic viability will be examined. Cases illustrating the possible central role of the church at both the local and regional level will be presented to build an argument for the constructive role of the church for communities undergoing, radical social, economic, and cultural change.

TI A sustainable programme to prevent falls and near falls in community
   dwelling older people: results of a randomised trial
SO JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY AND COMMUNITY HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
ID CIRCUMSTANCES; INTERVENTION; ADULTS; RISK
AB Study objective-In the causative mechanism of falls among older community dwellers, slips and trips have been found to be significant precursors. The purpose of the two year trial was to assess the effectiveness of multi-component interventions targeting major risk factors for falls in reducing the incidence of slips, trips and falls among the well, older community.
   Design-Four groups with approximately equal numbers of participants were randomly allocated to interventions. The prevention strategies included education and awareness raising of falls risk factors, exercise sessions to improve strength and balance, home safety advice to modify environmental hazards, and medical assessment to optimise health. The interventions combined the strategies in an add on approach. The first intervention group receiving the information session only was regarded as the control. The outcome of interest was the occurrence of a slip, trip or fall, monitored prospectively using a daily calendar diary.
   Participants and setting-Two hundred and fifty two members of the National Seniors Association in the Brisbane district agreed to participate. National Seniors clubs provide a forum for active, community dwelling Australians aged 50 and over to participate in policy, personal development and recreation.
   Main results-Using Cox's proportional hazards regression model, adjusted hazard ratios comparing intervention groups with the control ranged from 0.35 (95% CI 0.17, 0.73) to 0.48 (0.25, 0.91) for slips; 0.29 (0.16, 0.51) to 0.45 (0.27, 0.74) for trips; and 0.60 (0.36, 1.01) to 0.82 (0.51, 1.31) for falls. While calendar monitoring recorded outcome, it was also assessed as a prevention strategy by comparing the intervention groups with a hypothetical non-intervened group. At one year after intervention, reductions in the probability of slips, trips and falls (61(95%CI 54, 66)%; 56 (49, 63)%; 29 (22, 36)% respectively) were demonstrated.
   Conclusions-This study makes an important contribution to the priority community health issue of falls prevention by showing that effective, sustainable, low cost programmes can be introduced through community-based organisations to reduce the incidence of slips, trips and falls in well, older people.

TI Forest fragmentation - Implications for sustainable private forests
SO JOURNAL OF FORESTRY
LA English
DT Article
AB The long-term trend for private forests in the United States is that of more people owning smaller pieces of wooded rand for amenity values. This trend shows no sign of slowing, and indications are that it may be speeding up. The fragmenting of forests into smaller pieces appears to be driven by powerful social and demographic forces that consistently undertax and overserve developed areas, while overtaxing and underserving traditional rural land uses, such as forestry.

AB We introduce an initiative to assess and compare landscape changes related to human activities on a global scale, using a single group of invertebrates. The GLOBENET programme uses common field methodology (pitfall trapping), to appraise assemblages of ground beetles (Coleoptera, Carabidae) in visually-similar land-mosaics (urban-rural gradients). Carabids were selected as the focal taxon as they are sufficiently varied (both taxonomically and ecologically), abundant and sensitive to the environment. However, work on other taxa is comparable with the GLOBENET framework. The continuum of decreasing human pressure from city centres into the surrounding countryside was selected to represent human-caused disturbance for this initial stage of GLOBENET because these gradients can be found virtually all over the world. Through the broad-scale assessment envisioned in the GLOBENET programme, we seek to separate general, repeated effects on biodiversity from those that depend on local environments or particular biotic assemblages. Based on this understanding we aim to develop simple tools and protocols for assessing ecological effects of human-caused landscape changes, which could help to sustainably manage landscapes for biodiversity and for human requirements. For instance, the response of different functional groups of carabids to these landscape changes may help guide management practices. Further GLOBENET developments and information are available at our website: http://www.helsinki.fi/science/globenet/

TI Border irrigation field experiment. II: Salt transport
SO JOURNAL OF IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
ID CRACKING SOILS
AB This paper presents results from an experiment to measure the salt transport processes within a border-irrigated bay in northern Victoria, Australia, an area with shallow saline ground water and cracking soils. The overland flow and drainage salinity measurements showed that lateral surface washoff of salt from the soil surface was the main process of salt transport into surface water. Soil salinity measurments showed that, although salt was removed from the near-surface soil, there was negligible leaching downward through the profile. This was due to the near saturation of the soil, the presence of cracks that minimize die vertical leaching, as well as the lack of deep drainage of ground water. These findings highlight the importance of lateral washoff in the transfer of salt from irrigation bays. suggesting that reduction in irrigation event volumes is likely to reduce salt export and thus affect the sustainability of irrigation in this area.

AB Using the multicointegration framework suggested by Granger and Lee (1989, 1990) and developed in Engsted, Gonzalo and Haldrup (1997) and Haldrup (1997) this study explores the long-run relationship between components of the U.S, current account during two periods, 1947:i-1973:iv and 1974:i-1994:ii. The paper develops the concept of sustainability of external imbalances in an environment that is non-deterministic and characterized by uncertainty. The sustainability criteria are related to multicointegration. Evidence consistent with sustainable intertemporal external budgeting in the fixed exchange rate era is presented. In the post Bretton Woods period there is no support for sustainable external budgeting. Policy issues and factors that affect sustainability are discussed.

AB A material endures elastic-plastic deformation to the point where the mean stress reaches the maximum sustainable equi-cohesive bonding stress. in this note a proposed new ductile fracture criterion is developed from the theory of fracture toughness under different mean stress from that of the tensile test. Brittle fracture occurs during elastic deformation, which latter is induced by variation in the mean stress. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved.

AB An analysis is made of contact damage in brittle coatings on metal substrates, using a case study of a dental porcelain coating of thickness between 0.1 and 1 mm fused onto a Pd alloy base, with spherical indenter of radii 2.38 and 3.98 mm. At large coating thicknesses (>300 mu m), the first damage takes the form of surface-initiated transverse cone cracks outside the contact. At small coating thicknesses (<300 mu m), the first damage occurs as yield in the substrate, with attendant formation of subsurface transverse median cracks in the coating. At high loads and thin coatings, both forms of transverse cracking occur, along with subsequent delamination of the ceramic/metal interface, signalling impending failure. Conditions for avoiding such transverse cracking are considered in terms of minimum coating thicknesses and maximum sustainable contact loads. General implications concerning the design of brittle coating systems for optimum damage resistance are considered, with special reference to dental crowns.

ID GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION-SYSTEMS; SUPPORT SYSTEMS; PERSPECTIVE
AB Geographic information systems (GIS) assume an increasingly large role in North American land use planning. Although GIS is often promoted as an answer to both democratic and sustainability issues in planning, this paper calls these premises into question and suggests a less ambitious role for GIS technology in the planning process in the new millennium. The contributions of critical theory to conceptions of decision making and action in planning, as well. as a case comparison study of government GIS systems and those of community groups in British Columbia's Gulf Islands are considered. Both strains of argument lead to the conclusion that more than new technology, fresh commitments to communicate and to share planning power and responsibility are needed for more democratic, interactive land use planning.

AB Fuel cell power plants have demonstrated high efficiency, environmental friendliness, excellent transient response, and superior reliability and durability in spacecraft and stationary applications. Broader application of fuel cell technology promises significant contribution to sustainable global economic growth, but requires improvement to size, cost, fuel flexibility and operating flexibility. International Fuel Cells (IFC) is applying lessons learned from delivery of more than 425 fuel cell power plants and 3 million h of operation to the development of product technology which captures that promise. Key findings at the fuel cell power plant level include: (1) ancillary components account for more than 40% of the weight and nearly all unscheduled outages of hydrocarbon-fuelled power plants; a higher level of integration and simplification is required to achieve reasonable characteristics, (2) hydrocarbon,on fuel cell power plant components are highly interactive; the fuel processing approach and power plant operating pressure are major determinants of overall efficiency, and (3) achieving the durability required fdr heavy duty vehicles and stationary applications requires simultaneous satisfaction of electrochemical, materials and mechanical considerations in the design of the cell stack and other power plant components. Practical designs must minimize application specific equipment. Related lessons for stationary fuel cell power plants include: (1) within fuel specification limits, natural gas varies widely in heating value, minor constituents such as oxygen and nitrogen content and trace compounds such as the odorant; (2) city water quality varies widely; recovery of product water for process use avoids costly, complicated and site-specific water treatment systems, but water treatment is required to eliminate impurities and (3) the embedded protection functions for reliable operation of fuel cell power conditioners meet or exceed those required for connection to the utility grid, but: current standards do not recognize embedded protection functions, and, often, utilities mandate external protective devices. Consequently, current activity to develop such standards under IEEE auspices is important in eliminating the cost of extra protection equipment. Key fuel cell lessons learned from IFC's experience base along with the status of development for future vehicle and stationary power plants at IFC are discussed. These lessons have been applied to the 200 kW stationary fuel cell power plant as the information has become available. They are now being applied to a 50-kW, ambient pressure, polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cell power plant that uses gasoline as the fuel. This power plant is intended for experimental bench testing demonstrations associated with vehicle power plans applications. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved.

AB The definition of sustainability is still under discussion, but it is becoming increasingly clear that present practices of energy supply and distribution are causing severe environmental pressures, and that they cannot be continued indefinitely. The fuel cell has been undergoing rapid development and is now at a stage immediately prior to commercialisation for a number of markets. It is expected to be economically competitive with many other energy conversion technologies within the next 5 years. However, introduction of the fuel cell may also speed the economic introduction of emissions-free energy carriers such as hydrogen, linking directly to renewably generated electricity. Hydrogen could be used as a form of energy storage in cases where electricity demand and supply were not matched. The fuel cell would then be complementary to, rather than competitive with, renewable generation technologies. Ultimately, the fuel cell, in both its high and low-temperature derivatives, could become one of the pillars of a future sustainable energy system. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved.

AB The European Union (EU) approach to fuel cell development should be viewed within the wider context of energy and environment policy. The energy policy is built on four main pillars - ensuring security of supply including the long term substitution of fossil fuels, improving competitiveness, achieving greater sustainability, and developing clean, efficient energy technologies. The prospect of fuel cells, as well as other technologies, to contribute positively to all these aspects of energy policy is widely recognised. Fuel cells can exploit diversified primary energy sources including renewable, and offer intrinsically clean, highly efficient energy conversion. Over successive Framework Programmes for Research, the European Commission has increased its financial support to fuel cell RTD&D. The recently launched Fifth Framework Programme introduces a problem-solving approach in which fuel cells will have to compete for funding support by demonstrating their ability to achieve ambitious cost and performance targets.

AB This paper examines how the issue of political support affects the design of social insurance. It distinguishes between redistributive character and size of social protection. Three main results emerge. First, it may be appropriate to adopt a system which is less redistributive than otherwise optimal, in order to ensure political support for an adequate level of coverage in the second (voting) stage. Second, supplementary private insurance may increase the welfare of the poor, even if it is effectively bought only by the rich. Third, the case for prohibiting (supplementary) private insurance may become stronger when the efficiency of private insurance markets increases. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved.

ID AUSTRALIA; ISSUES
AB For several decades writers have posited a fundamental conflict between environmental protection and economic development. These arguments-linked to ideas of either an impending catastrophe the environmentalist perspective) or human ingenuity and its capacity to deal with environmental threats through economic progress (the pro-development perspective)-have given rise to new political movements. This has prompted established political organisations to emphasise aspects of the environmentalist discourse (like preserving nature for future generations) and utilitarian arguments (like the recreational and aesthetic value of nature). Notions of sustainable development have been a pivotal feature of this response since they are founded on apparently conflicting values. This paper therefore uses recent survey research to explore the relationship between values (be they 'ecocentric' or pro-development or utilitarian) and political predispositions relating to the environment. The central findings relate to the strong link between political predispositions and ecocentric or pro-development values, the weak link with utilitarian values, and the implications of sustainable development strategies.

ID 10-YEAR FOLLOW-UP; SEVERE OBESITY; PROGRAM
AB The prevalence of obesity has been on the increase and, on the whole, improvements in patient education have not led to the desired outcome of weight maintenance - let alone weight loss. For some time therapeutic techniques derived from behavioural psychology such as self-monitoring stimulus control and goal setting, have been incorporated as adjuncts to the treatment of weight problems - intended to help obese people make positive changes tb their eating and activity habits. In more recent decades, behaviour modification approaches have also incorporated strategies from cognitive therapy, which have involved the identification and modification of 'dysfunctional' thinking patterns and consequent negative mood states; hence the term 'cognitive behaviour therapy' (CBT). There is increasing interest in adopting CBT approaches to achieve more modest and sustainable weight loss and improved psychological well-being. It is possible to train non-psychologists to use CBT strategies, though the level of training required for effective delivery has not yet been established. While CBT is not a panacea for problems of overweight it does offer additional treatment choice for some - and is compatible, as an adjunct, with other forms of obesity management.

TI Longitudinal assessment of transportation planning forecasts
SO JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING-ASCE
LA English
DT Article
AB Transportation planning applications typically calibrate models for a base year and then make forecast year projections. However, modelers rarely evaluate the accuracy of their forecasts by using past data sets to predict present conditions. This is complicated by the fact that longitudinal data sets for a geographical area exhibit data incompatibility, shifts in planning emphasis, temporal changes in travel characteristics, and added modeling complexity. In addition, if new data elements are needed for model improvement, these will not be available with the historical data set. In an effort to test the feasibility of using older planning data to predict the present, a case study area for which transportation planning data were available was selected at three points in time over a 25-year period. This facilitated comparison of longitudinal data sets, development of base year models, and subsequent testing of their performance for a forecast year application. This paper discusses the experience of creating a longitudinal data set for such testing and illustrations how one can use longitudinal data to ascertain the sustainability of model structures over time. Some simple workable approaches are illustrated; although these are more aggregate than desired, they convey how one may devise models that can function both in the base year and then, later, in the forecast year, in spite of changes in transportation and land use activity.

AB All individuals of Cedrela lilloi (a valuable timber species of Meliaceae) > 4 cm DBH were sampled in three rectangular plots (c. 15 000 m(2) each) in northwestern Argentina subtropical montane forests between 850 and 1350 m. Regeneration dynamics of C. lilloi was characterized by testing two hypotheses: (i) C. lilloi has a gap-phase regeneration mode, which implies a negative exponential size/age distribution at forest stand scale, growth releases due to canopy openings, and juvenile trees clumped at spatial scales of treefall gaps. (ii) There is a negative spatial association between adults and juveniles of C. lilloi which could be caused by density dependent mortality. Despite differences in age structure, diameter distribution approximated a negative exponential curve at all sites. Radial growth, measured as tree-ring widths, averaged between 2 and 4 mm y(-1) which is comparable to fast growing tropical species in mature forests. Aggregation of juveniles peaked at radial distances of 8 to 15 m. Size structure, growth and spatial patterns of juveniles support the first hypothesis. In support of the second hypothesis, juveniles showed a negative spatial association with conspecific mature trees at spatial scales of less than 20 m. The Janzen-Connell model of density-dependence is one potential explanation for this pattern. Although regeneration and growth patterns of C. lilloi suggest a potential for sustainable management based on small-scale gaps, spatial dynamics at stand-scale need to be considered to ensure the regeneration of mature trees.

ID RESTORATION ECOLOGY; LAKES
AB Rehabilitation of the post-mining landscape of Lower Lusatia (Brandenburg, Germany) represents a complex problem: 85 per cent of this area is currently being recultivated for forests or agriculture and 15 per cent is reserved for nature development. After mining, soil conditions are dry, acidic and nutrient poor. The 'LENAB' project aimed at conservation strategies and management options for natural habitats. Two competing basic motives of nature conservation on a small or medium scale were defined: (1) close-to-naturalness (allowing natural dynamics to take place without human interference) and (2) biodiversity (selective species and habitat protection). An overall strategy for sustainability of a cultural landscape can only be applied to the entire post-mining landscape. The application of the two basic motives leads to different management options; this is illustrated by two important vegetation types. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Intensification of land use can become a threat to agricultural sustainability if they lead to increased soil erosion. This study examines land-use changes, soil and water conservation, soil erosion and soil productivity in the Highlands of Kenya. In addition, it examines farmers' perception of livelihood changes. Land-use changes were determined from interpretations of aerial photographs taken in 1960 and 1996. Additional information on land use, soil and water conservation and livelihood changes were obtained from discussions and interviews with farmers, as well as from field verifications of the most recent aerial photographs. Soil samples were analysed and soil erosion assessed according to the PLUS classification scheme. The results indicate that substantial changes in land use, such as introduction of coffee and high-yielding maize, and fragmentation of land holdings have taken place. Less land was conserved in 1996 as compared to 1960. Moreover, SWC practices have changed from fanya chini terraces and shifting cultivation to bench terraces and permanent cultivation. Rates of soil nutrients (organic C, N and K) and maize-yield levels decreased significantly with increasing erosion. Farmers' perception of livelihood changes was differentiated according to farmers' off-farm resource 60 per cent of the farmers depended on income from the land and thought livelihoods were better in the 1960s. It is concluded that more efforts to decrease soil erosion and investments in land and labour are necessary to sustain soil productivity and hence secure rural livelihoods.

AB A principal challenge in erosion control is the integration of the many technical and non-technical issues that affect the acceptance of soil conservation measures by land users. This first paper in a three-part series considers the main criteria at farm level: biophysical efficiency; productivity and sustainability; and socio-economic acceptability. A model is developed to integrate these various components into a decision-making framework for soil conservation at the farm level. With the particular conditions of the Loess Plateau in China, land degradation comprises a number of key biophysical and socioeconomic variables. The model components therefore include available water storage capacity of the soil as an index of productivity, the organic matter and mineral soil balance to reflect the major changes to the soil when eroded, and cost-benefit analysis to determine the economic wisdom of devoting household resources to land improvement. The model is calibrated using data from the Nihegou Catchment near Chunhua in the southern part of the Loess Plateau. Through simulation runs, this model enables a better understanding of erosion-productivity-time relationships. Although relatively simple, the model successfully encompasses the processes of greatest significance to agricultural development in this part of China. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB In order to determine the effect of land use on forest floor and soil, two adjacent sites with different land use were investigated in Gallura (northern Sardinia, Italy). One site is a Quercus suber L. forest mainly used for cork production and the other is an open Quercus suber L. forest where livestock is put out to graze. In each site one soil profile was studied to characterize the mineral soil, and five humus profiles were opened along a vegetation transect, were studied to characterize the forest floor. Samples of L, F and H horizons of the forest floor and of the. A mineral horizons were collected and analysed for each profile. In the site mainly used for cork production well-developed ectorganic (L, F and H) horizons are always present, with a total thickness ranging from 5.2 to 9.5 cm. Humus profile is of the Moder type, while mineral soils have an A-C profile, generally 50 cm deep. Organic matter content in the forest floor ranges from 1.76-3.72 kg m(-2) and nutrients content in the mineral soil is high. In the site used chiefly for grazing the ectorganic horizons are very poorly developed, with a total thickness ranging from 1-3 cm, except for some islands under the Quercus suber L. canopy where the total thickness may reach 5.3 cm. Humus profile is of the Mull type, but the used classification system seems not appropriate when the tree density is below a critical limit. Mineral soils have an A-C profile 20-25 cm deep. The organic matter content in the forest floor ranges from 0.45 to 1.84 kg m(-2), while nutrient content in the mineral soil maintains at high level, even higher than in the former case for C, N and Ca, probably in relation with higher supply of cattle excreta. Sheet erosion is evident in the site. It is concluded that cork production will maintain a sustainable forest floor development in cork-oak forest ecosystem, whereas cattle grazing, fires and ploughing in cork-oak forests may be considered to trigger off severe soil degradation processes.

AB We examine some of the main forms of stakeholder participation in fisheries management, present a New Zealand case study which tests some precepts about fishery management, examine some of the tradeoffs associated with these different approaches, and finally we consider what formats stakeholder involvement might evolve to. Our particular focus is on a test of the commercial stakeholder self-management model. It is concluded that the commercial model, as applied in New Zealand, has much potential to contribute to sustainable fisheries management. Rather than competing with the quota management system and individual transferable quotas, it is an essential and complementary management tool. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Marine aquaculture in the United States: A review of current and future
   policy and management challenges
SO MARINE TECHNOLOGY SOCIETY JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB Aquaculture in the United States has the potential to become a major growth industry in the 21st Century. However, a number of issues continue to constrain the development of marine aquaculture in the United States. The complex and diverse nature of the industry, conflicts with other more traditional uses of the nation's coastal and ocean waters, environmental concerns, and the existing legal and regulatory climate all contribute to this situation. If the domestic marine aquaculture industry is to succeed and grow in the future, these issues must be resolved. First, the United States must reevaluate and reaffirm the nation's aquaculture policy. Second, the country must support sustainable marine aquaculture. Marine aquaculture in coastal and offshore waters of the United States must be developed with an eye toward sustainability-with a goal of producing products while conserving natural resources. Third, assuming the United States is truly committed to the development of the marine aquaculture industry, mechanisms must be put into place to refine existing measures and establish new implementation measures to guide its growth. The key to the future of marine aquaculture in the United State is the creation of technological and policy systems that provide for sustainable marine aquaculture. Systems that will move the industry forward will require an unequivocal commitment by the nation's political leadership to create them, by the federal bureaucracy to implement them, by the academic community to generate and extend information to improve them, and by the industry to put them into practice.

AB Microsatellite DNA markers from 13 simple sequence repeat (SSR) loci were used to compare genetic diversity between preharvest pristine and postharvest residual gene pools of two adjacent virgin, old-growth (approximate to 250 years) stands of eastern white pine (Pinus strobus L.) in Ontario. There was concurrence in genetic diversity changes in the postharvest gene pools of the two stands. The total and mean numbers of alleles detected in each stand were reduced by approximate to 26% after tree density reductions of approximate to 75%. Approximately 18 and 21% of the low-frequency (0.25 > P greater than or equal to 0.01) alleles and 76 and 92% of the rare (P < 0.01) alleles were lost from residual stands A and B, respectively, after harvesting. Multilocus gametic diversity was reduced by 38 and 85% and genotype additivity by approximate to 50% in the residual stands after harvesting. Latent genetic potential of each stand was reduced by approximate to 40%. Although heterozygosity was reduced (1-5%) in the postharvest residual stands, the reductions were not substantial and not comparable to those using other genetic diversity measures. The reductions in genetic diversity measures were slightly higher than those theoretically expected in postbottleneck populations according to drift theory. In the absence of substantial gene migration that could ameliorate the genetic losses, the ability of the postharvest white pine gene pools to adapt to changing environmental and disease conditions may have been compromised. The microsatellite DNA results for genetic effects of harvesting in old-growth eastern white pine stands were similar to those that we reported earlier from allozyme analysis (Buchert et al. 1997). The results indicate that silvicultural practices should ensure that the gene pools of remaining pristine old-growth stands are reconstituted in the regenerating stands.

AB This study reviews the challenges of managing the scarce water resources of Mexico's El Pinacate and Gran Desierto de Altar federal reserve in northwestern Sonora, Mexico. El Pinacate is a unique natural area and habitat to a number of plant and animal species, including the endangered Desert Pupfish. The El Pinacate-Gran Desierto de Altar reserve was established in 1993 with the joint purpose of preserving this extraordinary ecosystem while taking into account the sustainable development needs of those communities located within the reserve's confines. A defining feature of the El Pinacate-Gran Desierto de Altar reserve is the lack of perennial water sources. A portion of the Rio Sonoyta is the only reliable year round water source within the reserve and is supplemented by naturally occurring rock tanks and catchments that are replenished by occasional rains and may contain water year-round depending oil precipitation patterns. These few permanent water sources have historically determined the pattern of human settlement and remain vital for the small communities located in or near the reserve. Ranching and mono-crop agriculture are the principal sources of human livelihood.
   Water use on the Rio Sonoyta has binational implications. Yet, despite the existence of an international groundwater agreement between Mexico and the United States, no specific agreement has been struck on groundwater conservation for the Rio Sonoyta. Intensive water uses in the region can be dated to the introduction of wells on the Rio Sonoyta in 1952. Groundwater development was encouraged by the Mexican government in order to develop farming and ranching opportunities in the area. By 1983, as many as 290 wells were recorded in the region with a total pumping capacity of 23,203 gpm. The number of wells in use subsequently declined, totaling 120 in 1993. Since the reserve's establishment, the government has placed a moratorium on new well development, but documented annual withdrawals are still 2.5 times the annual recharge rate. Upstream water development on the Rio Sonoyta beyond the reserve perimeter has diminished well-water supplies of small in-reserve settlements, provoking downstream diversions that adversely affect rare aquatic species such as the Desert Pupfish. Declining wafer stocks may also affect other animal species, but this has yet to be scientifically demonstrated.
   As the problems of water development on the Rio Sonoyta affect the El Pinacate-Gran Desierto de Altar reserve they fake on all international dimension. The Rio Sonoyta crosses the boundary and is utilized by both countries. There is, thus, an urgent need for a binational agreement that would help conserve the river's wafer resources for the sustainable development of human communities and the preservation oft he region's fauna and flora. Unfortunately, current binational initiatives, such as the Border XXI Program, while advancing the goal of sustainable development of borderland natural resources, fail to identify the Rio Sonoyta as one of the transboundary rivers and st reams warranting binational attention. The conservation of the Reserve's water resources call be accomplished, however, if the provisions of the Reserve Decree of 1993, recent revisions to the National Water Law, and the objectives of the Border XXI Program are taken into account. Additional measures should be taken, however, including clarifying the water rights and responsibilities of current users, regularizing the water supply within the reserve as provided for in the National Water Law, developing monitoring and management plans for the various water sources within the Reserve, developing and implementing public education programs on water conservation within the region, developing a joint management plan between El Pinacate and Organ Pipe National Monument in Arizona, and, ultimately, realizing a ground water treaty between the two countries that has the aim of conserving and managing the Rio Sonoyta's water resources.

AB Analyses of the <2 mm soil fractions for S, P, pH, Al, and exchangeable cations were made to 40 cm depth 10 years after commencement of two grazed multiple pasture species mixture trials on a Tekapo/Pukaki high country soil. One trial was 30 combinations of 5 superphosphate rates (0-500 kg ha(-1) yr(-1)) x 3 stocking rates x 2 stocking methods, and the other used 27 combinations of P and S fertiliser (0-100 kg ha(-1) yr (1)). Olsen and inorganic P of topsoil increased with increasing P fertiliser rate, and was independent of S fertiliser rate. High levels of P (800 1200 ppm) in subsoil following sample ignition were interpreted as being release from humic complexes rather than organic P. There was an increase in extractable Al. Elemental S was the main S fertiliser used. Sulphate concentrations increased in all soil layers with increasing S fertiliser, and increased slightly with P fertiliser rates. There were high rates of residual elemental S (0 800 ppm). There were large increases in extractable Al and a decrease in soil pH below 5 cm with increasing S fertiliser rates. The pH decrease was attributed to oxidation of elemental S and legume N fixation. Grazing management treatments had small effects on soil inorganic components. The pasture development options were sustainable considering soil nutrient concentrations, except perhaps for increasing extractable Al and decreasing subsoil Ca and pH.

AB The Ndebele people of western Zimbabwe uphold some beliefs and practices relating to birds and these are either shared with other ethnic groups or unique to them. Some areas of interaction include the naming of birds, taboos. folk stories and songs as well as food and medicine. The changes in the lifestyle of the Ndebele resulting from industrialisation and urbanisation have had corresponding effects on attitudes towards cultural beliefs and this is affecting birdlife and indeed all biodiversity. It is suggested that where possible those beliefs and practices that impact positively on birdlife be identified and promoted for purposes of conservation and sustainable utilisation.

AB The Albertine Rift biogeographical region is recognised for its importance in biodiversity and as a centre of refugium for different taxa and birds in particular. However, the region faces important problems especially the lack of scientific knowledge, high human pressure and limited environmental education to promote awareness by the local population. This paper highlights the importance of a participatory approach to conduct research and to integrate the local population in the sustainable use of natural resources, using birds as a model. This approach was undertaken by Programme OBICO Rift Albertin (the Organisation for Biodiversity Information and Conservation in the Albertine Rift, now called "Albertine Rift Conservation Society (ARCOS)").

AB The ornithological importance of the Hadejia-Nguru wetlands at both national and international levels is well known. Current efforts at conserving the avifauna of the wetlands started with the establishment of the Hadejia-Nguru Wetlands Conservation Project (HNWCP) in 1987, as a joint international initiative to promote sustainable use of this hydric ecosystem in the otherwise semi-arid zone of north-eastern Nigeria. The present phase of the project started in 1995 with the major goal of maintaining the natural resources and function of the wetlands. This paper discusses recent activities of the project that have been directed towards conserving the wetlands, particularly its avifauna.
   Bird monitoring and the annual dry season (northern winter) waterbird surveys remain the most publicised bird conservation effort of the HNWCP. However. recognition of the vital and central rule of water in maintaining the ecological health of the wetlands has prompted the project to evolve a new strategy of regular meetings of the wetlands' water stakeholders (ragged "water-use advocacy"), to resolve periodic water-shortage and distribution problems.
   Uncontrolled hunting of birds and habitat loss remain pressing problems throughout the wetland. The HNWCP has made efforts to curb these problems by sensitising the local communities through awareness campaigns and harnessing the efforts of concerned local and national organisations. However, the HNWCP has had difficult experiences regarding the problems of crop damage by avian pests from the wetlands.

AB BirdLife International has worked for ten years in Cameroon's North-West Province to assist the local people and government of Cameroon in achieving the conservation and sustainable management of the last significant remnant of a unique montane forest ecosystem. The Kilum/Ijim forests are almost certainly the last remaining habitat for the conservation of two endemic and threatened bird species, Bannerman's Turaco Tauraco bannermani and Banded Wattle-eye Platystiera lacticincta. The forests have no legal designation as formal protected areas but have been conserved through local concern and knowledge of the multiple values of an intact forest ecosystem, backed up by the enforcement of traditional regulations, and support from the project to finding solutions to peoples' land use and natural resource management needs within and outside the forests. The project is now working under the umbrella of a national Biodiversity Conservation and Management Programme in Cameroon, funded by the Global Environment Facility, to establish the Kilum/Ijim as the first community-managed forest in the country A brief history and background to the project is presented, with emphasis on lessons learned by BirdLife and the success of current efforts to achieve the conservation of the forests through community management. The issues are discussed in the general context of an integrated conservation and development programme (ICDP).

AB Forest trees Live in enforced symbiosis with specialized fungi that form composite organs (ectomycorrhizas) with fine roots. This paper examines how this association contributes to the water status of trees and how it plays a major role in the protection mechanisms by which trees and forest stands resist drought-induced water stress. It shows how ectomycorrhizal symbiosis has both direct effects (at the uptake level) and indirect effects (at the regulation level) on the water status of trees. The facts presented are discussed in terms of forest adaptation to changing environmental conditions and the practical consequences for the sustainable management of forest ecosystems.

The functions of some packaging materials, such as prevention of food contamination protection against spoilage, preservation of contents ann communications linking the food manufacturer to the customer, are many and varied in extent ann complexity. The current life cycle assessment (LCA) can not easily be applied to the assessment of environmental impacts of packaging materials, taking packaging functions into consideration, but attempts at such application are being made experimentally.

TI The management of gravel extraction in alluvial rivers: A case study

SO PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY
LA English
DT Article
DE natural resource management; river management; gravel extraction
ID CALIFORNIA
AB A case study of the Avon River in Gippsland, southeastern Australia, demonstrates the impacts of commercial sand and gravel extraction from alluvial rivers. The Avon River has a long history of channel instability related in part to its recent change of course by avulsion and in part to destabilization driven by human activities in the channel. Con tributing to this destabilization has been the extraction of gravel, which occurred over most of the past century and, in recent years, at a rate of at least 50,000 m(3)/yr. Analyses of the gravel and the material comprising the banks of the river indicate that the gravel is being replenished from bank erosion rather than from supply from the catchment. Catchment supply is estimated to be only 5000 m(3)/yr. While this estimate of the annual bedload transport rate may be useful for indicating that gravel extraction rates are not sustainable, it cannot be assumed that extraction at the annual bedload transport rate will result in minimal impact on an alluvial river such as the Avon. Both past and present legislation has allowed management and monitoring of gravel extraction. However, in practice, the ways in which government agencies have applied the legislation have led to largely uncontrolled gravel mining primarily because of a lack of political determination to enforce the regulations, It is concluded that responsibility for the management of gravel extraction should be in the hands of the agency with direct responsibility for management of the river, and that extraction should be allowed only where it is necessary to fulfil management objectives for the river and not for routine resource access.

More than 100 transformed plants from independent transformation events were obtained for each coffee genotype. The integration and expression of the cry1Ac gene was studied, and effective resistance of transgenic plants against leaf miner was verified in bioassays with the insects. These plants could represent a good opportunity to analyse the impact of genetic engineering of perennial crops for sustainable resistance to an obligate endocarpic pest using a B. thuringiensis insecticidal protein.

AB Toward what kind of future is humankind now tending? Is human society engaged in a global gamble based on the assumption that technology, aided by human ingenuity and creativity, can remake the world and manage its resources for immediate material benefit to humanity without regard to natural law and the fate of other species? Infinite substitutability of species has been tested over evolutionary time, but infinite substitutability of resources is a relatively recent hypothesis based on a faith in human creativity and technological prowess. The choice made will affect both the future of human society and of many other species.

AB We develop and use a simulation model that considers sustainability on several levels by calculating production, consumption, investment, population growth/change, and environmental pollution less environmental quality upgrading investment. Our model allows us to consider population's impact on per capita consumption as well as the social interdependencies among population, per capita consumption, and technology. Under certain population growth scenarios we find some countries ultimately consume less pollution, and less pollution is consumed on a system-wide basis. We arrive at this apparently counterintuitive result because: (1) we explicitly model the decision to invest in environmental quality upgrading; and (2) we consider the impact of population age structure on investment, not only the impact of total population and population growth on total consumption.

TI Potential of using existing injury information for injury surveillance
   at the local level in developing countries: experiences from Bangladesh
SO PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
DE injury; surveillance; developing countries; Bangladesh
ID COMMUNITY
AB Although injury is a major public health problem in Bangladesh, as in other low income countries in the world, it has gained very little attention from policy makers, or even health professionals, mainly due to the lack of valid injury information in these countries. To address the injury problem, there is an urgent need to develop injury surveillance activities, based on existing sources of potential interest for obtaining injury information. This study is an evaluation of existing injury data sources in terms of prevention orientation representativeness. and sustainability with respect to the use of these sources in injury surveillance at the local level in Bangladesh. The regular injury information sources that have been used in this study include hospital records, post-mortem reports, newspaper reports, and police reports. In addition, 60 health practitioners in the area, representing various categories, were interviewed according to questionnaire, and ten others were interviewed in-depth about their opinions regarding their participation in the injury surveillance system. The information sources were then assessed for their potential to be included in the surveillance system. The validity was estimated by means of comparisons of the different sources.
   All the existing sources of injury information suffer from certain deficiencies such as, lack of representativeness, low prevention orientation and poor sustainability. Post-mortem reports and police reports have been found to be potential sources of mortality data but not morbidity data. Hospital records can be seen as potential sustainable sources of injury morbidity data but suffer fr om low prevention orientation and representativeness. The injury information was not consistent from source to source and failed to depict the true picture of injury in the area.
   To develop an injury surveillance system, a combination of data obtained from several different sources is necessary to compensate for inadequacies in the individual sources and to improve the overall usefulness of the system. Updated with E-codes? hospital discharge records could be used for injury morbidity surveillance, and updated police and postmortem data can be used for mortality data in injury surveillance systems at the local level in developing countries.

TI Healthy communities must also be sustainable communities
SO PUBLIC HEALTH REPORTS

DT Article
AB The author contends that healthy communities must be both environmentally and socially sustainable, given that health depends on the quality of the built and natural environments, and that global change resulting from the industrial economy is affecting the web of life. He argues that suburban sprawl wastes scarce resources and disproportionately places those resources in the hands of suburban dwellers. Urban areas can be made more environmentally sustainable, especially with respect to energy consumption, which will help reduce air pollution and climate change and contribute in other ways to improved health.

   last 100 years using cartographic data

   riverine resources

AB Gross channel changes for the Durance were determined using topographic maps from the 1890s and 1980s. Various width parameters were measured at 1 km intervals over 189 km from the Rhone junction at Avignon to La Saulce, some 31 km downstream of the dam at Serre Poncon. During this period channel size has been considerably reduced. This can be attributed to four factors, two natural and two human induced. Firstly, there was a reduction in effective runoff at the end of the Little Ice Age (late 19th century). Secondly, runoff was further reduced with lower precipitation after about 1940. Thirdly, channel widths have been reduced by bank protection and by flood mitigation works. Finally, large-scale river regulation by EDF (Electricite de France), completed in the early 1960s, includes large dams to store alpine runoff, concrete canals to convey released water through some 20 power stations, and barrages to intercept tributary runoff and divert flows into the canals. In the lower Mediterranean part of the river, some of the diverted waters are discharged into irrigation and urban water canals (about 114 m(3) s(-1)) and the rest into the Etang de Berre. Only about 1% of the mean discharge now reaches the Rhone. Discussion of available research provides insight into the four impacts, including additional comparative post-regulatory evidence from the Syndicat Mixte, a group concerned with environmental problems in the lower river. Evidence for channel change in lower parts of tributaries and for bed incision was found to be less conclusive. Such impacts may have been reduced by the interruptions of long-profile continuity by barrages and dams, and by lower discharges. Such discontinuities have adversely affected the ecology, low environmental flows and treated sewage dispersion. With some exceptions, environmental sustainability has not been a major issue because the Durance is such an important economic resource in terms of power, urban and irrigation waters, and building materials.

AB Communities are the foundation of our society and of our overall well-being. Unfortunately they are experiencing rapid transformations that may significantly erode their capacity to remain viable and sustainable both domestically and internationally. Issues of empowering communities are examined in regard to social justice, challenges to democracy and globalization of the economy and other sectors of society. It is argued that the ways in which we view and structure work, generate and disseminate knowledge through science and technology, and produce, distribute, and consume-food are essential factors affecting our self-identity and the empowerment of our communities. How we shape decisions and actions around work, science and technology, and food, as well as other key factors affecting our communities, is crucial to achieving a just and sustainable agenda for the future. Finally, it is proposed that all citizens be engaged in a procedural process called discourse ethics, which is guided by the principles of justice, recognition, respect, and accountability.

AB How is the concept of sustainable development represented in major U.S. newspapers? Are academic and activists' critiques part of the media message ? Using a systematic qualitative analysis, the author examines the themes and sources of newspaper articles from 1987 to 1997. Sustainable development is presented almost exclusively within an economic growth paradigm that assumes that economic growth, technology and northern expertise are the most effective way to achieve development. The activists and academics that are used as sources do not present alternatives to the dominant development discourse. Instead, the few alternatives that are presented are by the authors of commentaries who are not identified with environmental activist groups.

ID TREATMENT-SEEKING BEHAVIOR; COST
AB Early diagnosis and treatment of malaria cases is one of the basic elements of the current global malaria control strategy. In order to provide this service to people in rural areas there is a need for new cost-effective approaches. To ensure that such new approaches are acceptable to the target communities, it is important to know the rationale for people's malaria treatment-seeking behavior. The present study provides insights into the reasons for people's preferences for different types of healthcare facilities and describes variation of these preferences within a rural community in Sri Lanka. The study reports on the experiences with the establishment of a village health facility and its effect on the treatment-seeking behavior of the population. After the introduction of the village treatment center it quickly took over the role of main provider for diagnosis and treatment of malaria from the government facilities. The treatment center did not improve the response time in seeking treatment for young children, but the delay for adults was reduced by 1-2 days. Mothers with small children often preferred the government facilities since they wanted a more qualified opinion than available from the locally recruited staff of the village treatment center. The treatment center significantly reduced the stress and discomfort experienced by the elderly and handicapped segment of the community. The study indicated that the effective catchment area of a village treatment center will be influenced by the degree of initial support from key individuals in the communities, the selection procedure and training of assistants, and the history of the relationships between different villages to be served by the center, The government health services and communities across the dry zone of Sri Lanka could benefit substantially from the establishment of more village treatment centers. To ensure the long-term sustainability of these type of facilities it is necessary to assess the feasibility of charging a user fee and establishing multi-purpose clinics. Government policies and administrative procedures will need to be adjusted to make the successful operation of village treatment centers possible. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The number of growing seasons required for no-till practices to improve soil properties should be considered before changing management systems. To evaluate this time factor, an 8-yr tillage study was conducted on a Grenada silt loam (fine-silty, mixed, active, thermic Glossic Fragiudalfs) using cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.), grain sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench]-corn (Zea mays L.), and soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.]-wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) as test crops. Soil samples were characterized for soil organic matter (SOM), pH, exchangeable Ca and Mg, extractable P, K, Pe, Mn, Cu, and Zn, aggregate stability (AS), water dispersible clay (WDC), total clay (TC), and modulus of rupture (MR) at time 0, 4, and 8 yr. Within 4 yr, net-till (NT) resulted in statistically significant (P less than or equal to 0.05) differences compared to conventional tillage (CT). The surface 2.5 cm of the NT treatments had higher levels of SOM, exchangeable Ca, and extractable P, Mn, and Zn, but lower extractable K, Fe, and Cu. Tillage had no effect on exchangeable Mg and pH. No-till also resulted in higher AS, and lower MR, WDC, and TC in the top 2.5 cm, relative to CT The differences in soil properties between tillage treatments were essentially independent of crop. Instead, the results are controlled by relative amounts of SOM and clay, and the extent to which these properties change with time. Undoubtedly, NT practices ran improve several fertility and erodibility-related properties of this soil within 4:yr, and-enhance its sustainability.

AB Annual monitoring of water-budget components is useful for comparing the fate of water inputs among ecosystems. Land-use changes from natural prairies to managed agroecosystems alter water-budget components. Weekly hydrological budgets for a restored natural prairie and maize (Zen mays L,) agroecosystems (no-tillage and chisel-plow) were constructed for 132 consecutive wk between June 1995 and January 1998. Precipitation, drainage, soil water-storage changes, and snow-cover changes were measured on Piano silt loam soil (fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Argiudoll) at agricultural and prairie sites. Compared with the maize ecosystems, the prairie maintained greater soil water contents deeper in the soil profile (0.8-1.4 m), somewhat larger evapotranspiration (Et), and significantly less drainage because of considerable interception of precipitation by a residue layer. Soil water storage in the no-tillage maize setting was more similar to the prairie, while Et, net primary productivity, and drainage were more comparable to the chisel-plow agroecosystem. Total drainage measured with equilibrium-tension lysimeters was 199 mm of water (coefficient of variation [CV] = 5.7%) for the prairie ecosystem, 563 mm of water (CV = 13.6%) for the no-tillage maize ecosystem, and 793 mm of water (CV = 18.5%) for the chisel-plow maize ecosystem. Residue interception for the prairie was 477 mm, compared with 681 mm of precipitation during the growing season of 1997, which contributed to lower prairie drainage. The combination of similar productivity, higher soil water contents, and less drainage than the chisel-plow ecosystem suggests that a no-tillage ecosystem is more sustainable than the chisel-plow agroecosystem in terms of reducing potential adverse environmental impacts associated with soil water movement.

AB Farming activities practiced on many Australian soils have resulted in substantial losses of soil organic matter (SOM), nutrient loss, soil structural degradation and declines in cereal yield and quality. Field trials, consisting of a legume or fallow phase followed by three wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) crops,were established on a degraded Ferric Luvisol (Red Earth) soil in New South Wales to investigate the effect of crop residue and fertiliser management on wheat yield and nutrient balances. There were no effects of a chickpea (Cicer arietinum L. cv Amethyst), barrel medic (Medicago truncatula L. cv Sephi), or fallow phase on the grain yields of three subsequent wheat crops. Grain yield was depressed by 12% following a lucerne (Medicago sativa L. cv Trifecta) crop from which the plant residues had been removed, relative to when residues were returned or grazed. Consecutively, higher wheat grain yield losses of 7.4 and 8.6% in 1994 and 1995 were found on treatments from which wheat stubble was annually removed from the system. Grain yield losses of 6, 7 and 13% in three consecutive wheat crops were found where no fertiliser was applied at sowing. Nutrient balances, based on inputs of nutrients in fertilisers and residues, and the export of nutrients in grain and crop residue were found to be useful in describing the flow of nutrients in a farming system and predicting possible soil nutrient depletion. Fallow systems provide no nutrient inputs and result in N losses of up to -189 kg ha(-1) over three wheat crops. The balance of nutrients such as potassium (K), which are contained in larger proportions in stubble, were found to be -102 kg ha(-1) on the wheat stubble removed treatments and +8 kg ha(-1) on the stubble retained treatments. Better recycling of crop residues and improving ley system to increase nutrient and C inputs have the potential to improve soil fertility and grain production. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Soil organic matter (SOM) is considered as a key indicator of sustainability, therefore measurements of SOM changes under various forms of management are needed for the development of sustainable systems. Because the measurement of total SOM is not sensitive enough to monitor short and medium term changes, techniques that measure meaningful fractions of SOM should be used. In this study both total carbon (CT) measured by combustion and labile carbon (CL) determined by oxidation with 333 mM potassium permanganate (KMnO4) were measured. Field trials, consisting of a legume phase followed by three wheat (Triticum aestivum L. cv. Janz) crops, were established on a degraded Ferric Luvisol (Red Earth) soil in New South Wales to investigate the effect of crop residue and fertiliser management on wheat yield, soil physical properties and SOM, Total and labile C increased following a lucerne (Medicago sativa L. cv. Trifecta) phase, however, chickpea (Cicer arietinum L. cv. Amethyst), barrel medic (Medicago truncatula L. cv. Sephi) and fallow leys resulted in no increases in soil C concentrations. During the wheat phase the concentration of CL significantly increased on the treatments with wheat stubble retention. This resulted in the C Management Index (CMI), an index comparing changes in labile and total C fractions relative to an uncropped reference soil, increasing from 19 to 27. The greatest treatment effect on soil physical properties was the retention of wheat stubble on the soil surface over the summer fallow period which increased hydraulic conductivity (K) by more than 65%, relative to the stubble removed treatment. Mean weight diameter (MWD) increased from 799 to 920 mu m and a significant relationship was found between hydraulic conductivity and water stable aggregates >500 mu m. Soil strength at 15 cm decreased from 2713 in the non-return to 2064 kPa in the stubble retained treatments with both treatments having a similar water content at the time of measurement. Although legume species are widely used as a rotation phase, their use in combination with cereal stubble retention is more likely to improve the overall fertility of the farming system.

AB Soil organic matter decline and associated degradation of soil and environmental conditions under conventional tillage in tropical and subtropical regions underline the need to develop sustainable soil management systems. This study aimed first to evaluate the long-term effect (9 years) of two soil-tillage systems (conventional tillage: CT, and no-tillage: NT) and two cropping systems (oat (Avena strigosa Schreb)/maize (Zea mays L.): O/M; and oat+common vetch (Vicia sativa L.)/ maize+cowpea (Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp): O+V/M+C without N fertilization on total organic carbon (TOC) and total nitrogen (TN) concentrations in a sandy clay loam Acrisol in southern Brazil. The second objective was to assess soil potential for acting as an atmospheric CO2 sink. Under NT an increase of soil TOC and TN concentrations occurred, in both cropping systems, when compared with CT. However, this increase was restricted to soil surface layers and it was higher for O+V/M+C than for O/M, The O+V/M+C under NT, which probably results in the lowest soil organic matter losses (due to erosion and oxidation) and highest addition of crop residues, had 12 Mg ha(-1) more TOC and 0.9 Mg ha(-1) more TN in the 0-30.0 cm depth soil layer, compared with O/M under CT which exhibits highest soil organic matter losses and lowest crop residue additions to the soil. These increments represent TOC and TN accumulation rates of 1.33 and 0.10 Mg ha(-1) per year, respectively. Compared with CT and O/M, this TOC increase under NT and O+V/M+C means a net carbon dioxide removal of about 44 Mg ha(-1) from the atmosphere in 9 years. NT can therefore be considered, as it is in temperate climates, an important management strategy for increasing soil organic matter. In the tropicals and subtropicals, where climatic conditions cause intense biological activity, in order to maintain or increase soil organic matter, improve soil quality and contribute to mitigation of CO2 emissions, NT should be associated with cropping systems resulting in high annual crop residue additions to soil surface.

AB Managing tropical rain forests is difficult because few long-term field data on forest growth and the impact of harvesting disturbance are available. Growth models may provide a valuable tool for managers of tropical forests, particularly if applied to the extended forest areas of up to 100,000 ha that typically constitute the so-called forest management units (FMUs). We used a stand growth model in a geographic information system (GIS) environment to simulate tropical rain forest growth at the FMU level.
   We applied the process-based rain forest growth model Formix 3-Q to the 55,000 ha Deramakot Forest Reserve (DFR) in Sabah, Malaysia. The FMU was considered to be composed of single and independent small-scale stands differing in site conditions and forest structure. Field data, which were analyzed with a GIS, comprised a terrestrial forest inventory, site and soil analyses (water, nutrients, slope), the interpretation of aerial photographs of the present vegetation and topographic maps. Different stand types were determined based on a classification of site quality (three classes), slopes (four classes), and present forest structure (four strata). The effects of site quality on tree allometry (height-diameter curve, biomass allometry, leaf area) and growth (increment size) are incorporated into Formix 3-Q. We derived allometric relations and growth factors for different site conditions from the field data. Climax forest structure at the stand level was shown to depend strongly on site conditions. Simulated successional pattern and climax structure were compared with field observations. Based on the current management plan for the DFR, harvesting scenarios were simulated for stands on different sites. The effects of harvesting guidelines on forest structure and the implications for sustainable forest management at Deramakot were analyzed. Based on the stand types and GIS analysis, we also simulated undisturbed regeneration of the logged-over forest in the DFR at the FMU level. The simulations predict slow recovery rates, and regeneration times far exceeding 100 years.

AB Defining and measuring sustainability is a major challenge. This article argues these limitations need not stop us from trying to identify and value the possible impacts of what we are doing, or are thinking about doing, over time periods much longer than the lives of our investments, or even of the lives of those of us living today. Sustainability is a relative concept that must be applied in an environment undergoing multiple changes, changes that are occurring over different temporal and spatial scales. We depend on our water resource systems for our survival and welfare. Yet no one expects them to be restored to, or survive in, their most productive pristine states in the face of increasing development pressures for land in their watersheds and for water in their streams, rivers, fakes, and aquifers. A continuing task of water resource planners and managers is to identify the multiple impacts and tradeoffs resulting fi-om what we who are living today may wish to do for ourselves and our immediate children and what we can only guess our yet-to-be-born descendants may wish us to do, or not do, for them in some distant future. This task must involve professionals from other disciplines in a context much broader than just water management. Once these impacts and tradeoffs are identified, it is then up to the political process to make choices when they are in conflict. All of us need to be a part of this decision-making process.

AB The use of water for food production accounts for about 75 percent of the total withdrawal in developing countries and is crucial for sustenance. It is also important for addressing poverty and rural development. With developing countries endeavoring to enter the mainstream of development, a formidable challenge in water resources development, resource use efficiency and environmental conservation is faced by these countries, in which management of water for food will continue to remain prominent. A review of the current state of the sector in the developing countries is presented with a brief case study in India for realism. It is clear that although considerable development in the area has occurred, there are serious policy, engineering, environmental and management deficiencies. Approaches for modernisation of the sector are suggested in terms of quantum change in concepts, policies, planning approaches, institutions. and attitudes. Approaches for implementation are proposed.

AB Floods, droughts, water scarcity, and water contamination are some among many water problems that are present today and will be even more noticeable in the future. In the past, many different tools have been used for simulation and optimization of complex water resources systems in order to provide an improved basis for decision making. The continuing evolution of information technology (hardware and software) creates a good environment for the transition to new tools. Application of the systems approach to water resources planning, management, and operations has been established as one of the most important advances mane in the field of water resources engineering. Based on the lessons learned, this contribution provides my personal view on the tools to be used in the future. Two paradigm shifts are discussed The first one is focusing on the complexity of the water resources domain and the complexity of the modelling tools in an environment characterised by continuous rapid technological development. The second one deals with water-related data availability and natural variability of domain variables in time and space affecting the uncertainty of water resources decision making.

   sustainable development; long-term forecasts; decision support
AB Presently a change of paradigm in the field of planning and operation of water management schemes can be observed The introduction of the principle of sustainable development by the United Nations and the principle of integrated river basin management postulated by the European Union play a major role in this context, introduction of these new principles requires development of new planning tools, which in turn require a much better data basis than available hitherto, This paper deals with new data types already partly available now, partly to be expected to be developed in the medium-range future. The present data situation is discussed, along with the obvious deficits of conventional data. New data types will not be limited to point measurements, but rather must comprise information covering large areas with a higher resolution in time and space than presently available. Remote sensing data will play a more important role in the future. Furthermore, digital maps, digital elevation models, etc. are also of growing importance and will be processed together with remote sensing and other data, within Geographical Information Systems of future generations also exposing the potential for working with multi-temporal imagery. In the paper it is shown that in the future more accurate data will be available, not only in terms of data quality, but also resolution in time and space. It is shown how the new types of hydrometeorological data postulate new types of hydrological models. Here, distributed system models are of growing importance. Furthermore, it is shown how the combination of remote sensing with other information leads to new data types that allow integrated planning of water resources systems. The potential of real time data is highlighted, particularly in the context of real time operation of water resources systems, especially for flood control. The potential of large-scale data schemes in the context of regional and continental water management schemes is discussed Global atmospheric models coupled to hydrological models are discussed, and their potential to consider long-distance effects of certain phenomena (e.g., El Nino) are mentioned. For sustainable development of water resources, the potential of long-term data prediction scenarios is evaluated and an example of this principle for planning future water supply systems is presented. The paper ends with a vision of future developments in planning water management schemes on the basis of new data types.

AB As the world approaches the 30-year anniversary of the Stockholm Conference on the Human Environment and prepares to review progress made in the decade since Dublin and Rio, we are confronted with results that are mostly disappointing. When it comes to addressing the water resources crisis, the 1990s may well be remembered as a decade of debate rather than action. Recent assessments suggest a doubling to almost two-thirds of the world's population experiencing some water stress by 2025 and increased demands to withdraw move water for a new "green revolution" for irrigated agriculture. Both of these will accelerate environmental degradation to a new crisis level while the existing degradation that resulted from the first "green revolution" still awaits remedial action both in the North as well as in the South. It is now clear that the global water crisis and the global environment crisis are linked and are being exacerbated by unprecedented global pressure resulting from over-consumption, population growth, globalization of economic systems and trade, reduction in development assistance, and failure to enact necessary policy, legal, and institutional reforms. This article makes the case that the traditional sector-by-sector approach to economic development is a key contributor to the two global crises. Lessons of experience are presented on policy, legal, and institutional reforms necessary to address the inter-linked crises through integrated approaches to managing land and water resources and their biological diversity. Water pricing reforms, reductions in damaging subsidies, land tenure reforms, community participation, and institutional reforms are necessary. There is a need to build upon the linkages and synergies among the three Rio conventions (climate, biodiversity, and desertification) in order to create new global driving forces for actions to address the crises holistically in the context of a country's national sustainable development strategy. The Global Environment Facility (GEF) and its implementing agencies stand ready with incremental cost grant financing to assist countries willing to undertake the reforms for integrated basin management of land water and biological resources as they transition towards sustainable development.

AB Objective To evaluate the effectiveness of an educational intervention in adolescent health designed for general practitioners, in accordance with evidence-based practice in continuing medical education. Design Randomized, controlled trial with baseline testing and 7- and 13-month follow-ups. Setting The intervention was delivered in local community settings ro general practitioners in metropolitan Melbourne, Australia. Participants A total of 108 self-selected general practitioners. Intervention A multifaceted educational program (2.5 hours per week for 6 weeks) in the principles of adolescent: health care, followed 6 weeks later by a 2-hour session of case discussion and debriefing. Outcome measures Objective ratings of videotaped consultations with st standardized adolescent patients and self-completion questionnaires were used to measure general practitioners' knowledge, skill, and self-perceived competency; satisfaction with the program; and self-reported change in practice. Results 103 of 108 physicians (95%) completed ail phases of the intervention and evaluation protocol. The intervention group showed significantly greater improvements than the control group in all outcomes at the 7-month follow-up (all subjects P<0.03), except: for the standardized patients' rating of rapport and satisfaction (P=0.12). 104 participants (96%) found the program appropriate and relevant. At the 13-month follow-up, most: improvements were sustained, the standardized patients' rating of confidentiality fell slightly, and the objective assessment of competence further improved. 106 physicians (98%) reported a change in practice attributable to the intervention. Conclusions General practitioners were willing to complete continuing medical education in adolescent health and irs evaluation. The design of the intervention, using evidence-based educational strategies, proved effective and expeditious in achieving sustainable and large improvements in knowledge, skill, and self-perceived competency.

AB The most important problems facing wildlife conservation are the growing human population and its affluence, and the concomitant requirement for resources to accommodate this growth. A pressing question is how to maintain wildlife numbers and diversity when prime wildlife habitat is needed for agriculture, resource extraction, or urban expansion. Solutions to this problem may not be forthcoming because mainstream (generally meaning neoclassical) economic logic and policies are often in direct conflict with the goals of wildlife science. There is a great need for wildlife scientists to broaden their view and sophistication of economics and also to expand the wildlife field to encompass the larger social farces that are changing the well-being of wildlife species. In what follows we elaborate on 1) what we perceive to be the underlying problem of wildlife conservation; 2) why our current system of economic valuation will, in the long term, undercut the goal of wildlife conservation; and 3) how to incorporate these concepts into wildlife curricula and the wildlife profession.

AB The meaning of sustainability is the subject of intense debate among economists. The dominant school of economics in the United States, neoclassical economics, equates human welfare with the level of consumption of market goods and sees the natural world merely as an input into the economic process. To neoclassical economists, sustainability means sustaining economic output. Ecological economists take a broader view of sustainability by recognizing that essential features of the earth's life-supporting systems also must be sustained. The sustainability debate currently focuses on the ability of the economy to substitute human-created infrastructure for the services of the environment. The neoclassical concept is called "weak" sustainability, and the ecological economics concept is called "strong" sustainability. The motivation for weak sustainability is preserving an economy's capital stock, which produces economic output. Capital stock consists of human-made or "manufactured capital," the services of the environment or "natural capital," and the level of technology and training or "human capital." Weak sustainability assumes that these kinds of capital are substitutable for one another. The motivation for strong sustainability is recognizing that substitution possibilities among these different kinds of capital are Limited. This paper discusses some of the terms and concepts behind the sustainability debate between neoclassical and ecological economics.

AB Rattlesnakes are commercially exploited to supply an international trade in skins, meal, gall bladders, and curies. Five species are used in 8 states: western diamondback rattlesnakes (Crotalus atrox) in Texas, Oklahoma, and New Mexico; eastern diamondback rattlesnakes (C. adamanteus) in Alabama, Florida, and Georgia; prairie rattlesnakes (C. viridis) in Kansas, Texas, Oklahoma, and New Mexico; and timber rattlesnakes (C. horridus) in Pennsylvania, Georgia, Alabama, and Florida. Blacktail rattlesnakes (C. molossus) occasionally appear in the trade in New Mexico and Texas. The trade is linked to rattlesnake roundups, which are economically important to local communities. We estimated that 15% of the western diamondback and eastern diamondback rattlesnakes entering the trade originate from roundups. In the 1990s, probably <125,000 rattlesnakes of all species entered the trade yearly. Analyses of long-term data from 3 rattlesnake roundups showed variable trends in rate of take, number of hunters, and pounds of snakes/hunter. Analysis of the take of western diamondback rattlesnakes from 1959 to 1997 at the roundup at Sweetwater, Texas, showed no long-term trends, but was characterized by extreme variability. Body size (snout-vent length [SVL] and mass) and sex ratios of hunted western diamondback rattlesnakes varied significantly by region and through time. These differences were probably due more to geographic and temporal variation than to the effects of hunting. Rattlesnake harvests of all species were male-biased, and a few hunters collected the majority of the take. A model of the economic impacts of imposing size restrictions on rattlesnake harvests showed that hunters earn 19% more money when restricting take to rattlesnakes >90 cm SVL (size at maturity of most females) whereas profit to the industry increased 6%. Size limits below 90 cm SVL would minimally impact total take; restricting take to rattlesnakes >90 cm SVL would reduce number of immature females by almost 50%. Rattlesnake species differ in susceptibility to overexploitation, and research on life-history variation of rattlesnakes should be an important management priority. Information also is needed on local versus regional impacts of hunting, and monitoring information is needed for the entire trade. Rattlesnakes are traded alive, and issues relating to the treatment of live rattlesnakes need to be considered when developing management plans for North American rattlesnakes.

AB Urbanisation will be one of the big issues of the new millennium. According to UN estimates, half the world's population will soon live in cities. Cities are at a cross-roads. Will they be able to capitalise on their strengths - many-layered opportunities for economic and social contact, accessible leisure and cultural facilities, dense networks - leading to an urban renaissance; or will suburbanisation intensify, becoming sprawl, because the disadvantages of city life outweigh the benefits? How can cities reconcile economic vigour with sustainability? What will be the impact of new technology? What should be the role of governance? What do cities need to do to succeed and prosper in a globally competitive world of increasingly footloose industries and individuals?

AB Being presented with the WAAVP Pfizer award for excellence in parasitological research is the pinnacle of my career. In accepting I acknowledge the support that I have received from workmates, colleagues, friends and family over the years that I have been involved in this field of endeavour. Parasitic disease is the most significant threat to the Australian sheep industry. A lack of understanding of drug action, the absence of epidemiologically-based treatment programs and incorrect or excessive chemical use has resulted in the development of worm, lice and blowfly parasites which are resistant to most existing chemotherapeutic compounds. During the past decade, difficulties in sustainable control of parasitic disease, the decline in demand for wool products and competition from less expensive synthetic fibre has halved the sheep population and profitability of the industry. Notwithstanding this, a 'right-sized', sustainable industry is emerging which will require effective chemotherapy to be the cornerstone of parasite control. Chemical intervention in parasitic disease is therefore here to stay but the paucity of new antiparasitic products in the short term dictates that present therapeutics are all that producers will have for the foreseeable future. This situation will necessitate innovative practices and formulations to provide more cost effective, efficient drug performance and to extend parasiticide life. However, the development of multiple drug resistance and reduction in funds for parasitological research seriously compromises our ability to confront these demands.
   With the patent life of all but the most recent macrocyclic lactone (ML) compounds lapsing, low cost development of bioequivalent generic formulations and options for innovative strategies to increase performance and market share are eagerly sought. The key to efficient drug use lies in a detailed understanding of the pharmacokinetic principles of drug action and the host animal's physiological responses to identify procedures which maximise drug availability - in essence giving the drug the best chance to work.

DE Italian planning; Cremona; provincial planning; sustainability
AB Sustainable landscape planning at the provincial level is explained through the example of the province of Cremona, Italy. Six topics are addressed. First, the topic of why planning in Italy, in general, and Cremona, more specifically, is important will be addressed. Cremona province is located in northern Italy, where traditionally rural regions are facing expanding urbanization. Second, a background of Italian planning is provided. A 1990 law, in particular, emphasizes provincial-level planning. Third, the history and landscape of Cremona will be described. For most of its: history, Cremona has been dominated by agriculture, which is reflected in the landscape. Fourth, the province of Cremona planning process will be summarized. The planning activity began in 1994 and continues to the present. Fifth, the design: of a sustainability index is explained. The sustainability index is used to assess how land-use modifications might affect the environment. Finally, the key lessons from the process will be noted. The Cremona provincial plan applies concepts of sustainability to a changing landscape. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB India, with a long coastline spanning over 7500 km and positioned in the central part of the Indian ocean, is one of the important regions for many developments. Oceans play an important part in the social and economic life of people in the region and hence there is growing interest to study about them. Much about the oceans still remains to be understood, largely due to lack of detailed and accurate observations, Satellite platforms have recently been demonstrating reliable and long-term observations. Data from such observations can be used together with point-based in situ data for sustainable exploration and exploitation of ocean resources and for improving the accuracy of forecast of weather conditions, ocean state and longer-term climatic changes. Significant progress has been achieved in India during the past few years in demonstrating the utility of satellite-based remote sensing data for oceanographic research and applications. As part of these efforts, techniques have been developed to retrieve and measure various ocean parameters and processes such as ocean surface waves, wind, sea surface temperature, chlorophyll pigments, oceanic eddies, heat budget, mixed layer depth and latent heat studies. In order to meet the specific and increasing data demands in ocean research, concerted efforts are being made for developing and launching state-of-the-art satellites for ocean applications. The first in the series of the ocean satellites, IRS-P4 (Oceansat-1), was launched successfully on 26 May 1999 using the indigenous Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) from Sriharikota, A well-knit plan has been initiated for the proper utilization of data from Oceansat-1 mission. This paper highlights ocean research in India as well as ocean observation missions which aim to provide operational ocean information services in the country.

AB Nature-based silviculture is a promising approach to meet the criteria for sustainable forestry, This brings the natural forest into focus as a basic reference for forest management. The present study focuses on the structural dynamics of a near-natural temperate deciduous forest in Denmark as a reference for forestry. The study was conducted in Suserup Skov (55 degrees 22'N, 11 degrees 34'E, 19.2 ha), an ancient woodland with a long history of low human impact. It is a mixed deciduous forest dominated by Fagus sylvatica L. and Fraxinus excelsior L. with some Quercus robur L, and Ulnus glabra Huds. The dynamics and structures of Suserup Skov can be described in time and space according to the mosaic-cycle concept.
   A specific model of the forest cycle in Suserup Skov was developed including five sequential phases. The typical duration of each phase was determined: innovation (14 years), aggradation (56 years), early biostatic (96 years), late biostatic (108 years) and degradation (10 years) phases, equalling some 284 years for the full cycle. In principle, the forest cycle takes place at any given patch of the forest, asynchronous from patch to patch, resulting in a shifting mosaic of the constituent phases. The mosaic, mapped in a 10.65-ha plot in 1992, had an average patch size of 839 m(2), ranging from 100 to 12 730 m(2). The patches of the shorter phases (innovation, degradation) were on average considerably smaller than the patches of the longer phases, which can be explained partly by fusion of neighbouring patches. The aggregate areas of each phase were almost directly proportional to their respective duration, suggesting that the shifting mosaic was close to the steady state. The disturbance regime and disturbance history of Suserup Skov is discussed. It is concluded that several disturbances of smaller scale had occurred during the past centuries and that the most influencing recent disturbance has been the long period of human influence by rural, woodland management (pannage, pasture and coppicing) before the enclosure of the forest in 1807. The Suserup Skov example shows that a temperate deciduous forest under a relatively calm disturbance regime can develop into a very fine-grained mosaic, apparently approaching the shifting mosaic steady state within a rather small area. The structural steady state in Suserup Skov occurs, even though the overall species composition is still under successional change. Further, 'climax microsuccession' from Fraxinus to Fagus occurs as an integral part of the forest cycle in Suserup Skov, Cyclic and directional processes are intermingled in Suserup Skov, highlighting the complex relationships between the concepts of succession and climax. The paper finally exemplifies how natural forests can be used as a reference for silviculture, nature conservation and landscape planning. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In the emerging knowledge-based global economy, the sustainable competitive advantage of nations will reside not in their possession of natural resources or cheap labour force, but in their ability to harness their countries' intellectual assets. As such, the knowledge revolution offers a unique chance to Leapfrog entire stages of development. This paper argues that in Order to make such a leap Tamil Nadu needs to initiate a knowledge-led development policy that builds on the state's successful IT industry.:This paper proposes, a roadmap to raise the global competitiveness of Tamil Nadu's IT industry, through strengthening both the demand and the supply.

AB Crop-land suitability analysis is a prerequisite to achieve optimum utilisation of the available rand resources for sustainable agricultural production. The Food and Agricultural Organisation [FAO, 1976. A framework for land evaluation (Soils Bulletin No. 32). FAO, Rome.] recommended an approach for land suitability evaluation for crops in terms of suitability ratings from highly suitable to not suitable based on climatic and terrain data and soil properties crop-wise. The assignment of a given area element (pixel) to any one suitability class is encountered with problems due to the variation of soil properties within the area as well as matching of the soil properties with more than one suitability class to different extents. The Boolean methods are designed to assign a pixel to a single class and no provision exists for assigning partial suitability to each of the appropriate suitability classes. In the present study the use of fuzzy (partial) membership classification is used to accommodate the above uncertainty in assigning the suitability classes to the pixel. The evaluation of the spatial variability of relevant terrain parameters is carried out in a geographic information system environment while assigning the land suitability for crops in the study area of Kalyanakere sub-watershed in Karnataka. Nine parameters (eight of soil and one of topography) are considered and suitability analysis is carried out by fuzzy membership classification with due weightage factors included to accommodate the relative importance of the soil parameters governing the crop productivity. According to the held information, the crop being grown in maximum area is finger millet. However, the crop-land evaluation results of the present study reveal that maximum area is potentially suitable for growing ground nut. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB To optimize the use of the available land and water resources of a watershed for sustainable agricultural production, soil erosion assessment and conservation are essential. The Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) is a widely accepted model (Wishmeier and Smith, 1965. Predicting Rainfall Erosion Losses from Cropland (Agricultural Handbook No. 282). USDA. Washington, D.C.) for assessing soil erosion and to account for the most important factors. Conventional approaches to classification are designed to assign a given area element (pixel) to a single erosion class. However, the soil and other physical parameters might vary spatially within a pixel and it may not correspond entirely to a single erosion class. To determine the loss of information on the susceptibility to erosion a fuzzy class membership approach was used to assign partial grades to the erosion classes. In the present studies, a spatially distributed approach was used to consider the influence of the spatial variation in the soil and other physical parameters in soil erosion assessment in the study area, Kalyanakere subwatershed Karnataka, India, using the USLE model. The emphasis of the studies was laid on the use of a fuzzy class membership approach in soil erosion classification, and to develop a criteria table specifying the erosion parameter values related to erosion susceptibility classes from available literature to apply fuzzy class membership approach for the classification. Salient features of the approach and the results of the study are presented in this paper. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID URINE
AB High density animal production systems, such as management intensive grazing (MIG), can have a negative effect on water quality. Learning to manage such systems to minimize water quality impacts is essential for the environmental and economic sustainability of these types of animal production systems. Management intensive grazing is a grazing system in which animals at a high stocking density are rotated through several paddocks at short time intervals (12-24 h) so that animal performance is maximized. Although MIG has the potential to increase dairy farm profitability in the northeast US, recent work in this region has shown that a substantial amount of N applied as fertilizer is leached below the root zone of orchardgrass (Dactyls glomerata L., (cv.) 'Pennlate') managed as an intensive pasture. How much N is leached from other forage species managed as intensive pasture under the climatic conditions of the northeast US is not known. A field study was conducted using large drainage lysimeters to measure NO3-N leaching loss from six pasture swards: orchardgrass + N, orchardgrass + alfalfa (Medicago sativa L., (cv.) Alfagraze), orchardgrass + Ladino type white clover (Trifolium repens L.), Ryegrass (Lolium perrene L, (cv.) Citadel) + N, ryegrass + alfalfa, and ryegrass + white clover. The study site was located in central Pennsylvania on a Hagerstown silt loam soil (fine, mixed, mesic Typic Hapludalf). Nitrate-N leaching losses were most consistent under N fertilized swards where the amount of N could be adjusted for yearly weather conditions. In a drought year, NO3-N leaching increased dramatically in swards containing alfalfa or white clover. Sward type and stocking density need to be taken into consideration when developing an animal production system that will be both environmentally and economically sustainable.

AB Effects of land-use management on agricultural sustainability and greenhouse gas emissions are major issues for researchers, regional councils and farmers in New Zealand. This study was undertaken to investigate the environmental impact of land-use management on field-CO2 emissions in Ohakea silt loam soil (Typic andoaqualf) that had been converted from permanent pasture to forage cropping for 2 years. The treatments were plow tillage (PT) and no-tillage (NT), with summer fodder maize (Zea mays L.) double-cropped in rotation with winter oat (Avena sativa L.); permanent pasture (PP) was used as control. Field-CO2 emissions measured every 3-4 weeks during 12 months, were significantly highest in the PP. Overall, results indicate that reduction in tillage had only a minor effect on field-CO2 emission throughout the crop growth period, During one year CO2 emissions ranged from 55-132 kg C ha(-1) per day in the PP treatment. 43-91 kg C ha(-1) per day in the NT treatment and 36-81 kg C ha(-1) per day in the PT treatment. Daily field-CO2 emissions measured within a few days after cultivation were significantly highest in the PP treatment and were in the order of PP > NT > PT. Conversion of PP to NT cropping had no effect on surface organic C levels, but conversion to cropping with tillage markedly reduced C levels. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In Misiones, in the northeast of Argentina, agroforestry systems of timber trees and perennial cash crops are becoming increasingly common. We evaluated the productivity of Ilex paraguariensis St Hill (South American holly or yerba mate, Aquifoliaceae) in association with indigenous trees: Enterolobium contortisiliquum (Vellozo) Morong. (timbo, Leguminosae, a N-2-fixing tree), and two timber species, Balfourodendron riedelianum (Engler) Engler (guatambu, Rutaceae) and Tabebuia heptaphylla (Vellozo) Toledo (lapacho negro, Bignoniaceae). Five years after planting, the tree species were 2.7 to 5.0 m high and 3 to 7 cm in diameter at breast height, and the yerba mate produced its first harvest. Additionally, the production of associated crops of subsistence covered the annual needs of the farmer. These systems are promising for sustainable use of deforested lands in the region.

AB With renewed interest in the use of ecologically-designed, sustainable agricultural systems for temperate regions of the world, agroforestry is being proposed as an alternative to intensive production of crops in monocultures. However, the knowledge-base for understanding and managing complex, multi-strata systems worldwide is limited, particularly so for temperate regions. We examined an alley cropping system in the midwestern US where maize (Zea mays L.) is grown in alleys between tree rows of either black walnut (Juglans nigra L.) or red oak (Quercus rubra L.). During a course of ten years, crop yields in rows adjacent to tree rows declined by 50% or more. With the experimental introduction of barriers to separate tree and crop root systems, yields in the rows near trees were equal to those of the center row (and monoculture). Irrespective of a high correlation between photosynthetically active radiation and net photosynthesis, shading did not have a major influence on crop yield. At this stage of system development (11 year old trees), influence of incident PAR on crop yield seems to be minimal. Subsequent papers in this series examine the sharing of belowground resources between trees and crops to quantify the competitive interactions that impact crop yields and their implications for economic return to the farmer.

AB A study was carried out in an alley cropping system in the Eastern Maize Belt of the United States with the objective of quantifying the competition for water between trees black walnut (Juglans nigra L.) and red oak (Quercus rubra L.) and maize (Zea mays L.). Spatial and temporal variation in soil moisture, tree and maize rooting patterns, tree and maize water uptake, and maize leaf area expansion were determined in three treatments; 'barrier' (polyethylene root barriers separating maize and tree roots), 'trench' (trenching without a polyethylene barrier), and 'no barrier' (control). Significant temporal variation in soil moisture was observed in both black walnut and red oak alley cropping systems. The 'barrier' and 'trench' treatments resulted in higher soil moisture in the 'maize alley' and lower soil moisture in the 'tree row' than the 'no barrier' treatment. Uptake of water by maize was higher in the 'barrier' than the 'no barrier' treatment. However, tree water uptake was higher in the 'no barrier' treatment than in the 'barrier' treatment because tree roots utilized water from the 'maize alley'. Maize leaf area was negatively impacted by water stress in the 'no barrier' treatment. Quantification of rooting patterns revealed that maize and tree roots were concentrated in the top 30 cm soil layer where water fluctuations were greatest. The 'barrier' and 'trench' treatments successfully eliminated the belowground root competition between trees and maize and resulted in greater leaf area and higher grain yields than the 'no barrier' treatment. Thus, competition for water rather than competition for light seems to be critical in defining the productivity and sustainability of this alley cropping system.

AB HIV prevention through peer education and condom promotion among truck drivers and their sexual partners is described. Trends during an initial 18-month intensive phase, followed by a 24-month maintenance phase, were monitored with surveys. Trends for self-reported condom use were: increase among men (56 to 74%) during the first phase with a decrease (72%) during the maintenance phase. Respective figures for women were 51%, 91% and 70%. Multivariate analyses revealed that men most likely to report using condoms were unmarried, had children, were more educated, had previously reported a genital ulcer, and perceived themselves at risk for HIV infection (OR = 1.95-3.47). Women tending to use condoms were unmarried, aware of the limitations of condoms, not in denial as to the existence of HITS harboured inaccurate information about HIV transmission and were afraid (OR = 1.35-2.52). Both sets of results suggest that the most sexually experienced men and women who did not have a permanent stable relationship and who perceived themselves at risk, were most likely to use a condom. Peer education teas an effective tool for increasing knowledge and encouraging appropriate behaviour change. Ir was most effective as an intensive high-input intervention and sustainable with the relatively stable population of truck drivers.

AB The health-disease continuum and the current health paradigm neglect the fundamental descriptors of community welfare, including nutrition or malnutrition, equity or poverty, and sustainable development or underdevelopment Current practices have a patient-obey-physician approach that assigns a passive role to patients and inhibits dialogue with community leaders. An alternative critical-holistic perspective can help universities overcome the limits of individual disciplines and current practices. The critical-holistic health, nutrition, and development promotion model offers a productive alternative paradigm for university-community partnerships on health, nutrition, and development issues. The model has been used successfully in education, research, and practice in Brazil and the United States and enhances the linkages among individual, societal, and institutional responsibilities. It is especially valuable in communities where social aspects such as low incomes and contaminated water supplies call for dialogue between health professionals and the community that leads to participatory action.

DE crop-animal systems; research priorities; economic impact
AB Crop-animal systems which form the backbone of agriculture in the tropics are discussed with reference to their characteristics, economic importance of animals, genesis and types of crop-animal systems, relevance and potential importance, and priorities for research and development. These production systems are found across all agroecological zones: rain-fed temperate and highland systems, semi-arid and arid tropics, and sub-humid and humid tropics: the last four are priority areas in Asia. The potential importance of these systems in Asia is reflected in their advantages, synergism and complimentarity, economic benefits and contribution to sustainability. Illustrative case studies are cited which are appropriate to the two broad types of mixed farming systems: systems combining animals and annual cropping, and systems combining animals with perennial cropping with reference to Indonesia, Philippines, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, China and Nigeria. Priorities for research and development should address more complete use of the animal genetic resources, intensive utilisation of the feed resources, development-oriented utilisation of research results, minimizing animal diseases, and implementation of appropriate institutional and policy issues.

LA English
DT Article
AB Nuclear energy will have to cope more and more with a rapid changing environment due to economic competitive pressure and the deregulatory progress. In current economic environment, utilities will have to focus strongly on the reduction of their total generation costs, covering the fuel cycle costs, which are only partly under their control. Developments in the fuel cycle will be in the short-term rather evolutionary addressing the current needs of utilities. However, within the context of sustainable development and more and more inclusion of externalities in energy generation costs, more performing developments in the fuel cycle could become important and feasible. A life-cycle design approach of the fuel cycle will be requested in order to cover all factors in order to decrease significantly the nuclear energy generation cost to compete with other alternative fuels in the long-term.
   This paper will report on some of the trends one could distinguish in the fuel cycle with emphasis on cost reduction. OECD/NEA is currently conducting a study on the feel cycle aiming to assess current and future nuclear fuel cycles according the potential for further improvement of the full added-value chain of these cycles from a mainly technological and economic perspective including environmental and social considerations.

DE retaining structure; active earth pressure; cohesive backfill
AB An analytical solution is developed to determine the active lateral earth pressure distribution on a retaining structure when it consists of a cohesive backfill (internal friction angle phi > 0, cohesion c > 0) with an inclined ground surface. The solution derived encompasses both Bell's equation (for cohesive or cohesionless backfill with a horizontal ground surface) and Rankine's solution (for cohesionless backfill with an inclined ground surface). The orientation of the failure surface is also determined. Results indicate that, unlike the soil-wall scenarios of Bell and Rankine where the failure planes are parallel with a fixed orientation independent of the overburden pressure, for sloping cohesive backfill (phi > 0, c > 0) the slope of the failure surface is a function of the overburden pressure and becomes shallower with depth, thus forming a curvilinear failure surface. The solution developed can also be used to check the sustainability of a slope. The analytical solution can be programmed conveniently in a computer.

DT Article
ID SEA
AB Eleven rajid species are taken around the Falkland Islands, with four species, Bathyraja griseocauda, Bathyraja albomaculata, Bathyraja brachyurops, and Raja flavirostris dominating commercial catches and generally occurring together. Catch limits for individual species are not used in management because species are not separated in the catch or reported separately. The catch per unit effort for the mixed rajid assemblage was standardised using generalised linear modelling techniques, and two production models were used to estimate stock size and sustainable yield. Maximum likelihood methods were used to demonstrate that there are two distinct rajid communities, one to the north and one to the south of the Falkland Islands, which have different sustainable yields. Changes in species composition over the 10-year course of the fishery confirm theoretical expectations that the larger, later-maturing B. griseocauda is being replaced in catches by the smaller, earlier-maturing B. albomaculata and B. brachyurops. These changes in composition were evident after only 6 years of directed fishing. The current fishery to the north of the Falkland Islands appears to be stable at an annual catch of about 3000 t, which is between 6.5 and 7.6% of the estimated pre-exploitation biomass.

ID ENVIRONMENTAL VALUATION; MANAGEMENT; CARBON
AB This study outlines the development of a resource accounting system for a region of public forestland in northern Alberta. The purpose of this exercise is to provide a clearer picture of the market and nonmarket benefits provided by the forest. The services valued include commercial activities such as forestry, trapping, and fishing plus noncommercial or nonmarket activities. Nonmarket services include recreational activities (fishing, hunting, and camping), subsistence resource use, and environmental control services (carbon sequestration and biodiversity maintenance). The case study provides the basis for future estimates that when tracked over time can provide information regarding the sustainability of income flows from the region. Many of the complexities of resource accounting at this finer resolution parallel those of resource accounting at the national level. The case study also illustrates constraints and challenges unique to the regional and forestry context.

AB The lack of appropriate analytical tools to evaluate the impact of forest management policies has hindered the sustainable use of the rain forest. Decisions about the level of forest management and financial investment require accurate predictions of future forest yields. A technique, using hierarchical clustering and canonical discriminant procedures, was developed previously to pool 112 timber species with similar growth increment characteristics into seven groups suitable for the construction of growth and yield models. Compatible growth and yield models were developed for each group by the solution of a system of differential equations expressing the rate of change of ingrowth, mortality, and survival growth components within a forest stand. The solution provides the means to project the status of the timber stand at any future time given some predefined initial stand conditions. The models are useful for inventory updating, allowable annual cut calculations, and management planning for natural or managed stands. They also provide a means to test hypotheses concerning the influence of stand characteristics on increment and to project future product assortments.

AB Results of an experimental investigation of the creep-time behavior of polypropylene and nylon fiber-reinforced concrete (FRC) are presented. Gravity loads were applied in flexure to precracked low volume fraction (0.1%) polypropylene and nylon FRC beams. Beams were tested at a range of stress levels to produce three outcomes: load sustained indefinitely (low stress), creep failure (intermediate stress): and rapid failure (high stress). Emphasis was placed on determining the maximum flexural stress that is sustainable indefinitely. The results indicate that polypropylene FRC has higher initial strength but nylon FRC can sustain a higher stress level. For both groups the sustainable stress is much lower than the postcrack strength. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Globalisation trends in the world economy have led to both a growth an a migration of production and consumption. This brings the environment in which we live and from we profit into focus, and has given rise to the concept of sustainable development. The chemical industry, as a key industry, can assist in realizing this concept by introducing innovative production processes such as process design and material recycle loops. This is covered by the expression "production-integrated environmental protection" (PIEP), sometimes known as "cleaner production" which has the aims of avoiding and reducing residue and using resources carefully. This approach is directly opposed to end-of-pipe environmental protection. The two approaches are compared in this paper. Material productivity is closely linked with PIEP, and can be described by material flow parameters which are given. Finally the results of improvement due to PIEP are presented.

AB Placer Dome is learning from experience in Latin America, Asia and Africa, as well as in North America, that contributing effectively to sustainable human progress in the areas of its operations presents unending challenges to think creatively, communicate effectively and remain culturally sensitive. People must be better off in terms of their economic circumstances, their social conditions and the quality of their natural environment not only during the life elf the mines, but after mines close. Stakeholders, all those who are directly or indirectly affected by a mining project, should be able to participate in decisions which affect them. The development of sustainability strategies, the monitoring of sustainability performance and the implementation of sustainability programs are best done in partnerships with governments, communities, nongovernmental organizations and multilateral development institutions. Ultimately, the success, if nor the survival of mining, will depend on our ability to get the sustainability equation correct.

AB Growing one's own food is an important survival strategy, so it shouldn't be surprising that many urbanites produce food, even in congested cities. Urban agriculture concerns such farming as animal husbandry, the growing of fruit trees, crops of basic grains and horticulture, which coexist in the city with tree crops, and the raising of rabbits, poultry, or other stock.
   With regard to the edible areas, we consider urban open spaces and inner courtyard plots (like homegardens), any small cultivated strips located within town boundaries as well as larger peripheral areas. Urban agriculture refers both to intra and peri-urban surfaces.
   Results from a research project underway in Belem, Brazil, permit us to argue that urban agriculture offers nutritional and environmental benefits. Moreover, urban planners from this Amazonian city have been integrating urban food production into municipal projects with some success.
   The paper provides convincing evidence of the importance of urban food production. We measure the space it utilizes, we mention the various crops and livestock produced, we quantify the food and non-food products consumed or used, we consider the production system, we value the usage of wastes. The paper concludes with the importance of producing environmentally sustainable types of fruits and vegetables to add variety to meals and to enhance the nutrition of the urban poor.

TI Charging for packet-switched network communication-motivation and

AB Packet-switched network technology is expected to form the integration layer for future multi-service networks. The trend to integrate voice and data traffic can already be observed in the Internet and is expected to carry on until the full integration of all media types is achieved. At the same time it becomes obvious that the business model employed for current Internet usage is probably not sustainable for the creation of an infrastructure suitable to support a diverse and ever-increasing range of application services. Currently, the Internet provides only a single class of best-effort service and prices are mainly built on Bat-fee, access-based schemes. However, the large and increasing differentiation of demand for quality of transmission services creates the necessity to differentiate service provision and, consequently, charging for network communications. In this article, we survey relevant service models and motivate the need for appropriate charging mechanisms. We give an overview on requirements for a charging system. its technical components, and issues for future business models that might by employed by service providers. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB The green turtle, Chelonia mydas, is a circumglobal species and a primary herbivore in marine ecosystems. Overexploitation as a food resource for human populations has resulted in drastic declines or extinction of green turtle populations in the Greater Caribbean, Attempts to manage the remaining populations on a sustainable basis are hampered by insufficient knowledge of demographic parameters, In particular, compensatory responses resulting from density-dependent effects have not been evaluated for any sea turtle population and thus have not been explicitly included in any population models.
   Growth rates of immature green turtles were measured during an 18-yr study in Union Creek, a wildlife reserve in the southern Bahamas, We have evaluated the growth data for both straight carapace length (SCL) and body mass with nonparametric regression models that had one response variable (absolute growth rate) and five potential covariates: sex, site, year, mean size, and recapture interval. The SCL model of size-specific growth rates was a good fit to the data and accounted for 59% of the variance. The body-mass model was not a good fit to the data, accounting for only 26% of the variance, In the SCL model, sex, site, year, and mean size all had significant effects, whereas recapture interval did not.
   We used results of the SCL model to evaluate a density-dependent effect on somatic growth rates. Over the 18 yr of our study, relative population density underwent a sixfold increase followed by a threefold decrease in Union Creek as a result of natural immigration and emigration. Three lines of evidence support a density-dependent effect. First, there is a significant inverse correlation between population density and mean annual growth rate, Second, the condition index (mass/(SCL)(3)) of green turtles in Union Creek is positively correlated with mean annual growth rates and was negatively correlated with population density, indicating that the green turtles were nutrient limited during periods of low growth and high population densities. Third, the population in Union Creek fluctuated around carrying capacity during our study and thus was at levels likely to experience density-dependent effects that could be measured.
   We estimate the carrying capacity of pastures of the seagrass Thalassia testudinum, the major diet plant of the green turtle, as a range from 122 to 4439 kg green turtles/ha or 16-586 million 50-kg green turtles in the Caribbean. Because green turtle populations are probably regulated by food limitation under natural conditions, carrying capacity can serve as a baseline to estimate changes in green turtle populations in the Caribbean since pre-Columbian times and to set a goal for recovery for these depleted populations.
   Finally, we compare the growth functions for green turtle populations in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Not only does the form of the size-specific growth functions differ between the two regions (monotonic declining in the Atlantic and nonmonotonic in the Pacific), but also small juvenile green turtles in the Atlantic have substantially higher growth rates than those in the Pacific. Research is needed to evaluate the causes of these differences, but our results indicate that demographic parameters between ocean basins should only be extrapolated with great caution.

   disincentives
AB While innovation processes toward sustainable development (eco-innovations) have received increasing attention during the past years, theoretical and methodological approaches to analyze these processes are poorly developed. Against this background, the term eco-innovation is introduced in this paper addressing explicitly three kinds of changes towards sustainable development: technological, social and institutional innovation. Secondly, the potential contribution of neoclassical and (co-)evolutionary approaches from environmental and innovation economics to eco-innovation research is discussed. Three peculiarities of eco-innovation are identified: the double externality problem, the regulatory push/pull effect and the increasing importance of social and institutional innovation. While the first two are widely ignored in innovation economics, the third is at the least not elaborated appropriately. The consideration of these peculiarities may help to overcome market failure by establishing a specific eco-innovation policy and to avoid a 'technology bias' through a broader understanding of innovation. Finally, perspectives for a specific contribution of ecological economics to eco-innovation research are drawn. It is argued that methodological pluralism as established in ecological economics would be very beneficial for eco-innovation research. A theoretical framework integrating elements from both neoclassical and evolutionary approaches should be pursued in order to consider the complexity of factors influencing innovation decisions as well as the specific role of regulatory instruments. And the experience gathered in ecological economics integrating ecological, social and economic aspects of sustainable development is highly useful for opening up innovation research to social and institutional changes.

AB Theoretically, the modern intertemporal model of current account determination implies the stationarity of the current account. However, the empirical finding in the literature indicates nonstationary current account balances based on conventional unit-root tests. Applying the panel data unit-root test of Lm, Pesaran and Shin, we find support for the mean-reverting property of the current account. This, in turn, lends support to the intertemporal approach to the current account. The policy implication of our findings is that current account deficits in major industrial countries are sustainable. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved.

ID AGENCY COSTS; OWNERSHIP; TAKEOVERS
AB The decade-long boom in the US stock market and the more recent boom in the US economy have fostered widespread belief in the economic benefits of the maximization of shareholder value as a principle of corporate governance. In this paper, we provide an historical analysis of the rise of shareholder value as a principle of corporate governance in the United States, tracing the transformation of US corporate strategy from an orientation towards retention of corporate earnings and reinvestment in corporate growth through the 1970s to one of downsizing of corporate labour forces and distribution of corporate earnings to shareholders over the past two decades. We then consider the recent performance of the US economy, and raise questions about the relation between the maximization of shareholder value and the sustainability of economic prosperity.

AB This study aims to investigate the ISO 14001 implementation process and its implications for regional environmental management. The region of Central Japan (known as Chubu in Japanese. which literally means center) was chosen for this case study. The study focuses on selected issues such as the: (1) trends and motives of private firms in the implementation of an ISO 14001-based environmental management system (EMS); (2) obstacles during system implementation; (3) role of the system in enhancing environmental performance within the certified organization; and (4) relation between the major stakeholders, local citizens, governments, and firms after adopting the system. To achieve these objectives, a questionnaire survey was mailed to all certified firms in the region. A 58% response was achieved overall. The results show that the main aims behind the adoption of ISO 14001 by firms in the Chubu region are to improve the environmental aspects within the enterprises and to enhance the employees' environmental awareness and capacity. The results have also shown that the ISO 14001-based EMS has had a great effect on a firm's environmental status as certified firms have claimed that natural resources such as fuel, water, and paper consumption have been more efficiently managed after adopting the system. implementation of the system causes the firms to consider the role of the local people and the government in more effectively involving the local people in the firm's daily environmental activities. It also helps to enhance the environmental awareness among the local people. Adopting the system also promotes a better relation within the enterprises affiliated to the same group, such as more attention given by the parent firms (head offices) towards other firms working for the same group, or branches-mainly small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs)-in the field of EMS. Finally, the results show that firms give serious consideration to their final products' impacts on the environment. In other words, attention is given to life cycle analysis (LCA) among certified firms.

AB The management of riverine wetlands, recognized as a major component of biodiversity in fluvial hydrosystems, is problematic. Preservation or restoration of such ecosystems requires a method to assess the major ecological processes operating in the wetlands, the sustainability of the aquatic stage, and the restoration potential of each riverine wetland. We propose a method of diagnosis based on aquatic macrophytes and helophytes. Plant communities are used because they are easy to survey and provide information about (1) the origin of a water supply (i.e., groundwater, seepage, or surface river water) and its nutrient content, (2) effects of flood disturbances, and (3) terrestrialization processes. The novelty of the method is that, in contrast to available typologies, it is based on the interference of gradients resulting from several processes, which makes it possible to predict wetland sustainability and restoration potential. These predictions result from knowledge of the processes involved in terrestrialization, i.e., the influence of flood disturbances, occurrence of groundwater supplies, trophic degree, and water permanency of the habitat during a yearly cycle. The method is demonstrated on five different river systems.

DE Chesapeake Bay; public health; indicators; environment; report card
AB The Chesapeake Bay has a profound impact on the lives of all who reside in the 64,000 square miles of its watershed. From crab cakes to sailboats, drinking water to naval ships, the Bay touches virtually every aspect of life in the region. The Bay has inspired literature, driven the regional economy, and shaped political decision making and development patterns for homes, industry, agriculture,and transportation. As population demands increase and urban boundaries expand into pristine landscapes, the sustainability of the Chesapeake Bay and its resources face unprecedented pressures. Consequently, the public's health also is vulnerable to Bay pollution and other stresses stemming from development activities and widespread growth occurring throughout the Chesapeake Bay watershed. This paper will examine the linkages between the environmental quality of the Bay and the population health status, recommend ways to bridge ecological and human health concerns in the context of the Bay, and finally present a framework for developing a public health report card for the Bay.

AB This article is premised on the assumption that in order for us adequately to protect our environment, significant, adjustments need to be made to the ways we pursue and think about development -adjustments not merely to technologies but also to life-styles. In this respect the emphasis in much recent development literature on human development is to be welcomed as a useful corrective to definitions of development in terms of economic growth, though there is still a danger of anthropocentric assumptions. It is argued that, given suitable interpretations or conceptions of development and environment, environmental care can be, and should be, integrated into authentic human development. Proposals for such conceptual alignment stem both from seeing the relevant community in which development qua desirable change is to take place as the biotic community, and from seeing development as desirable change in the total environment, both natural and artificial, regarded as a social field of significance. Such conceptual adjustments are a significant part, but of course only a part, of what needs to be done to bring public policy more into line with proper care for the environment.

AB It is argued in this paper that the orthodox sustainable transport vision leads to the further empowerment of technocratic and elitist groups in society while simultaneously contributing to the further disempowerment of those marginalized social groups who were already bearing the burden of the environmental problems resulting from a troubled transport system. Scaler redefinitions of the transport problem play a prominent role in the twin processes of empowerment and disempowerment. Furthermore, the contributions of spatial planning and neo-classical transport economics to the sustainable transport discourses will be critically investigated. The issues of transport inequality and transport poverty should be re-inserted into the dominant transport policy debates and practices.

AB Background. The traditional concept of continuity of ca re, i.e. care from the cradle to the grave, is no longer sustainable in modern society.
   Objective. The aim of this study was to propose a definition of continuity of care' based on the experiences of a group of practising Australian GPs.
   Method. Five focus group discussions were conducted to explore the understanding a nd practice of continuity of care, the individual's measurement of having achieved continuity of care in his/her practice and the advantages/disadvantages of providing continuity of care.
   Results and conclusions. The experiences of this group of GPs points towards three essential aspects to help with a definition of continuity of care. Firstly it requires a stable care environment, secondly good communication to build a responsible doctor-patient relationship and thirdly the goal of achieving an improvement of the patient's overall health.

AB Rice-wheat rotations are the most important cropping system of the Indo-Gangetic plains. We measured the long-term sustainability of the system for green manuring and chemical fertilizer input practices utilising the trends in grain yield, partial factor productivity (PFP), agronomic efficiency, benefit:cost ratio, soil organic carbon content (OC) and sustainable yield index (SM). The data of a long-term experiment conducted at six locations in the Indo-Gangetic plain region of India revealed that grain yield and PFP of both rice and wheat declined under control (no fertilizer, no green manure) and sub-optimal fertilizer inputs (50 or 75% recommended fertilizer NPK) at all locations. Complete dose of fertilizer NPK (100% recommended) increased grain yields as well as PFP in rice but did not prevent decline in these parameters in wheat. Partial substitution of chemical fertilizer with Sesbania green manure, however, brought further improvement in yield and PFP in rice and the residual effect of green manure reversed the declining trend in wheat. The SYI and agronomic efficiency of fertilizers were also greater in plots receiving 100% fertilizer NPK or green manuring along with 50 or 75% recommended NPK. Benefit : cost ratio of fertilizer inputs and green manuring practices increased in both crops and for all treatments, indicating that the benefit accruing from fertilizer improved with time. At locations with high initial OC, a depletion of OC was noticed whereas OC increased at locations with low initial OC, with OC stabilizing between 0.60 and 0.65%. Trends in grain yield, PFP and agronomic efficiency of fertilizer appear promising tools to measure sustainability of fertilizer management practices. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

DE aquaculture; Australia; enhancement; irrigation
AB The concept of integrating aquaculture with irrigated fanning systems was evaluated in three projects in the Goulburn-Murray Irrigation District (GMID) in south-eastern Australia. (1) Semi-intensive cage culture trials using silver perch, Bidyanus bidyanus (Mitchell), were undertaken in a range of irrigated farming systems: irrigation supply channels, groundwater supplies; and on-farm storage dams. Survival and growth of fish under these conditions were comparable to fish reared in conventional aquaculture ponds. However, poor water quality at some sites reduced survival and growth. (2) A study was undertaken to assess the feasibility of the cage culture of silver perch and rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss (Walbaum), in three irrigation water storage reservoirs. Conditions within each reservoir, particularly water quality, wind and wave action, and cage fouling, varied considerably, and influenced fish growth and survival. (3) Mariculture trials were undertaken in two saline groundwater evaporation basins, which were part of an integrated agriforestry and salt reclamation system. The species tested included two oyster, two prawn and nine fish species. Some species exhibited exceptional survival and growth rates under trial conditions. These projects indicate that the concept of integrating aquaculture with existing irrigated fanning systems has the potential to enhance productivity, water use efficiency and overall environmental sustainability in the GMID.

ID SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; MANAGEMENT; UK
AB The conservation of biodiversity in aquatic habitats has become an increasingly important challenge in the management of water resources. In addition to the complexity of the lake fishery and the management structure, the popularity of gill net fishing, in particular, has brought problems when re-establishing populations of Arctic charr, Salvelinus alpinus (L.), collecting genetically sustainable numbers of spawners of the land-locked salmon, Salmo salar nl. sebago (Girard), and increasing the population of the Saimaa ringed seal, Phoca hispida saimensis (Nordq.) to a sustainable level in the Vuoksi watercourse, south-east Finland. The attitudes towards protection among the users and other interested parties vary. In order to enhance the coexistence of the lake fishery and endangered species over large water areas, improved institutional linkages are needed among the local, regional and governmental levels of the fragmented decision-making regime. Environmental interests should also be integrated into the communication structure.

DE ethical trade; fair trade; organic production; Ethical Trading
   Initiative (ETI); ethical consumer
AB In recent years there has been a growing debate about ethical aspects of production and trade. This has evolved from concerns about fair trade, safe working conditions for producers and employees and sustainable and environmentally safe natural resource management. The principles of organic agriculture are wide ranging and include concerns for safe food production, for the environment, for animal welfare and for issues of social justice. A working definition of ethical trading, and an assessment of the links between organic production and ethical trading were obtained from 34 organisations in the UK involved in ethical or fair trading or organic agriculture. Interviewees were from major supermarkets, independent and multiple retailers, alternative trading organisations, importers, wholesalers, accreditation bodies, non-governmental development agencies and lobby groups. A definition of ethical trading based on the interviewees' responses is developed and discussed. The paper examines current practice in ethical and organic trading and assesses the role of the Ethical Trading Initiative and major supermarkets. Current and potential links between organic production and ethical trade are explored. Constraints to linking the two concepts more fully, both conceptual and practical, are evaluated. There is potential for organic production to be ethical, using the holistic definition given here, by the addition of social criteria to the standards of the organic regulatory authorities. Ethical trading is now becoming mainstream trading and internationally traded organic produce will therefore have to comply with the current view of what is ethical. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

DE dimethyl ether; coal; power generation
AB Dimethyl ether (DME) is a clean and sustainable alternative fuel that can be produced from natural gas, coal or other organic resources through syngas. The properties of DME are suitable for the production of power generation fuel, transportation fuel, home fuel and chemicals. Production of DME fuel from unutilized natural gas or coal resources in remote areas will contribute in solving the energy-environment dilemma. An innovative process of direct synthesis of DME from syngas in a slurry bed has been developed with a bench plant (50 kg/day). Further development of the project using a pilot scale plant (5 t/day) commenced in 1997 with governmental support. The feasibility study of the International Development Engineering Society of Japan indicates that the production cost of DME is competitive to conventional fuel price, and the cost of electricity generation using DME is the same as that of a coal-fired power station with a much lower environmental load. The most realistic scenario for the introduction of DME fuel in Asia in the early 21st century is its promotion as a thermal power plant fuel in Japan as a clean motor vehicle fuel in large cities of Asia, and as a substitute for liquefied petroleum gas or kerosene in Asia.

   MODERNITY; POLICY
AB Despite widespread recognition that human impacts are having a detrimental impact upon the environment and the incorporation of sustainable development into policy at a variety of spatial scales, the actual implementation of sustainability remains problematic. By contrast with the rather vague and all-encompassing concept of sustainable development, some authors have argued that ecological modernization is a much more rigorous approach which focuses upon reconciling the tensions between economic development and ecological crisis to form a new model of development for capitalist economies. As an approach it is specifically put forward as one which can provide both a theoretical and a practical guide to an appropriate response. In this paper the potential contribution of ecological modernization as both theory and guide to pragmatic action are explored by reference to the development of regional policy and regional development agencies (RDAs) in the English regions. It would appear that although the practical implications of ecological modernisation have been partially incorporated into regional policy, these have been progressively watered down in the move from policy formulation to implementation. Ecological modernisation may have more to offer as a theoretical approach where it allows us to think about these problems of policy implementation. The paper concludes with a critique of ecological modernisation as a perspective on the environmental problematic. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We report the results of a deep-towed magnetic survey of part of a Mid-Atlantic Ridge spreading segment. Analysis of the magnetic reversals indicates that for the past 0.7 m.y., magmatic accretion at the end of the segment has been effectively one sided, with new crust being added only to the outside corner of the ridge offset (eastern flank), and not to the inside corner (western flank). Spreading on the inside corner was accommodated by significant displacement on a single, large fault. The area between the fault and the axial volcanic ridge was effectively a thin static sliver at the plate boundary during this process. In the short term, asymmetric magmatic accretion was probably accomplished by progressively shifting the axial volcanic ridge to a new location at the inside corner (western) edge of the old one. Asymmetric spreading is unlikely to be sustainable as a steady-state process. The termination of a period of asymmetric spreading may be achieved either by establishing a new axial volcanic ridge to a position on the outside corner (eastern) plate (thus isolating the old axial volcanic ridge on the inside-corner plate), or by simply arresting movement on the large fault, and reverting to symmetric spreading at the axial volcanic ridge. Highly asymmetric accretion may be a common process at slow-spreading segments, particularly near discontinuities. This asymmetry cannot be maintained for long periods, and may be directly linked to intervals of spreading by tectonic extension.

AB This paper describes the development of a theoretically based sex education programme currently undergoing a randomized controlled trial in the UK. It considers some of the practical difficulties involved in translating research-based conclusions into acceptable, replicable and potentially effective classroom lessons. The discussion acknowledges that the implications of social psychological research and the requirements of rigorous evaluation may conflict with accepted principles inherent in current sex education practice. It also emphasizes that theoretical ideas must be carefully embedded in lessons which are informed by an awareness of classroom culture, and the needs and skills of teachers. For example, the use of same-sex student groups to reflect on the gendered construction of sexuality may be problematic. Materials must be tailored to recipients' circumstances, which may require substituting for limited experience with the use of detailed scripts and scenarios. Furthermore, role-play techniques for sexual negotiation that work elsewhere may not be effective in the UK, The use of trigger video sessions and other techniques are recommended. Finally, the problems involved in promoting condom-related skills are discussed. The paper concludes that, if an intervention is to be sustainable beyond the research stage, it must be designed to overcome such problems while remaining theoretically informed.

ID MANAGEMENT
AB This paper explores future leadership requirements for health services in the context of relevant leadership theory and the changing environment for health services in the UK. The output of leadership research is both prolific and confusing. and its applicability to health services management uncertain especially in the context of constraints on the strategic managerial behaviour and choices of public service managers. The introduction of general management to the UK NHS in the 1980s, followed by an internal market for healthcare in 1990, should have provided the opportunity for managers to work differently and to create personal space for leadership. However, it is not known whether sustainable, new ways of leadership working have emerged although it is reasonable to hypothesise from studies elsewhere that a number of contextual and behavioural leadership models are likely to be found in the NHS. Although management researchers have explored networking and referred to the impact of the external environment of leadership, insufficient importance has been attached to-date to the impact of future trends in health services on the leadership of change in the health sector. The paper argues that in future health services leadership will require much more than traditional networking with other organisations and groups and will need to focus on developing and securing external agreement to an agenda for positive change, turning the apparent constraints of the external environment, determined primarily by government policies, into opportunities. In other words the demands of external or contextual leadership will increase forcing a stronger focus on having to achieve change through others. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

AB Genetic analyses have much to offer fisheries managers, especially in the provision of tools enabling unequivocal specimen identification and assessment of stock structure. The three commonly-used genetic tools - allozymes, mitochondrial DNA and microsatellites - differ in their properties. These differences must be born in mind, especially when interpreting gene frequency data collected for stock structure research. Examples where genetic approaches have been used to identify specimens are given, with special attention being given to compliance and labelling issues. Treatment of stock structure focuses on Atlantic cod and on yellowfin, bigeye and albacore tunas. The different resolving powers of the various techniques are discussed. Marine fish typically show low levels of population genetic differentiation, and in such species the use of large sample sizes and, preferably, multiple types of markers are desirable to resolve stock structure issues.

ID WATER-RESOURCES
AB This study proposes an empirical approach that can lead to the sustainable management of groundwater resources. This approach enables a comprehensive understanding of an aquifer, delineates distinct hydrological scenarios, and recommends a set of operational activities for each sub-region of the aquifer. The paper focuses on the Coastal aquifer of the Gaza Strip region which has been divided into three sub-regions. The southern sub-region (WSW) is classified as scenario "+a2" which indicates that it can be used as a multi-annual groundwater reservoir. The northern sub-region (NW-E) is designated scenario "-a2", where the recommended operational measures include injection of freshwater in wells and cleaning of the surface environment. The third sub-region (CSE), is classified as scenario "-b2", which requires severe management measures to correct both a negative hydrological and environmental situation. The approach also involves on-going monitoring of the aquifer, and can be considered as an empirical tool to provide preliminary guidelines for long-term groundwater management.

AB The paper presents a review of the ICID's activities in the "systems" strategy theme and recommendations regarding new emphases in these activities. Developments by the ICID working groups currently allocated to this strategy theme are analysed as far as consolidation of tasks, and rationalisatio of work bodies are concerned.
   Specific proposals submitted for consideration are :
   Working Group on Drainage: The mandate and activities schedule of this Group be revised to also provide for the drainage problems by small-scale African farmers.
   Working Group on Integrated Land and Water Management: Expansion of the activity plan to include i.a. provision for value systems of affected communities; institutional requirements; public participation; resource management structure; implementation strategies; and auditing procedures.
   Working Group on Development and Management of Irrigation Systems: Adding to the current activity plan the additional dimension of small-scale irrigation in Africa especially concerning crop irrigation requirements and water supply management. These additions are due to the unique characteristics of irrigation in this part of the world.
   Gender issues in irrigated agriculture: Since the role of women cuts across the activities of all the ICID Working Groups, joint ventures on an inter-strategy theme level are proposed. Promotion of empowerment regarding sustainable resource use; training and skills development; equipment and technology; and institutional framework and capacity, is identified as a thrust that needs to be attended to by a number of ICID Working Groups.

AB For the superposition of ON/OFF sources, we propose a real-time computable two-state Markov modulated Poisson process [MMPP(2)] modeling method characterizing the aggregate cell arrival rate and the variance-time curve for cell counts. Numerical examples show that the proposed method yields a good estimation of cell loss ratio (CLR) in asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) multiplexers, Then, we propose an approximation method for calculating the workload for the MMPP(2)/D/1 system. By considering the workload as an upper bound of CLR of ATM multiplexers, He propose a connection admission control (CAC) algorithm utilizing peak cell rate, sustainable cell rate, and maximum burst size as user traffic descriptors. Using the proposed CAC algorithm, an acceptance decision is made with computational complexities of less than 3000 floating point operations. It is also observed from numerical evaluations that the proposed CAC algorithm yields a high multiplexing gain, compared with other methods in the literature.

SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON COMMUNICATIONS
LA English
DT Article
DE ATM network; TCP/IP; variable bit rate; usage parameter control;
   selective cell discard
AB It is important to establish the technology to accommodate best effort TCP/IP traffic over wide area ATM networks. The UBR (Unspecified Bit Rate) service category is the most typical service category for the best effort traffic, especially in the LAN environment. On the other hand, the VER (Variable Bit Rate) service category with SCD (Selective Cell Discard) option is considered as the service category which is appropriate for wide area networks due to its fairness and minimum guarantee of the cell transmission using not only PCR (Peak Cell Rate) but SCR (Sustainable Cell Rate) and MBS (Maximum Burst Size). However, there is no actual evaluation for such service. We have, therefore, performed the experimental studies on TCP/IP over VER with SCD along with UBR and VER without SCD by VC (Virtual Channel) level policing when each TCP connection is mapped to a different VC. Through these experiments, we measured the link utilization of the effective data and the fairness between each obtained TCP throughput during the congestion of the ATM switch. From the results of the link utilization, the value is over 95% under the various conditions. Therefore, even in the case of the cell losses due to SCD or buffer overflow in ATM switch congestion, average throughput is almost the same as the value which equals the trunk line speed divided by the number of the accommodated TCP connections. From the results of the fairness, VER with SCD per VC is better than UBR and also obtains better TCP throughput than VER without SCD. Furthermore, to confirm those characteristics more generally, we adopt the accommodated TCP connections not only with the same TCP send/receive socket buffer size but with different sizes. Finally, we discuss the effectiveness between VER with SCD and the other service categories, such as UBR and ABR (Available Bit Rate) and GFR (Guaranteed Frame Rate), and conclude that VER with SCD is one of the most suitable ATM service categories for accommodating best effort traffic.

AB A field experiment was conducted during rainy season (kharif of 1993-94 to 1995-96 at Jhansi to study the productivity and sustainability of food-fodder alley cropping systems under dryland conditions of Bundelkhand region. Data revealed that significantly more grain, stover yield of sorghum, green fodder, dry-matter yield of fodder crops and sorghum grain equivalent yield were obtained in no tree association (control) compared with the farm boundary plantations with shisham (Dalbergia sissoo Roxb, ex DC) and alley species with subabul (Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit). Intercropping of sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.) + pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan L. Millsp) gave significantly highest grain and stover yield of sorghum compared with the other systems. Sorghum + cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L.) intercropping system gave significantly highest green fodder and dry-matter yield compared with the sorghum + grass strips. Among the different manurial schedules, half inorganic fertilizer + half organic manure doses gave significantly highest grain and stover yield of sorghum, green fodder and dry-matter yield of fodder crops and sorghum grain equivalent yield over the other manurial schedules.

DE tuberculosis; treatment; programme; clubs; Ethiopia
AB SETTING: A rural district (Estie) in South Gender, Ethiopia.
   OBJECTIVE: TO describe the contribution of 'TB clubs' (small support groups of patients based on where they live) to the performance of the tuberculosis control programme in Estie District.
   DESIGN: A descriptive study of the formation of 'TB clubs', their contribution to case-finding and the treatment outcomes before and after formation of the 'TB clubs'.
   RESULTS: The proportion of actual among expected attendances of tuberculosis patients for follow-up during treatment at health facilities significantly increased (P < 0.001) after the introduction of the TB clubs. Community elders, community health agents and local health workers helped TB clubs to refer tuberculosis suspects, promote treatment adherence and trace defaulters as an integral part of a district tuberculosis programme. The TB clubs referred 181 tuberculosis suspects in the community for investigation, of whom 65% subsequently had a diagnosis of tuberculosis. TB clubs identified 69% of all patients and 76% of new sputum smear-positive pulmonary patients diagnosed in the district. Treatment success rates in new sputum smear-positive, smear-negative and extra-pulmonary tuberculosis patients were 83%, 79% and 81%, respectively.
   CONCLUSION: The formation of TB clubs contributed to the effective implementation of a district tuberculosis programme. Further evaluation is needed to assess the sustainability and applicability of the approach in other settings.

TI An explosive subsoiler for the improvement of meadow soil, part 2: Soil
   bin experiments
SO JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ENGINEERING RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB An explosive subsoiler was envisaged and designed to achieve greater soil rupture volume and longer sustainability of drainage for the improvement of meadow soil. In this paper, the results are presented from soil bin experiments with the explosive subsoiler, that were conducted in Japan prior to field experiments in China, to investigate soil rupture volume.
   The results showed that the sand and pseudogley soil were broken down by a moving subsoiler with gas injection. With a gas flow rate of 10 g/s, a pressure of about 6 kPa was produced at the nozzle port, a cavity was formed underground, and the subsoil was disturbed. Both forward and lateral rupture distances were constant, regardless of the differences in the soil and the gas flow rate. Hence, the average forward rupture distance was 0.75 m and the average lateral rupture distance was 0.25 m. Both values were influenced by the shape of the subsoiler body. Only 13% of the power required for gas injection was used in cavity formation, while the remaining 87% induced soil disturbance. (C) 2000 Silsoe Research Institute.

AB We tested biological control agents for the control of 3rd-instar scarab turfgrass pests, both for the masked chafer Cyclocephala hirta LeConte and the Japanese beetle, Popillia japonica Newman. The former species is endemic in California whereas the latter, although not yet established, constitutes a permanent serious threat to agriculture and horticulture in California. We conducted experiments using C, hirta in California and P, japonica in New Jersey. A field trial conducted in 2 different California turfgrass sites compared the field persistence in the absence of hosts of Bacillus thuringiensis Berliner subspecies japonensis Buibui strain, the milky disease bacterium, Paenibacillus (=Bacillus) popilliae (Dutky), and the entomopathogenic nematodes Steinernema kushidai Mamiya and Heterorhabditis bacteriophora Poinar to that of the organophosphate diazinon. Soil samples taken 0-70 d after applications were bio-assayed with P, japonica. Only diazinon and the entomopathogenic nematode S. kushidai caused substantial mortality and S. kushidai activity persisted significantly longer than diazinon activity. In greenhouse experiments, combinations of entomopathogenic nematode species usually resulted in additive mortality of scarab larvae. Combinations of S, kushidai and diazinon also resulted in additive mortality. In field trials, the efficacy of H. bacteriophora and especially S. kushidai and S. glaseri, was comparable to that of diazinon over 14-18 d. However, it is likely that at least S. kushidai would have outperformed diazinon over an extended period because of its longer persistence and potential for recycling in the hosts. S. kushidai, should it become commercially available, deserves further examination as an alternative to chemical white grub control especially as a highly compatible component of sustainable turfgrass management.

TI Macroeconomic measures of 'sustainability'
SO JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC SURVEYS

ID NET NATIONAL PRODUCT; PRESERVATION; RESOURCES
AB This paper reviews the policy need for indicators of 'sustainable development', and the impetus behind recent moves to establish official indicators. The range of indicators available from current economic theory is then examined. These measures may be divided into those based on flows and those based on stocks. Flow-based measures are essentially attempts to adjust Net National Product to transform it into an indicator of sustainability. Stock-based measures revolve around the concept of the natural and man-made capital stocks. We also consider the idea of Safe Minimum Standards as a sustainability indicator. The paper concludes that no currently-available single measure of sustainability is likely to be adequate.

AB Survival and reproductive performance were measured at nine temperature-salinity (T-S) combinations (15 degrees C, 24 degrees C and 30 degrees C/60 ppt, 120 ppt and 180 ppt) for four sexual (Artemia franciscana, A. salina, A. sinica and A. persimilis) and one parthenogenetic (A. parthenogenetica) species of brine shrimp. There was significant interaction between temperature and salinity for survival and reproductive traits. For most species there was disconcordance among seven performance estimators (LT50, 21-day survival, r, and four female reproductive traits) for the optimal T-S combination. We propose that the best ecological estimator of reproductive success is cohort reproductive output because it incorporates both survival (I,) and reproductive (rn,) functions. All species had maximum reproduction at 24 degrees C; at 120 ppt for A. parthenogenetica, A. sinica and A. franciscana, and at 180 ppt for A. salina and A. persimilis. There was only one T-S combination (24 degrees C/120 ppt) where all species completed their life cycle. While at least one Artemia species reproduced at eight of the nine possible T-S combinations, sustainable reproduction (where R-o greater than or equal to 1) occurred at only five T-S combinations. A. parthenogenetica had the narrowest tolerance range of T-S combinations, contradicting the general purpose genotype hypothesis advanced for obligately parthenogenetic species.

AB A detailed investigation of endogenous acetylcholine (ACh) release from primary embryonic septal cultures is described in this study. Applications of veratridine (25 mu M) or increasing extracellular concentrations of K+ (6-100 mM) induced robust increases of endogenous ACh release (similar to 500-15,000 fmol/well/10 min). Release stimulated with K+ (25 mM) was sustainable and did not differ significantly over 180 min. ACh release was dependent on extracellular choline and decreased proportionally to choline concentrations (0-10 mu M). For example, after 30 min of stimulation with K+ (25 mM), release in the absence of extracellular choline was similar to 25% of that associated with 10 mM choline. The vesicular transport blocker vesamicol (0-5 mu M) almost completely prevented stimulated and basal ACh release at the highest concentration evaluated, which suggests a mostly vesicular mode of release in this model. The M-2-like muscarinic receptor antagonist AF-DX 384 (0-10 mu M) enhanced stimulated ACh release (similar to 150% at the highest concentration evaluated), whereas the nonspecific muscarinic receptor agonist oxotremorine (0-10 mu M) decreased stimulated release (similar to 60% at the highest concentration evaluated), suggesting that functional muscarinic autoreceptors exist in primary embryonic septal cultures. Novel findings concerning ACh release from primary embryonic septal cultures are reported herein, and the demonstration of ACh release gives further credit to the use of these cultures for studying cholinergic system functioning and in relation to physiology and pathology.

AB Research by Academia Sinica shows that current crop production on the loess plateau is only slightly higher than one third of the potential. Soil water relationships and nutrient supply have been investigated and a long term (18 years) field experiment conducted. This work shows that the soil does have the capacity to support sustainable crop production and that higher yields are possible through appropriate fertilizer usage and irrigation. The fertility of loess-derived soil is related to characteristics of the loess such as depth of the deposit, loose structure, water storage capacity and ammonium fixation capacity and its release to crops. On sloping land soil and water loss is significant; a prime requirement for the reduction of nutrient loss is the control of erosion. The two main factors limiting crop production are: drought stress and nitrogen deficiency. Covering the soil with plastic film or straw (or other crop residues) is effective in conserving soil moisture. Breeding of crop varieties more efficient in nutrient utilisation and more tolerant of drought stress can make a contribution to improvement of production.

AB This paper models the London stock market's response to the 1994 Periodic Review of prices in the English and Welsh water industry using both GARCH and stochastic volatility models. The results indicate that a significant reduction in the volatility of share prices for eight of the ten water and sewerage companies followed the announcement of revised industry price-caps. Investor expectations adjusted rapidly, reflecting confidence in the credibility and political sustainability of the settlement.

ID SMOKING PREVENTION PROGRAMS; MINNESOTA
AB Efforts to develop effective and sustainable school health programs evolved in sophistication the past 20 years through research and practical experience. This paper reviews these developments, arguing they were significantly driven by public health priorities, and have not adequately accounted for educational perspectives and priorities. To better understand the differences in perspective, a model is presented which illustrates linkages between different school-based inputs and strategies, and long-term health and educational outcomes. The model describes similarities and differences between the two perspectives. A significant coincidence exists in factors that determine educational attainment and improved health outcomes for students. A more holistic and integrated approach to school health is emerging, and at these interfaces our implementation and research efforts for the 21st century should be concentrated.

AB The tidal flood defences in London protect the city and its citizens from potentially catastrophic flooding. In recent years there has been increased recognition of the environmental value of the tidal Thames; however, this environmental renaissance has been matched by increased river-side development, creating intense pressures upon the tidal Thames environment.
   Building on the application of environmental assessment at the project level, the Environment Agency is developing new tools to evaluate the cumulative environmental impact of works to individual frontages. Using current case studies, this paper describes practical examples of these approaches which aim to provide sustainable and economically justifiable flood defences and contribute to the enhancement of the tidal Thames.

AB Source control is regarded as a key principle in supporting concepts of sustainable management and integrated pollution control for diffuse non-point stormwater runoff, with infiltration procedures being a prime component of such source-control systems. The potential conflicts between the benefits of groundwater recharge and the risks to long-term groundwater quality uncertainties associated with infiltration disposal are considered. The long-term performance of a number of infiltration systems is reported in terms of their pollutant removal efficiencies, and the utility of an infiltration acceptability matrix approach is reviewed.

AB The use of solution activators (dissolved metal salts) to enhance aluminum electrochemical activity in organic media is reported. Aluminum is electrochemically passive in most organic electrolytes and unlike lithium, has not been developed as a battery anode in organic media. We demonstrate significant Al activity in two electrolytes, AlCl3 in gamma-butyrolactone or (C2H5)(4)NCl in acetonitrile. These improve the anodic potential by up to 1 V in comparison to other electrolytes and increase from microampere to milliampere per square centimeter, the sustainable Al oxidation current. Electrolytic metal acetate, chloride, or other salts can further enhance these favorable anodic characteristics. Unlike Sn(II), Sn(IV), or Ga(III), both Hg(II) and In(III) significantly activate Al redox behavior. In 1 M AlCl3/gamma-butyrolactone, the Al oxidative polarization is 100,65. 36, or only 28 Ohm cm(2) in electrolytes containing, respectively, 0, 1: 10, 100 mM Hg(II). Hg(II) also shifts negatively the observed E(Al)degrees by 150 to 250 mV, an enhancement sustained during extended anodic galvanostatic discharge. Similarly, as little as 1 mM In(III) diminishes polarization to 1 0 Ohm cm(2) Addition of 10 mM In(II) to 0.3 M (C2H5)(4)NCl in acetonitrile, improves E(Al)degrees by 0.4 to -157 V vs. I-3-/I.

DT Article
AB The land use development on the catchment area have to consider the sustainability of the natural resources, particularly water and soil fertility. Therefore, the risks of land use development must be minimized. This paper presents a methodology and analysis of the land use risks on sediment yield from a catchment area and propose some suggestions to maintain the catchment area function. The universal soil loss equation (USLE) in combination with IDRISI software package was used in this study. Five thematic maps of USLE parameters; rainfall erosivity (R), soil erodibility factor (K), length-slope-steepness factor (LS), land use factor (C), and conservation factor (P) were constructed by digitizing them on computer data base with an element size of 200 X 200 m(2). The spatial and temporal changes on catchment area (land use and sediment yield) were obtained by comparing two set of maps from different period. The proposed method is applied at Wonogiri catchment area in Indonesia. From this study, it was found that there are significant risks of the land use on the sediment yields and the existing land use have to be modified to reduce the sediment yields.

DT Article
AB This study examines the factors influencing pesticide and fertilizer use and analyzes the possible impact of reducing the application rates of the two inputs on product supply, farm income, and input structure. A land-productivity-specific model is estimated using the data of farm households from Kyushu. The substitutability and complementarity between factors are found to be the main determinants influencing the use of pesticides and fertilizer, while the effects of product prices are not determinate. The conditions for reducing the application rates of the two inputs have been favorable, and consequently the widespread adoption of low-input sustainable farming (LISF) systems is likely to be realized at lower opportunity cost. Price or tax measures aimed at restricting agrichemical use seem not to be effective as might be expected. The policy measures making LISF practices more profitable may effectively motivate farmers to adopt these practices. A functional transition of regional farming service system from agrichemical-using to more environmentally sensitive practices is also required.

ID FOREST PRODUCTS; CERTIFICATION
AB International environmental groups propose to implement new standards of forest management through programs that certify producers who meet criteria to enhance biodiversity or sustainability. These producers could earn an "eco-label" that identifies their products for consumers. We consider whether a market economy might generate feedbacks that produce undesirable side effects as consumers respond to price changes. While the general case is ambiguous, the theoretical framework show the potential that certification may lead to a reallocation of land toward less ecologically sustainable uses, with the possibility of sufficient impact to diminish global biodiversity or sustainability of forest products.

AB The Norwegain mountains have had a central role in the subsistence agroecosystems by providing vast biological resources for humans and their livestock since 4000-3500 BP as indicated by paleoecological records. Later with the development of the summer farming system the use of the mountains was intensified. This long-term use of the mountains has shaped a montane cultural landscape by livestock grazing, mowing for hay, fuel collection and a variety of other uses. The result is a significant increase of the grassland areas at the expense of the forest. Those semi-natural grasslands and heathlands with specific biological diversity have until recently dominated the mountains but are today decreasing due to forest invasion - which in turn is a result of changes in human land use. The present paper focuses on changes in landscape pattern and differences in landscape development in two mountain valleys with summer farming activities, in Mid-Norway, over the period 1960s-1990s, and seeks to interpret the changes in relation to differential land use and environmental factors. This study contributes examples from human shaped ecosystems in mountains where the fragmentation of semi-natural habitats is addressed. A set of landscape pattern indices commonly used in landscape ecological studies is also used here, and their ecological relevance in the present context is dealt with. The implications of changed land use for biodiversity conservation in those mountains and the relationships to future sustainable agriculture is also briefly discussed.

TI Strategies for managing knowledge assets: the role of firm structure and
   industrial context
SO LONG RANGE PLANNING
LA English
DT Article
ID KNOW-HOW; TECHNOLOGY
AB In the new economy, the sustainable competitive advantage of business firms flows from the creation, ownership, protection and use of difficult-to-imitate commercial and industrial knowledge assets. Such assets include tacit and codified know-how, both technical and organisational, whether or not protected by the instruments of intellectual property such as trade secrets, copyrights and patents. Competitive advantage undergirded by such assets can be sustainable to the extent to which it is transferable and useable inside the firm, but difficult for outsiders to access and/or recreate. Knowledge management can be used to describe the panoply of procedures and techniques used to get the most from a firm's knowledge assets. information technology can assist knowledge management, but knowledge management involves much more than the astute use of IT tools. In particular, knowledge management requires the development of dynamic capabilities... the ability to sense and then seize opportunities quickly and proficiently. This is especially so in environments characterised by increasing returns, irrespective of the appropriability regime. Companies slow to respond to the new reality will be severely handicapped.

TI The future Israeli-Palestinian relationship
SO MIDDLE EAST POLICY
LA English
DT Article
AB In this concept paper, the Joint Working Group on Israeli-Palestinian Relations - a group of influential Palestinians and Israelis that has been meeting periodically since 1994 to discuss final-status issues in the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations - explores the future relationship between the two societies after the signing of a peace agreement. The paper considers a relationship based on total separation between the two societies and states as neither realistic nor desirable. Instead, it envisages a future relationship based on mutually beneficial cooperation in many spheres, conducive to stable peace, sustainable development, and ultimate reconciliation. The basis for such a relationship must be laid in the process and outcome of the final-status negotiations and in the patterns of cooperation established on the ground.
   Efforts at cooperation and reconciliation cannot be pursued apart from their political context. The paper argues that the only feasible political arrangement on which a cooperative relationship can be built is a two-state solution, establishing a genuinely independent Palestinian state alongside of Israel. The resolution of final-status issues must be consistent with the sovereignty, viability, and security of both states.
   The paper then proceeds to describe several models for the relationship between the two states and societies. It advocates a model of close cooperation, but proposes that this relationship be built in stages. The scope and speed of expanding and institutionalizing cooperative activities must be determined by experience - by the extent to which such activities meet the needs of both parties, enhance mutual trust, and reduce inequalities between the parties.
   Finally, the paper discusses three avenues for promoting a cooperative relationship based on equality, reciprocal benefit, and mutual trust and respect: the development of functional ties and civil-society institutions across national borders; programs directed toward attitude change and stereotype reduction; and efforts to close the economic and political gap between the two societies.

AB Slash-and-burn for pluvial rice cultivation (Tavy) is a predominant component in the land use system on the Eastern Escarpment of Madagascar. It causes ecological degradation and subsequent aggravation of rural poverty. After conducting multidisciplinary research resulting in an in depth diagnosis of the area's agroecological system, the BEMA (Bilans ecologiques a Madagascar) project now aims to propose improvements and alternatives to the land use system. The objective of contributing relevant knowledge to stakeholder discussions and enhancing the choice of development priorities has called for a method allowing aggregation of existing knowledge, in order to constitute an integrated overall picture of the local level. The present article illustrates the application of a sensitivity analysis. This method allows exploitation of existing knowledge with a view to setting priorities among key factors with regard to a postulated development objective and discussion of possible strategies for development activities. For this study, intensification and stabilization, which are common concerns among the region's stakeholders, were chosen as development objectives to be analyzed by example. Analysis of the local land use system has revealed that actions aiming to retard degradation caused by the slash-and-burn technique, as well as to promote self-sufficiency of Tavy, have hindered intensification and stabilization. This paper concludes that the key factors in promoting more sustainable development are the intensification and the spatial concentration of permanent crops (irrigated rice and home gardens), Gash cropping and animal husbandry on the valley floors. interventions at the socio-organizational level (collective conventions, improved access to land, etc.) and efforts to improve the dynamics of the focal market are the most important factors in inducing and perpetuating such changes.

   assessments; phytomass measurement; indigenous soil management
AB In the High Andes of Bolivia, sectoral fallow systems are a common form of land use. Fields in the study area (-lapo, Department of Cochabamba) are cultivated for 3 years with potatoes as the first crop and then lie fallow for 9 years. Despite the low nutrient content of the soil and the high elevation of the area (between 4000 and 4500 m above sea level), farmers achieve relatively high yields. This is explained by traditional knowledge about soil fertility management. The study focuses on nutrient dynamics over a 12-year cycle. A participatory research approach was applied to obtain information about indigenous knowledge. Soil nutrient content, phytomass, and yields were measured in 72 fields together with the farmers. Subterranean phytomass was identified as the key factor in nutrient storage during the fallow period. A multiple linear regression model shows three main factors that determine potato yields on cultivated fields. Farmers know about the nutrient dynamics of the fields; hence, cultivation measures show an impressive rationality. New elements such as mineral fertilizer have been incorporated in the system in a sustainable way. Participatory research intensifies these processes, stimulating farmers to reflect about their own land use system.

AB Nitrogen retention and release following the incorporation of cover crops and green manures were examined in field trials in NE Scotland. These treatments reduced the amounts of nitrate-N by between 10-20 kg ha(-1) thereby lowering the potential for leaching and gaseous N losses. However, uptake of N by overwintering crops was low, reflecting the short day-lengths and low soil temperatures associated with this part of Britain. Vegetation that had regenerated naturally was as effective as sown cover crops at taking up N over winter and in returning N to the soil for the following crop. Incorporation of residues generally resulted in lower mineralisation rates and reduced N2O emissions than the cultivation of bare ground, indicating a temporary immobilisation of soil N following incorporation. Emissions from incorporated cover crops ranged from 23-44 g N2O-N ha(-1) over 19 days, compared with 61 g N2O-N ha(-1) emitted from bare ground. Emissions from incorporated green manures ranged from 409-580 g N2O-N ha(-1) over 53 days with 462 g N2O-N ha(-1) emitted from bare ground. Significant positive correlations between N2O and soil NO3- after incorporation (r=0.8-0.9; P < 0.001 and r=0.1-0.4; P < 0.05 for cover crops and green manures, respectively) suggest that this N2O was mainly produced during nitrification. There was no significant effect of either cover cropping or green manuring on the N content or yield of the subsequent oats crop, suggesting that N was not sufficiently limiting in this soil for any benefits to become apparent immediately. However, benefits of increased sustainability as a result of increased organic matter concentrations may be seen in long-term organic rotations, and such systems warrant investigation.

AB Three field experiments were conducted in southwest and west-central Florida in 1993 through 1995 to evaluate the effectiveness of soil solarization during autumn in reducing Phytophthora blight of Madagascar periwinkle (Catharanthus roseus) caused by Phytophthora nicotianae. Plots (3.6 by 3.6 m) were infested by incorporating winter wheat seed containing P. nicotianae in the upper 15 cm of soil. Solarization was then conducted for 21 to 41 days, primarily during October, using clear, 25- or 50-mu m low-density polyethylene mulch. The progress of Phytophthora blight, monitored for 31 to 42 days following planting, was significantly reduced by solarization in all experiments, and final blight incidence was reduced in two of three experiments. Solarization also reduced population densities of P. nicotianae.

AB The Montreal Process indicators are intended to provide a common framework for assessing and reviewing progress toward sustainable forest management. The potential of a combined geometrical-optical/spectral mixture analysis model was assessed for mapping the Montreal Process age class and successional age indicators at a regional scale using Landsat Thematic data. The project location is an area of eucalyptus forest in Emu Creek State Forest, Southeast Queensland, Australia. A quantitative model relating the spectral reflectance of a forest to the illumination geometry, slope, and aspect of the terrain surface and the size, shape, and density, and canopy size. Inversion of this model necessitated the use of spectral mixture analysis to recover subpixel information on the fractional extent of ground scene elements (such as sunlit canopy, shaded canopy, sunlit background, and shaded background). Results obtained fron a sensitivity analysis allowed improved allocation of resources to maximize the predictive accuracy of the model. It was found that modeled estimates of crown cover projection, canopy size, and tree densities had significant agreement with field and air photo-interpreted estimates. However, the accuracy of the successional stage classification was limited. The results obtained highlight the potential for future integration of high and moderate spatial resolution-imaging sensors for monitoring forest structure and condition.

AB This study categorizes different subsistence and commercial uses of resources and quantifies the amount of wood used for firewood and building poles within an eastern Tanzanian miombo woodland site. Data from questionnaire surveys were collected from 80 households sampled from two villages. Firewood was used solely at the subsistence level by 96% of the population, with a per capita consumption of 1.5 +/- 0.17 (SE) m(3) year(-1), whereas building poles were not only used at subsistence level but were partly commercialised in the informal market. Per capita consumption of wood for building poles was 0.138 +/- 0.01 m(3) year(-1), based on an average house life-span of eight years. Timber and charcoal production were the most commercialised resources. Shifting cultivation, which is undertaken in the majority of the areas cleared for charcoal, is practiced by 68% of the population while permanent cropping is practiced by 32% of the population. Both farming systems predominantly comprise mono-cropping and mixed-cropping of cereals with bean crops. Shifting cultivation changes vegetation structure from woodlands to bushlands because of a short fallow period of only four years after continuous farming for about six years. Current levels of subsistence use of firewood and poles appear to be sustainable, but levels of shifting cultivation are not. However, selection of favoured species for building poles often leads to over-exploitation, especially when these species are inherently scarce.

AB Accurate, up-to-date information on land cover and land-use is essential for strategic planning, sustainable resource management and environmental research. A land-cover database for South Africa, Swaziland and Lesotho, designed for use in a variety of regional modelling, monitoring and analytical endeavours, has been created. Database development involved (1) a stratification of natural land cover and human land-use, (2) a contextual classification of hardcopy multispectral data derived from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery collected from 1994 to 1996, and (3) a stratified post-classification accuracy assessment using a large sample of field data. The resultant database has yielded substantial information to characterize the landscapes of South Africa. The analysis uses data recorded by province, primary hydrological catchment and vegetation biome to explore the land-cover characteristics of South Africa, Swaziland and Lesotho. Aggregated results show that South Africa comprises the following general surface types: 5.8% forest and woodland; 0.3% forest; 17.6% thicket and bushland; 34.1% shrubland and low fynbos; 0.2% herbland; 21.3% grassland; 12.2% cultivated lands; 1.5% forest plantations; 0.4% waterbodies; 0.5% wetlands; 0.2% barren rock; 4.9% degraded lands; 1.1% urban/built-up lands; and 0.14% mines and quarries. The accuracy of the database ranges from 51% to 93%, depending on geographical area, with corresponding kappa index values from 35 to 88.

AB The paper outlines the experience and performance of a community-focused land management and agroforestry project (the Upland Settlement Project or USP) in the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) region in south-eastern Bangladesh. The project attempts to 'rehabilitate and develop' some impoverished indigenous ethnic people, who have hitherto been engaged in shifting cultivation The paper sheds light on the nature, organization and achievements of the project. Of late, the upland ethnic communities have received increased attention from development academics and activists alike.
   The USP, administered by the Chittagong Hill Tracts Development Board, has been found to be reasonably appropriate and acceptable to participating farming families. One thousand families from four ethnic communities have been resettled. Each family has received ownership title to land, with a view to developing it through integrated homestead agroforestry and rubber plantations, and all necessary community facilities and services were also provided.
   To evaluate the performance of the programme, a survey was conducted through a semi-structured questionnaire (complemented by observation and ethno-histories). Major problems observed during the course of fieldwork included the inadequate and delayed release of funds, marginal participation of women in the project meetings, lack of base-line socio-economic, demographic and topographic information and the project staff's limited exposure to participatory working style. Despite the limitations, however, the majority of the participating families expressed their general satisfaction about their present level of participation in the project.

DT Article
AB Micro-enterprise efforts have focused mainly on economic development, although ignoring the social and environmental consequences can jeopardize success. This essay examines the characteristics of successful groups and the barriers they face. The lessons learned from successful micro-enterprises suggest that the key is to bring together the elements of sustainable development with the importance of the key fact that the micro-enterprises are community based. The thesis proposed is that micro-enterprises can foster sustainable development if, and only if, they are integrated in a view of community development that links the social, economic and environmental dimensions.

TI The employment implications of a low-carbon economy
SO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID ENVIRONMENT; EUROPE
AB The threat of global warming and unacceptable levels of unemployment are two items high on policy agendas in the 1990s. Increasing emphasis on 'sustainable development' ensures that debate surrounding the relationship between jobs and the environment is kept under the research microscope. In the past, the supposed incompatibility of environmental protection and employment was a fairly deep-rooted and Little-contested belief. However, recent 'revisionist' thinking has spotlighted discrepancies with this traditional economic approach. Increasingly, environmental economic literature cites the relationship between the two as positive, with careful policy implementation enabling mutual reinforcement. This paper details the background to the 'jobs versus environment' debate, providing a summary of the latest literature and assessing the prospects for increased employment in a low-carbon economy.

TI Project procurement systems in the attainment of sustainable
   construction
SO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB The construction industry makes a vital contribution to the social and economic development of every country, but, at the same time, its building sector has major impacts on the environment. Construction is a major consumer of non-renewable resources (energy in particular), a substantial source of waste, a polluter of air and water and an important contributor to land dereliction. This paper focuses specifically on the growing lack of focus on construction sustainability in the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) public building sector. It indicates some salient issues on sustainable construction and the need for appropriate procurement systems, using the Botswana public building sector as a case study. It addresses two propositions. First that Lack of appropriate focus on sustainable construction is primarily due to an inappropriate project organizational structure. Second that a default traditional construction procurement system (TCPS) provides a poor relationship management system incapable of dealing with sustainability parameters. Information is obtained through questionnaires on the dominant procurement system used. The primary conclusion is that the building procurement system apparently in use in the SADC public building sector differs significantly from that recommended in the theory, resulting in insignificant focus on construction sustainability. Salient steps are proposed with a proviso that the SADC public building sector should establish appropriate methods of selecting building procurement systems and formulate appropriate project organizational structures that will embrace an environmental management system.

TI Principles, policies and practice: Evaluating the environmental
   sustainability of Britain's packaging regulations
SO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB This paper examines recent developments in the UK packaging regulations, legislation transposing the European Union Packaging Waste Directive (94/62/EC). It explores the way in which the UK regulations have adopted market-based environmental policies, including the use of economic instruments. The environmental benefits gained from the market-based approach are assessed against the policy principles adopted within the EU environmental programme. The study finds evidence that UK policy is moving towards greater adherence to these principles engineered by a combination of market factors and government intervention. Nonetheless, certain elements of the market show fewer signs of developing environmentally sustainable structures, with little evidence of sustained demand for recycled packaging and considerable uncertainty over levels of public awareness. The government must therefore play a leading role in honing policies if the regulations are to fulfil the EU's policy principles more fully in the future.

TI Structural changes in developing countries and their implication for

SO TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE
LA English
DT Article
AB The concept of "structural shifts" has various meanings. In this study, we discuss structural shifts as they relate to the issue of climate change. The concept of "Sustainable Development" is emerging as one of the major challenges for economic development. Although the 20th century has generally been recognized as the era of "competition of ideologies," it is widely believed that the new international economic order of the 21st century will emerge under the paradigm of sustainable development. In this sense, structural shifts may be redefined for both developed and developing countries. To envisage shifts in the next century, several key driving forces must be considered. First is the utilization of the natural endowments of a country, including climate and natural resources. Second is the size of land and population, population growth trends, and population composition. Patterns of urbanization, economic, and industrial structures, technological diffusion, and institutional and legal mechanisms are closely related to the patterns and strategies for economic development in each country as part of the new international economic order. We assess the dynamics of structural shifts through the interaction of all these driving forces. This paper examines historical development patterns and common features of developed countries to analyze both developed and developing countries' future adaptation processes to the new global concerns of climate change.

TI Development assistance on the brink
SO THIRD WORLD QUARTERLY
LA English
DT Article
ID WELFARE-STATE; INSTITUTIONS; AID
AB The international aid regime is currently faced with a major paradox. On the one hand, officials in bilateral and multlateral agencies increasingly agree that 'aid matters' and can contribute significantly to development. This confidence has been reinforced by the fact that, after a decade dominated by the objective of structural adjustment, the much less controversial one of sustainable development has taken over as the new mantra of aid policies. On the other hand, development assistance appears to be a declining priority for foreign policy-makers in the developed countries. The generosity of donors has diminished to the point that aid reached an all-time low in 1997. The aim of this article is to make sense of this paradox. After examining the grounds for optimism within the aid community, the article then explains why there is reason to doubt that foreign assistance can effectively foster sustainable development over the course of the next generation.

AB The process of neoliberal globalisation has been associated with successive financial crises in the context of the 1990s, raising serious doubts concerning the sustainability of rapid growth in an environment of uncontrolled movements of short-term capital. The article probes into the origins of the financial crises in the semi-periphery through a structured comparison of three key recent crises in the world economy, namely the Mexican and Turkish crises of 1994 and the Asian crises of 1997. Whilst the magnitude of the capital flows and the dimensions of the subsequent crises are strikingly different, there are nonetheless important elements common to all three cases studied. One such common element involves the overdependence of the countries concerned on the short-term financial flows, in a setting characterised by premature capital account liberalisation in the absence of adequate regulation. It is striking that, contrary to the conventional IMF wisdom, financial crises have occurred in spite of 'sound fundamental', namely fiscal equilibrium and low inflation. The recent financial crises highlights a paradoxical situation: the need for effective regulation at a time when the capacity of the nation state to undertake the type of regulation needed severely circumscribed. Hence, the establishment of an effective regulatory framework at the global level emerges as a major requirement if successive financial crises, with significant economic and social cost, are to be avoided in the future.

AB Although research to date has addressed various elements of destination competitiveness there has been little attempt to systematically and comprehensively study the environmental competitiveness from the managerial perspective. Since the Calgary tourism competitiveness model brought a systematic approach to tourism competitiveness research, this paper selectively uses its management element as a tool to link the competitiveness and environmental management. Following the model the destination management is divided into two parts: (1) managerial and (2) marketing efforts. This paper studies them from environmental perspective, First, destination environmental competitiveness can be increased by appropriate managerial efforts related to environmental impact (EI), and environmental quality (EQ) management. Second, the destination competitiveness can be enhanced through certain environmental marketing activities. Further, environmental management is categorised into groups: management by codes of conduct, by self-developed environmental practice, by certified or awarded best practice and by accreditation schemes. Their usefulness for environmental destination management and competitiveness is evaluated. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID POLICY
AB This paper develops a framework within which multiple agents make discrete choices in respect of a common objective - the determination of participation in distributed work, especially the opportunities and constraints associated with telecommuting. Ideas in discrete choice theory and game theory are combined to define a set of choice experiments in which employees and employers interact in arriving at a choice path in a distributed work context. A state choice experiment with offers and feedback, known as an interactive agency choice experiment (IACE), is empirically investigated in the context of telecommuting options with an exploratory sample of employees and employers in Sydney, Australia. The approach highlights the role of information and negotiation in breaking down the barriers to more flexible work activity, to deliver potential benefits to the transport system such as reduced traffic congestion and environmental sustainability. The paper identifies the types of incentives that an employee/er has to offer the employer/employee in securing effective telecommuting.

AB Australia has exhibited a remarkably stable home-ownership rate of 70 per cent for over thee decades. However, this paper questions whether this rate is sustainable. Decomposition techniques based on tenure choice models are used to provide evidence of changing homeownership patterns in Australia between 1975 and 1994, The results indicate a distinct change in home-ownership propensities which is neither uniform across age-groups, nor uniform for different household types with both the same and with different levels of income. A number of tentative explanations are proposed, each of which provides the basis for further research on the factors affecting household tenure decisions. This is essential if the potential for a significant decline in home-ownership is to be seen as a matter of concern.

AB With the rapid growth of the electronics industry and an ever-growing environmental awareness world-wide, an environmentally sound and economically viable management system for end-of-life (EOL) electric and electronic equipment (EEE) is of great importance for sustainable development. Traditional recycling and processing of EOL electronics directed towards the recovery of copper and precious metals, will be faced with many challenges in the future. It has been recognized by the EOL EEE recycling industry that a new strategy for EOL EEE must be developed. In this paper, current status and future trends in EOL EEE management are presented. Selective dismantling of valuable and hazardous components is evaluated in terms of a grade-recovery (GR) concept. It is concluded that selective dismantling and mechanical processing must be coordinated in such a way as to produce suitable materials for subsequent handling at the lowest cost. Furthermore, new developments in mechanical and thermal processing of EOL EEE are also discussed, which involve water table and eddy current separation techniques and reduction of dioxins and furans during combustion of the plastics containing halogenated flame retardants. In addition, the challenges and perspectives associated with EOL management of plastics and cathode ray tubes (CRTs) encountered in EOL EEE are highlighted in this paper. It is predicted that EEE, being designed for recycling in the 21st century, will be processed and recycled economically and ecologically on becoming obsolete.

   water resources
ID SAUDI-ARABIA; GULF REGION; HYDROGEOLOGY
AB One of the critical problems that hinders the sustainable development in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries is the lack of renewable water resources. Rainfall in the Arabian Peninsula is scarce and infrequent. Over-exploitation of fossil groundwater resources, mostly to meet the irrigation demands and create greenery lands, has already affected the aquifer's productivity both quantitatively and qualitatively. A great portion of the freshwater demands in the GCC countries is covered by desalinated water. Recently, after the Gulf war and uncertainty of oil prices, the expansion in the construction of desalination plants may not be economically feasible. This article investigates the water availability and assesses the water demands in the GCC countries. It emphasizes the need for the adaptation of an efficient and integrated policy for water utilization and application of relevant conservation techniques in various water consumption sectors. Water of higher quality should be preserved for drinking purposes and should not be utilized for other purposes that may tolerate water of lower quality. Recycling of water and artificial recharge of groundwater by surface water and treated wastewater should be adapted at a larger scale.

AB We construct a theoretical framework that describes the social worth of a microfinance organization in terms of the depth, worth to users, cost to users, breadth, length, and scope of its output. We then analyze evidence of depth of outreach for five microfinance organizations in Bolivia. Most of the poor households reached by the microfinance organizations were near the poverty line-they were the richest of the poor. Group lenders had more depth of outreach than individual lenders. The urban poorest were more likely to be borrowers, but rural borrowers were more likely to be among the poorest. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Degradation of the global environment and depletion of resources are threatening sustainable development of mankind. In particular, climate change caused by increasing greenhouse gases is one of the most serious issues in analyzing energy systems. This paper aims at proposing frameworks to investigate sustainability and at evaluating technologies for sustainable energy systems. For this purpose, we first define the index of sustainable limits on resource depletion and emissions. Sustainability of mineral and energy resources is evaluated based on the index. Estimations indicate that energy resources and CO2 are unsustainable, and that we should introduce technologies to reduce energy consumption and CO2 emissions. Life cycle energy requirements are assessed for photovoltaic systems as representatives of the technologies. Through the life cycle assessment, we quantitatively evaluate measures to improve life cycle energy requirements and capital costs. At the same time, we clarify the direction of research and development required for technologies to realize sustainable energy systems. (C) 1999 Scripta Technica.

TI Rainfall and drought in equatorial east Africa during the past 1,100
   years
SO NATURE
LA English
DT Article
ID LAKE-LEVEL; CLIMATE; KENYA
AB Knowledge of natural long-term rainfall variability is essential for water-resource and land-use management in sub-humid regions of the world. In tropical Africa, data relevant to determining this variability are scarce because of the lack of long instrumental climate records and the limited potential of standard high-resolution proxy records such as tree rings and ice cores(1-3). Here we present a decade-scale reconstruction of rainfall and drought in equatorial east Africa over the past 1,100 years, based on lake-level and salinity fluctuations of Lake Naivasha (Kenya) inferred from three different palaeolimnological proxies: sediment stratigraphy and the species compositions of fossil diatom and midge assemblages. Our data indicate that, over the past millennium, equatorial east Africa has alternated between contrasting climate conditions, with significantly drier climate than today during the 'Medieval Warm Period' (similar to AD 1000-1270) and a relatively wet climate during the 'Little ice Age' (similar to AD 1270-1850) which was interrupted by three prolonged dry episodes. We also find strong chronological links between the reconstructed history of natural long-term rainfall variation and the pre-colonial cultural history of east Africa(4), highlighting the importance of a detailed knowledge of natural long-term rainfall fluctuations for sustainable socio-economic development.

AB Objective To evaluate the effectiveness of an educational intervention in adolescent health designed for general practitioners in accordance with evidence based practice in continuing medical education.
   Design Randomised controlled trial with baseline testing and follow up at seven and 13 months.
   Setting Local communities in metropolitan Melbourne, Australia.
   Participants 108 self selected general practitioners.
   Intervention A multifaceted educational programme for 2.5 hours a week over six weeks on the principles of adolescent health care followed six weeks later by a two hour session of case discussion and debriefing.
   Outcome measures Objective ratings of consultations with standardised adolescent patients recorded on videotape. Questionnaires completed by the general practitioners were used to measure their knowledge, skill, and self perceived competency, satisfaction with the programme, and self reported change in practice.
   Results 103 of 108 (95%) doctors completed all phases of the intervention and evaluation protocol. The intervention group showed significantly greater improvements in all outcomes than the control group at the seven month follow up except for the rapport and satisfaction rating by the standardised patients. 104 (96%) participants found the programme appropriate and relevant At the 13 month follow up most improvements were sustained, the confidentiality rating by the standardised patients decreased slightly, and the objective assessment of competence further improved. 106 (98%) participants reported a change in practice attributable ts the intervention.
   Conclusions General practitioners were willing to complete continuing medical education in adolescent health care and its evaluation, The design of the intervention using evidence based educational strategies proved an effective and quick way to achieve sustainable and large improvements in knowledge, skill, and self perceived competency.

AB Strategies proposed for delaying resistance to Bacillus thuringiensis toxins expressed by transgenic maize require intense gene flow between individuals that grew on transgenic and on normal (referred to as refuges) plants. To investigate gene flow in the European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis (Hubner), the genetic variability at 29 sampled sites from France was studied by comparing allozyme frequencies at six polymorphic loci. Almost no deviations from Hardy-Weinberg expectations occurred, and a high stability of allelic distribution was found among samples collected in the same site over two or three different generations, indicating a high stability of the genetic structure over time. The overall genetic differentiation was low at the region and whole country level, suggesting a high and homogeneous gene flow. These results are discussed in relation to the sustainability of transgenic insecticidal maize.

AB The work of the Betriebsforschungsinstitut (BFI) is characterised by production-oriented research and development, and their direct application to the benefits of companies in the steel industry. This national and international co-operative research, the results of which are available to all, is suitable complemented by contract research and engineering services for individual enterprises. In the fields of energy and process technology, BFI activities focus essentially on the application and combination of basic processes, their further development or first innovative introduction for efficiency improvements in the companies, covering all production areas of the complete process route from raw materials to the final product. The article presents examples of development activities in the BFI competence fields about fluid dynamics of liquid steel in tundishes and continuous casting moulds, about heat, firing, combustion and gas technologies in the sintering process, in industrial furnaces and heat recovery plants with coupled gas utilisation as well as about water, resources utilisation and recycling technologies for processing baths, pickling acid regenerations, emulsions and reconditioning of metal/oil sludges and other residues.
   These activities result in process technological improvements and innovations for steel-relevant processes and equipments, all of which bring about production improvements and, finally, cost reductions. These developments substantially contribute to sustainable improvements in quality, productivity, efficiency and/or energy utilisation, to reductions in the amount of gaseous, liquid and solid wastes and by-products as well as to the closing of process circuit gaps, and the protection of natural resources and the environment.

AB The profession of medicine faces unprecedented pressures that jeopardize physicians' ability to care for patients. This is the perfect time for physicians to look back at the history of medicine; examine our own personal journeys; and reflect on our ideals, commitments, and accomplishments.
   To be effective leaders for medicine and health, physicians must work together. We must be vigilant about threats to high standards, research, education, and ethics and seize opportunities for improvement. We need to ensure that relationships with patients, students and housestaff, and other colleagues are marked by trust and healing. The days, years, and careers that we spend caring for others are most sustainable and satisfying if we also care for ourselves and our families,
   Many elements are required for physicians to maintain the lifegiving capabilities of our profession. Principles and thought combined with action have carried and buoyed medicine throughout time. This must not change.
