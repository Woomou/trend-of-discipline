AB The challenge for the civil engineering community in the near future will he to realize projects in harmony with the concept of sustainable development, and this involves the use of high-performance materials produced at reasonable cost with the lowest possible environmental impact.
   Portland cement concrete is a major construction material worldwide. Unfortunately, the production of portland cement releases large amounts of CO(2) into the atmosphere, and because this gas is a major contributor to the greenhouse effect and the global warming of the planet, the developed countries are considering very severe regulations and limitations on the CO(2) emissions.
   In view of the global sustainable development, if is imperative that supplementary cementing materials be used to replace large proportions of cement in the concrete industry, and the mob available supplementary cementing material worldwide is fly ash, a by-product of thermal power stations. To considerably increase the utilization of fly ash that ts otherwise being wasted, and to have a significant impact on the production of cement, it is necessary to advocate the use of concrete that will incorporate large amounts of fly ash as a replacement for cement. Such concrete, however, must demonstrate performance comparable to that of conventional portland cement concrete, and must be cost effective.
   In 1985, CANMET developed a concrete incorporating large volumes of fly ash that has all the attributes of high-performance concrete, that is, one that has excellent mechanical properties, low permeability superior durability, and that is environmentally friendly. This paper gives an overview of the properties of this type of concrete that is believed to be a very promising alternative for the industry seeking to meet the sustainable development objectives.

TI Socio-ecological strategies for future sustainability - A review of an

LA English
DT Article
AB The recent upsurge in information technology has provided the international community with an easy access to professional journals (e.g. Electronic journal of Biotechnology at http://www.ejb.org; etc.), discussion groups (e.g. bioenergy@crest.org; digestion@crest.org; etc.) and recently to electronic international conferences (e.g. ICIBS; http://www.cid.harvard.edu/cidbiotech, etc.) as well as a series of biotechnological information material (e.g. http://www.Dsrast.org, etc.) to stay in contact and receive up-to-date information in biotechnology. There is no doubt that this new technology will be more cost effective in future and reach more people in communities around the globe. This review reports on one such an electronic conference aiming at bridging the communication gap between developed and developing countries. This conference dealt with integrated biosystems and has provided an excellent forum for more than 100 active participants from all regions of the world. As has been demonstrated in this review, the conference was able to show the very different approaches towards the use of biotechnology in developed and developing countries, cold and tropical climate regions owing to their different ecological, economical and societal problems. It also demonstrated very clearly that the field of molecular genetics and/or genetic engineering is not a priority issue in developing countries, but rather the need for clean technologies, multiproduct formation through socio-economic integrated biosystems, e.g. incorporating microbial waste management into agro-industries, in human activities and their roles in creating better health conditions, a better environment and sustain development. It is hoped that this review will lead to a greater use of the electronic facilities available to inform and educate both the northern and the southern communities more readily of their needs and requirements to improve understanding and efforts for a sustainable future.

TI Scientific methodology for complex systems: Macroscopic patterns in eco-
   and anthropo-sphere
SO ACTA BIOTECHNOLOGICA
LA English
DT Article
ID FORMAL MACROAPPROACH; ANALOGIES; STRATEGY
AB A quite unconventional, innovative scientific methodology called "macroscopic pattern analysis" is presented in this paper. This approach is more adequate in the case of complex systems than the well-known microscopic, mechanistic approach. Complex systems are not only attracting more engineering interest, but their scientific treatment is increasingly wanted by society due to the manifold problems in Earth's ecosphere. The macroscopic pattern approach will be explained in depth and illustrated in some case studies from the ecosphere (sustainability, hurricanes and avalanches), where nature serves as a teacher for the solution of the sustainability problem. Then, a series of case studies on macropatterns are described showing the problem-solving capacity for anthropo- and technosphere: sustainability in society with an index of sustainability, the eco-social market economy with eco-tech as an instrument, biokinetics, bioreactor mixing and integrated bioprocessing with models, design of cars and houses and even quality of life as an attempt to quantify macropatterns. The innovations are briefly compared in their problem-solving capacity with known approaches such as the microscopic method in science, technology and society (free market economy), including the evaluation of other indices and cleaner production, industrial ecology and zero emission initiative. Finally, a deeper integration of sciences, ethics, arts and nature will be introduced based on the vision with macroscopic pattern analysis, where the different domains of human life are integratable to effect a reconciliation.

TI Action as a dynamic property of the genotype x environment interaction
   implications for biotechnology
SO ACTA BIOTECHNOLOGICA
LA English
DT Article
AB The action resonance theory (ART), a hypothesis based on a logical extension of EINSTEIN's theory of Brownian movement, suggests that the genotype x environment interaction can be modelled as forceful encounters of the gene-products of an organism with its environment. This model has implications for molecular and cell biology, morphogenesis, evolutionary development via mutation, the mechanism of natural selection and overall function of ecosystems, extending SCHRODINGER's programme for molecular biology. Action, a thermodynamic property with the same physical dimensions as angular momentum and PLANCK's quantum of action, is proposed to be reversibly generated as a result of the molecular exchange of quanta, which become resonant at equilibrium, corresponding to an optimum degree of entropy and action for living systems. Because the theory can potentially predict solutions to unsolved problems such as the folding of proteins it has strong implications for successful genetic modification of organisms and for biotechnology in general; the design of a programme of research to test this theory is proposed. A key element in this research programme, improving productivity and sustainability, would be the need to select genetically modified strains in the ecological environment or niche in which they are required to function.

AB This work presents a specific stock-effort dynamical model. The stocks correspond to two populations of fish moving and growing between two fishery zones. They are harvested by two different fleets. The effort represents the number of fishing boats of the two fleets that operate in the two fishing nones. The bioeconomical model is a set of four ODE's governing the fishing efforts and the stocks in the two fishing areas. Furthermore, the migration of the fish between the two patches is assumed to be faster than the growth of the harvested stock. The displacement of the fleets is also faster than the variation in the number of fishing boats resulting from the investment of the fishing income. So, there are two time scales: a fast one corresponding to the migration between the two patches, and a slow time scale corresponding to growth. We use aggregation methods that allow us to reduce the dimension of the model and to obtain an aggregated model for the total fishing effort and fish stock of the two fishing zones. The mathematical analysis of the model is shown. Under some conditions, we obtain a stable equilibrium, which is a desired situation, as it leads to a sustainable harvesting equilibrium, keeping the stock at exploitable densities.

AB Several biological and ecological characteristics of Galium minutulum Jordan, a rare steno-mediterranean annual species, were investigated on some populations of the Hyeres islands, which are located in the north-eastern limit of the species distribution. The objectives of this study were to better document distribution, autecology and the form of rarity of this species in Provence and to propose accordingly some elements for a sustainable management of that vulnerable taxa. Galium minutulum exhibits a noteworthy polymorphism and an important ecological plasticity, which were both mostly explained by the existence of two allopatric cytotypes. Tetraploid individuals, small-sized and spindly, are located in the core-areas of the biggest islands (Porquerolles, Port-Cros, Le Levant), at the edges of the sclerophyllous matorrals or the thermophilous holm-oak forest. Hexaploids, more robust, grow on the coastal habitats directly exposed to sea sprays, notably on the smallest islands (Bagaud, Grand Ribaud). Many factors such as meiosis abnormalities, reduction of germination capacity of the tetraploid cytotype, frequent infestations of a pathogene fungus (blight), and the sensitive locations near the tracks and paths, generate several threats on this species and contribute to its rarity.

AB Crop simulation models are valuable research tools in agricultural decision making. In order to increase its general applicability, models need to be evaluated in diverse conditions. To achieve this, CROPGRO-Soybean model was evaluated on Vertic Inceptisols in a climatically variable semi-arid tropical condition. The model predicted reasonably the temporal changes in leaf area index, biomass and grain yield. The model was used to develop yield-evapotranspiration (ET) relationship, and to assess the influence of soil water-storage capacity on yield. Yield was linearly related to ET and was reduced non-linearly as soil depth decreased. The yield reduction was minimal when depth decreased from 90 to 67 cm but severe reduction occurred when depth decreased below 45. cm. There exists a threshold soil depth (37 cm), below which crop productivity in Vertic Inceptisols cannot be sustained, even in good rainfall years. There is an urgent need to develop sustainable natural resource management technology to prevent further degradation of Vertic Inceptisol. CROPGRO-Soybean model can be successfully used as a research tool to evaluate the risks associated in adapting such technologies. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd, All rights reserved.

AB In an EU concerted action a checklist with criteria for the development of sustainable rural landscape was created. The idea of the concerted action was to bring together experts from various disciplines involved in management of the countryside. They represented disciplines from beta, gamma and alpha oriented sciences, ranging form environmentalists over sociologists to cultural geographers. They were all asked to list their (discipline's) criteria and parameters for a sustainable management of the landscape. From all these criteria and parameters a checklist has been established. This checklist is presented in this paper, accompanied by an explanation of its basic concept that draws upon Maslow, its context, its methodology and its use. Finally summaries an presented of the ways the checklist, in various stages of its development, has been used in several European country countrysides. It can be concluded that the checklist is a useful tool for valuing the contribution of farms viz. farming systems to the regional development and the sustainability of the landscape. It was found that organic farms included in the sample of our research often performed rather well in that perspective as compared to the non-organic farms in that region.

ID LANDSCAPE
AB Sustainability may be regarded as one of the most challenging and, at the same time, most fuzzy contemporary paradigms. In the present study, referring to the history of other leading ideas, this confusion is identified as a typical feature of young paradigms with a particular danger of misuse and destruction of the idea. Requirements necessary to save and evolve the paradigm of sustainability are identified. It is shown that help cannot be expected in the phrasing of a generally accepted definition. As an alternative, it is proposed to focus on the assessment procedure, where quantitative or qualitative value measures of the paradigm are developed for particular situations.
   The present study intends (i) to clarify the logic and terminology of the assessment process in general, (ii) to provide an effective assessment concept for sustainability in the field of agricultural land-use, and (iii) to demonstrate possible perspectives for rural planning practices.
   The first part displays fundamental aspects of valuation theory. The methodology of explicit assessment is introduced and described as a heuristic procedure, evolving the meaning of a term or paradigm in a socio-cultural discourse and in relation with practical experience. In the second part, focusing on sustainability assessment, the terminology, steps and elements of the general assessment procedure are defined on behalf of the assessment of land-use sustainability as an example. The iterative procedure allows developing quantitative and/or qualitative value measures for particular situations. The central element of the method is a hierarchically structured collection of viewpoints, called checklist of criteria. In a holistic, comprehensive approach towards sustainability ('strong' sustainability), five principal criteria are recommended for consideration: (i) abiotic environment; (ii) biotic environment, including animal welfare; (iii) cultural values, defined as human emotional and mental well being and creativity of society; (iv) sociology; and (v) economy. To each principal criterion, a hierarchical list of important sub-criteria is added. For the project-specific selection of suitable sub-criteria guidelines are described in detail. The result is an individual assessment system adapted to the natural, cultural, political and economic basic conditions of a given project. In the third part, the example of a Swiss land-use planning project shows the implementation of the methodology in practice and its benefits, e.g., the improvement of the communication within the project, or the promotion of an effective, goal-oriented planning procedure, as a basic tool for valuation, communication, planning, implementation and monitoring of sustainability in the field of agriculturally based land-use systems.

AB For a very long time, agricultural policy has been interested only in productive or economic aspects. Nevertheless, interventions aiming to support farmers' income or to promote agricultural: modernisation have resulted in several 'negative' side-effects, such as increasing pollution, landscape depletion and deepening of regional disparities. Consequently, a need has emerged for confronting problems with a more comprehensive approach, taking into account the whole range of impacts caused by agriculture. The European Concerted Action on 'Landscape and Nature Production Capacity of Sustainable/Organic Farms' has proposed a checklist of criteria for sustainable landscape management. This article discusses procedures for summarising the above-mentioned criteria in an 'overall judgement'. The aim is to provide a tool capable to assess farm performance taking into account all the relevant impacts of farm activities.
   Firstly, the paper discusses issues related to information quality, focussing on the differences in procedures for processing quantitative and qualitative data. Secondly, the article analyses methods suitable for reaching an overall judgement based on several criteria. Thereafter, it discusses their application to a set of case study farms or to farm typologies, which can be obtained by processing data from statistics or ad hoc surveys. Advantages and drawbacks of the use of case studies and farm typologies are given while their integrated use is recommended.
   Two types of methodologies are presented. The first methodology, to be preferred if time, information or financial resources are not lacking, transforms initial information into Utility values and processes the latter by using more sophisticated techniques, such as multiple criteria analysis. The second uses a simplified: approach, transforming initial data on the base of quartiles and then summing them up without any weighting. The advantages of this method are an easy implementation and a methodology that can be understood by decision-makers and administrators, who do not have a background in statistics.
   Conclusions stress the importance of a more comprehensive approach in setting agricultural policies, since fanning activity influences landscape and environment quality besides other important features. From this viewpoint, decision-makers have to be able to foresee the whole range of effects induced from policy, to avoid 'unexpected side-effects'. Regarding Landscape Management, interventions aiming to promote the introduction or reintroduction of single landscape elements can give different results from those that were expected. Consequently, subsidising farm typologies or styles of farming that have been proved to have a positive effect on landscape could be a more reliable approach. Farm typologies or styles of farming to be promoted could be selected on the base of their 'social' performance, assessed according to a multi-dimensional approach as the one presented in this article.

AB Criteria and parameters for the evaluation of sound rural landscapes presented in the list worked out in the EU-concerted action 'The nature and landscape production potentials of sustainable/organic types of agriculture' (third version, November 1995) are checked in two Tuscan organic farms. The first farm is located in the landscape system of the Coastal Plains in the Province of Grosseto, southern Tuscany. The second one is located in the landscape system of the Pliocene Hills in the Province of,Florence, central Tuscany. Referring to the 'Checklist for sustainable landscape management' as presented by Stobbelaar and Van Mansvelt (1994), some comments are given on the criteria and parameters proposed and on the method used for computing values in the evaluation (see Tellarini and Caporali, 2000). The evaluation that results confirms that organic farms in both areas add a considerable number of values to the surrounding landscape, ranging from a clean environment, a diverse agro-ecosystem, multiple social and economic functions and a coherently diversified landscape.

AB Two organic farms were evaluated on their landscape value in abroad perspective and compared with the surrounding non-organic farms. Therefore, a checklist with abiotic, social and cultural criteria was used. Firstly, an overview of the qualities of the Cretan landscape is given, which secondly, gives a framework to determine in how far the farms contribute to the landscape qualities. Thirdly, the scoring of the two described organic farms are compared with each other. This leads to the conclusion that the larger organic farm performs better than the smaller, especially concerning the abiotic environment. The cause of this difference in landscape performance may lie in the different social organisation of the two farms, However, when comparing the two farms with the (conventional) surrounding, both farms perform pretty well.

AB Use and characteristics of the minor rural road network have changed dramatically in West-European intensive agricultural landscapes. These changes are caused by modern agriculture, by changing values of the road's verges and by the multifunctionalization of the rural landscape. Changing the network, conventional fanning practices often decrease landscape ecological stability. These problems can be tackled by managing the road-verge network as an integrated subsystem of the landscape. A multifunctional management can reconcile transport, biological and recreational functions of the rural road-verge network. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Different levels of biodiversity - species, biotopes and landscapes - can be differentiated and used for the assessment of the biotic environment of organic farms. Could the integration of species diversity into the cultivated land be a task for organic farming in the future? For hundreds of years agriculture supported the enrichment and the diversification of the vegetation in Central Europe. Nowadays many landscape elements are no more than relies of historical land use. Todays' intensive agriculture is considered to be the main agent responsible for the decline of plant species, What are the effects of sustainable ways of agriculture on biodiversity, especially on the diversity of arable field plants? Many investigations show positive effects of organic agriculture on the diversity of arable fields and grassland, too. A higher number of species and also more endangered 'red list' species are to be found in organic fields, Different effects of agricultural practices in organic fanning on the weed flora are discussed.
   Today economic pressure leads to an improvement in mechanical weed control and undersowing, This shows that the aim of preserving, supporting and developing a diverse arable field flora cannot be reached automatically by converting to organic fanning: an integration with the guiding image of organic agriculture is needed, Measures to support the richness of species of arable field plants in organic fields are shown.
   Many organic farmers are aware of correlations between an impoverished landscape and the appearance of pests and diseases and try to enrich the landscape with biotopes, Despite all the benefits of organic farming for nature the danger of separation arises in organic farming too: the separation of the landscape into 5% 'biotopes' where nature is allowed to develop and into 95% 'production area' being used intensively, One step further would be the development from separation to integration of biodiversity into the method of organic fanning as a whole - a way which corresponds with modern aims of the nature conservation movement. The 'integrated table of landscape quality aspects' developed during the work of the concerted action 'The Landscape and Nature Production Capacity of Organic/Sustainable Agriculture' could be useful for the assessment of organic farms under various aspects of biodiversity. It might help to change the farmers' viewpoint and make them assess their particular landscape values and their landscape components with new eyes. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Agricultural researchers recognize the importance of the sustainability of agricultural systems and the need to develop appropriate ways to measure sustainability. The search for agroecosystem performance indicators (APIs) is an urgent task to develop understanding and to facilitate decision-making processes. The paper provides an input/output methodology for a farming system analysis in terms of both energy and monetary values, measurements that are sufficiently homogenizing and comprehensive to document patterns of agroecosystem transfers of bio-physical entities and socio-cultural values. This methodology was applied to two adjacent farms located in Central Italy, which differed in the farming system adopted (mixed fanning and arable farming) and in the level of external input applied. A broad range of APIs (structural and functional, direct and crossed) was developed to analyze both the fundamental energy transfers (and associated allocation of monetary values) between the crucial agroecosystem components and the overall efficiency of the farming system in transforming different external input into output. This analysis shows that energy and monetary values do nor offer a single, coherent account of the functioning of farm systems. The study stresses the need for the development of an environmental accounting method, which integrates ecological and economic aspects, For the present, it is recognized that structural and functional APIs calculated according to energy, rather than monetary, values are more meaningful in both the designing of sustainable fanning systems and in decision-making processes.

DE organic farms; landscape quality; diversity and coherence
ID PERCEPTION
AB Criteria need to be developed to evaluate the cultural environment of European rural landscapes. The goal is to evaluate and encourage the contribution of organic farming to sustainable landscape quality.
   Two sets of criteria were used to evaluate the quality of the cultural environment, non-expert and expert values. The non-expert values consisted of criteria for the appreciation of the present local landscape by users and inhabitants. These criteria were derived from psychological principles (Coeterier, 1996).
   The expert values for landscape assessment were derived from physiognomy, geography and landscape architecture. These criteria require specialized knowledge essential in understanding the cultural history of at least the regional landscape and in landscape planning. The criteria were derived from a reflection of landscape plans at different scale levels (Kuiper, 1998). This reflection resulted in planning objectives based on the following three criteria: diversity; coherence; and continuity.
   Diversity refers to the diversity of landscape components as an expression of the relationships between (and use and abiotic features; coherence refers to coherence among landscape components as an expression of the relationships between sites hydrology, ecology and infrastructure); continuity refers to temporal relationships of land use and spatial arrangement from the past to the future. These three criteria are interrelated and inseparable.
   The need for ecological quality as well as aesthetic quality within the rural landscape is seen as a step forward in cultural development.
   To make EU regulations based on planning objectives seems premature at present. A checklist was established based on the criteria mentioned and was formulated in such a way as to compare an organic farm with a conventional farm in the same landscape unit. The checklist was implemented on organic and adjacent conventional farms in nine regions of Europe. In this article a large farm was considered iir the Dehesa landscape in Andalusia and small farms were considered in the fringe of Lisboa, in the Netherlands and on Crete.
   The two sets of criteria proved able to include all the arguments named during the evaluation of the contribution of organic farms to landscape quality. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB "This landscape is offered to you by the local farmers." In several places throughout the Netherlands and Belgium, billboards with such text can be found along the road. Perhaps the idea to promote farming in this way is new, but, for centuries, farmers, with their techniques and traditions, have strongly influenced the formation and nature of the surrounding landscapes. But what qualities do these landscapes have today?
   The aim of: this study is to assess the (potential) contribution of fanning systems to landscape quality. Eight horticultural farms in the region of West-Friesland (NL) were analysed after an intensive observation study during the four seasons of the year. A theory and a method on landscape quality at regional and farm level were developed. The starting point was that the visual quality of a landscape is determined mainly by four types of landscape coherence: vertical, horizontal, seasonal and historical. There are big differences between the landscape appearances of the eight farms, concerning, firstly, spatial aspects, Like scale, layout and patterns, and, secondly, temporal aspects, like the expression of seasons. As an instrument to assess the quality of farm appearances, reference images were defined. In general, the organic farms had a better landscape quality than the conventional farms.
   These results may offer possibilities to farmers, organisations and policy-makers to improve the qualities of the rural area, for example, by supporting landscape-friendly farming practices:or by local/regional platform discussions. The criteria used can be placed in the cultural realm of the framework created in the Concerted Action on Sustainable Development of Landscapes (see Stobbelaar and Van Mansvelt, 2000).

AB Studies were conducted through a series of experiments for five consecutive wet (July to October) seasons for sustainable and reliable rice yields season after season through effective management of internal resources and nitrogen management by leguminous green manure Sesbania cannabina syn. S. aculeata in the rainfed, lowland, rice-based ecosystem of the coastal region of eastern India, Green manuring with Sesbania aculeata increased rice yield by 7 q/ha. An increase of 3 q/ha was observed in comparison to beushening (Beushening is cross ploughing in standing water under lowland rice ecosystems when rice plants are approximately 45 days old) without fertilizer and green manure treatment - which is the farmers' practice in this coastal region, It is also clear that there is enough scope to replace nitrogen fertilizers totally, a fact that will favour soil health and ecology, eliminate soil pollution and reduce the cost of input and increase the income of the farmer.

AB Traditional approaches to conservation of Garcinia kola and Gnetum africanum were assessed by a survey of 15 villages (three per province) in the humid forest zone of southern Cameroon. Four major land use systems [evergreen forest, degraded forest, bush fallow (10 years and over) and food crop fields] were identified as major niches for the species. The distribution of the plant stands varied from province to province. Gnetum africanum is intensively harvested (up to four times per week throughout the year) and reported to generate substantial income (averaging US$2,630 per household per annum). Indigenous practices used by farmers to protect the species include selective clearing during land preparation for cropping, sustainable bark harvesting of stands in wild population, transplantation of wildings, artificial propagation and recognition of individual property ownership on certain wild stands of G. kola.

ID SYSTEMS; TECHNOLOGY
AB Despite significant progress in promoting the wider use of conservation tillage systems among farmers in Ontario, recent evidence suggests that adoption levels remain low overall, and especially low in those areas where agricultural soils are predominantly clay-based. Given the prominence of cash-crop agriculture in these regions, there is continuing inter-est in understanding the reasons for non-adoption in these areas, and in identifying strategies that would result in greater use of conservation tillage systems. This paper reports on an empirical analysis of conservation tillage adoption among a sample of 50 farmers in Lambton County, Ontario. The purpose of the research was to document and explain variations in the use of conservation tillage, and to assess prospects for increasing the adoption of this technology. A statistical analysis revealed that personal and attitudinal factors were largely unrelated to decisions concerning the use of conservation tillage. instead significant factors related to the scale of the farm operation as reflected in both farm size and sales, and in the nature of the farming system itself Subsequent analysis of farmers' stated motivations and perceived barriers suggests that inertia and uncertainty act as impediments to adoption. The findings point to the need for site-specific and farm system-specific information on the performance of this technology, and to the importance of benefits that are readily observable and communicable within local farming communities.

AB Objectives: To develop and evaluate a new community-based social marketing (CBPM) model. Methods: CBPM is being piloted to prevent the initiation of smoking and alcohol consumption among middle-school students, The project's impact on behavioral outcomes and the community's ability to use CBPM to solve public health problems are being evaluated. Results: Community members have demonstrated an unexpected level of interest in learning CBPM and applying its principles to program planning. Conclusions: Community control of the social marketing process has the potential to enhance program integration into existing community structures, making them more effective and sustainable.

AB The vast forest ecosystems of Russia are very diverse, but poorly managed. Conservation and management of forest animal populations has three main objectives: pest control, preservation of species diversity, and mainentenance of dense game animal populations. Although forest resources should be managed sustainably, the system suffers from lack of coordination between different sectors of administration, low quality of data received from some sources, and poor financial resources.

AB In order to assess the sustainability of mineral supply to fast growing Eucalyptus globulus and Pinus pinaster stands in Galice (NW Spain), we calculated (input-output) nutrient budgets in three small catchments: the Castrove and Jabali catchments with eucalyptus on a base poor granite and the Arcos catchment with pine on granodiorite. In each catchment, the annual drainage output was lower than the rainwater input for Ca, Mg and K. This particularity is attributed to (a) the relative low content of Ca and Mg of the parent material, (b) the very low concentrations of NO3 and SO4 of drainage water in an area with very low level of atmospheric pollution, and (c) to the strong mineral uptake of fast growing stands. The present management of forests leads to negative budgets, both in the eucalyptus and pine catchments. But the traditional management of pine stands including the harvest of needles and branches was much more impoverishing than the present management of eucalyptus stands, where timber is the only harvested product. Various estimates of the weathering rate suggest that this flux is sufficient to compensate for the losses in the catchment on granodiorite but probably insufficient on granite. Since nitrogen deposition is extremely low, and forest fires are quite frequent, the symbiotic fixation of large amounts of nitrogen is needed in order to ensure the sustainability of forest growth.

AB The Framework Convention on Climate Change (FCCC) demands reductions in greenhouse gas emissions by the industrialized countries, while developing countries are still permitted to expand their energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions; To identify, assess and compare options for avoiding and minimizing anthropogenic climate change, the framework of dynamic-game models (the SCX conflict model and the problem-specific TEM model) is applied to analyze the interaction between energy technologies, emission reductions and economic output with regard to energy use and the relationship between conflict and cooperation in climate policy.
   Basic variables are energy production, emissions into the environment, the energy price and the economic output. Major control parameters are the allocation of funding with regard to various energy options and the degree of international cooperation through technology transfer and capital flow. In particular, the impact of cooperation between industrialized and developing countries is evaluated to understand the role of governments in the transition to sustainable market economies.
   Simulations and numerical results are presented which can be used in a constructive way to implement a Joint-implementation Program as an advanced market institution.

AB Linear Programming and Mixed Integer Linear Programs have been used for forest planning since the 60's to support decision making on forest harvesting and management. In particular, during the last two decades of forest management there has been an increased interest in spatial issues. Further, new environmental concerns, such as resource sustainability and wildlife protection, impose that increased attention be paid to activities carried out on the ground. Road building needed for access also requires spatial definiton. As a result, more complex models must be used. We discuss the issues which have led to the combinatorial nature of some main forest management problems and the solution algorithms that have been proposed for these problems, including local search heuristics, random search approaches, strengthening of mixed integer model formulations and Lagrangian relaxation. In this survey, we discuss which of the proposed approaches have been used succesfully, the advantages and shortcomings of each and what are still open research problems.

DE applications; planning; scheduling; search
AB The long-term planning of sustainable forest treatment at the landscape level is an increasingly more complex task. Local treatment schedules, pertaining to homogeneous sub-areas called stands, must be developed over a time horizon of a few centuries. Thousands of local schedules must be coordinated to satisfy hard constraints, and balance soft constraints and optimization criteria. Constraints and objectives are defined in terms of economical, recreational, and environmental effect.
   The aim of the forest treatment schedule is twofold. Over the near time horizon, it must provide clear instructions for forest treatment. In addition, sustainability over the full horizon must be demonstrated. In this context, sustainability means balancing growth and yield in the long term, the preservation of bio-diversity, and catering for human recreational and cultural value. Conventional OR based approaches have failed to give satisfactory results for this type of problem. We describe a method built on explicit constraint descriptions and a memory-based local search procedure for solving rich models of the long-term forest treatment scheduling problem. We also describe a configurable decision support system, called Ecoplan, where the scheduling kernel is based on our method.
   The system relies heavily on close interaction with a stand simulator, which must provide forestry knowledge necessary to guide the scheduling process, including the definition of abstract forest treatment actions. Ecoplan also provides facilities for user interaction in the planning process, functionality for locking specific parts of a plan, and flexibility to alter key factors in the plan such as active constraints and objective criteria. Tn this way, the system supports the definition and exploration of "what-if" scenarios.
   The Ecoplan system has been built on the initiative of the major Norwegian forest owners, addressing a problem area that is becoming increasingly more complex to handle and more critical to society.

AB Violence in schools is a grave issue that is often analyzed in terms of individuals' tendencies toward destructive behavior. While this path of analysis is important, in this article, the author contextualizes violence within a cultural milieu that alienates students from their fundamental yearning for significance. It is argued that violence is a failed epiphany, that is, a heightened moment of awareness emerging out of the everyday flow of experience that seeks to overcome alienation. Violence fails because it cannot create a world of sustainable meaning. The nature of productive epiphanies and the worlds of sustainable meaning that they evoke are discussed in terms of their implication for education and overcoming violence in schools.

AB Recent fieldwork of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, in many parts of the tropics reveals the extent to which they are still undercollected and poorly studied. Recent studies of palms in Madagascar, Cameroon, Lao P.D.R., and Brunei Darussalam have produced many novelties, for example, in Madagascar, 3 new genera and 85 new species. Recent examples from Atlantic coastal Brazil, central Amazonia, and New Guinea are given. Even in apparently well collected areas such as the Ducke Forest Reserve near Manaus, Brazil, and in Brunei where detailed studies of small areas are made, many novelties are found. It is recommended that more such intensive studies of restricted areas are made. The rate of new species that are being described, an average of 2350 over the past nine years, and the rate of additions to Flora Neotropica suggest that the total number of angiosperms is currently being underestimated and that there are in fact between 300,000 and 320,000 species. In order to develop conservation and sustainable use of tropical ecosystems, it is essential that we continue to intensify the rate of collection before it is too late.

AB As we enter the twenty-first century, the terrain on which social policy is made is changing rapidly. This has resulted in anthropologists, in combination with other social scientists, giving serious attention to the impact of this new phase of globalization on changes in social and environmental policies. This review focuses on the ways in which anthropology as a held has contributed, and continues to contribute, to social policy research, practice, and advocacy in the current international context. Given the limited space allotted, we have selected the following six arenas of public policy for analysis and description: (a) links between globalization processes and policy on the national and local levels; (b) social welfare policy, including employment and family welfare survival strategies; (c) the impact of structural adjustment and economic restructuring on migration and labor force incorporation; (d) policies in the north and south related to global agriculture, social inequality, and the manipulations of some multinational corporations; (c) policies affecting sustainable agriculture; and (f) the role of anthropologists in examining the impact of political and economic hegemony on the environment.

AB A young man adrift, I was rescued by Paul Gast, a college classmate, and sent off to Columbia's Lament Geological Observatory as a summer intern. As it turns out, I am still there. During this 47-year sojourn, I have been a participant in the enormous expansion of the field of isotope geochemistry. I experienced the golden age when so many plums awaited picking that we, the pioneers, gorged ourselves with exciting discovery. Being at what is now called Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory put me at the center of many of the developments that changed forever the Earth Sciences. It also made me part of the great challenge associated with the drive to replace the exploitative mode that characterized the Industrial Revolution with what is often referred to as the sustainable mode. In the following pages I recount my path from confused youth to the globe-encircling oceanic "conveyor belt.".

AB Estuarine sediment from Charleston Harbor, South Carolina, was used as inoculum for the development of an anaerobic enrichment culture that specifically dechlorinates doubly flanked chlorines (i.e., chlorines bound to carbon that are flanked on both sides by other chlorine-carbon bonds) of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Dechlorination was restricted to the para chlorine in cultures enriched with 10 mM fumarate, 50 ppm (173 mu M) 2,3, 4,5-tetrachlorobiphenyl, and no sediment. Initially the rate of dechlorination decreased upon the removal of sediment from the medium. However, the dechlorinating activity was sustainable, and following sequential transfer in a defined, sediment-free estuarine medium, the activity increased to levels near that observed with sediment. The culture was nonmethanogenic, and molybdate, ampicillin. chloramphenicol, neomycin, and streptomycin inhibited dechlorination activity; bromoethanesulfonate and vancomycin did not. Addition of 17 PCB congeners indicated that the culture specifically removes double flanked chlorines, preferably in the para position, and does not attack ortho chlorines. This is the first microbial consortium shown to para or meta dechlorinate a PCB congener in a defined sediment-free medium. It is the second PCB-dechlorinating enrichment culture to be sustained in the absence of sediment, but its dechlorinating capabilities are entirely different from those of the other sediment-free PCB-dechlorinating culture, an ortho-dechlorinating consortium, and do not match any previously published Aroclor-dechlorinating patterns.

AB This paper deals with the question: do some food systems engender a more positive social environment than others, and does this matter? The pressure to generate financial capital from food production is enormous, especially for a country like Australia, and financial imperatives clearly drive choice of food production methods. Many have argued that environmental costs of food production are hardly ever factored into the profitability equation and the notion of sustainable development represents a position where consideration is given to environmental concerns while at the same time maximizing economic returns. While the importance of choice of food system in order to benefit the natural environment has been argued for, another environment - that of the social environment - remains relatively underexplored.

   SUPPLEMENTATION
AB Three nutrients, iron, zinc and pro-vitamin A, are widely deficient in humans, especially among low socioeconomic groups in developing countries, but they remain significant concerns in industrialized countries as well. Cereals provide the majority of the intake of these nutrients in low-income families. Moreover, these three nutrients may interact synergistically in absorption and function to such an extent that there are potentially huge advantages in providing all three together in the one staple food. Because of this, they may be more bioavailable to deficient individuals than current thinking allows. To do so would provide a sound basis on which to build a better balanced diet for nutritionally compromised individuals. Genetic variation in nutrient composition exists in cereals and can be exploited in conventional breeding programmes and through gene technology. Cultural techniques, including fertiliser technology and organic farming, have also impacted upon the nutrient composition of cereals. Human iron and zinc intake can be doubled at least, and essential carotenoid intakes can be increased dramatically. Preliminary feeding trials with nutrient-dense grains have been encouraging. Moreover, nutrient-dense seeds also produce more vigorous seedlings and higher grain yield in soils where these nutrients are poorly available, so that to a significant extent agronomic and health objectives coincide. New varieties are rapidly adopted, especially where there are yield advantages, ensuring maximum impact without new inputs. This approach is potentially more sustainable than fortification and supplementation programmes because intake is continuous, which is especially important for zinc because it is needed almost daily.

TI Learning from nature, technologies and economics; COGEMA's strategic
   approach of the nuclear fuel cycle front-end
SO ATW-INTERNATIONALE ZEITSCHRIFT FUR KERNENERGIE
LA English
DT Article
AB Early next century the COGEMA Group will approach the twenty-fifth anniversary of its foundation. COGEMA was established in 1976 to supply the French park of nuclear power plants. In the meantime, the company has expanded its activities so as to include products and services supporting customers in running nuclear power plants.
   As the company's activities about the back end of the nuclear fuel cycle are probably better known than its capabilities and products associated with the front end of that cycle, it may be in order to consider that COGEMA and its subsidiaries are among the marker leaders in the fields of uranium mining, uranium conversion, and uranium enrichment.
   Contrary to predictions in the seventies, on which they had been based, uranium supply and nuclear fuel cycle services had to be adapted to a reduced requirement and to advanced technologies. In an environment like this, competitiveness is not only a precondition for survival in the market, but also helps utilities, in more and more deregulated markets, to support electricity generation in nuclear power plants in a fierce competition with other energy sources. Being a supplier, COGEMA feels obliged to pursue the sustainable generation of electricity in nuclear power plants, and seeks to maintain its competitiveness in the field also by paying attention to economic and technical risks associated with the supply of nuclear fuels in the long run.
   In uranium mining, COGEMA mainly tried to adapt production and the portfolio of resources to the changed realities of the market, moving towards low-cost operations. Decisions in this field typically must be taken fifteen or twenty years prior to an anticipated commissioning date. COGEMA's move to integrate into the market natural uruanium from Russian weapon programs expands its supply base and helps to remove long-term uncertainties of the natural uranium market.
   In the field of uranium conversion, COMURHEX holds a trump card in this currently rather narrow market segment thanks to its geographic and structural proximity to the mining and enrichment activities of COGEMA.
   Uranium enrichment is influenced a great deal by technical boundary conditions. COGEMA has secured a unique position, on the one hand, by running a gaseous diffusion plant in France and, at the same rime, by developing the centrifuge and laser technologies for potential further use.
   This strategy will not come as a surprise, given that a company characterized largely by its long-term worldwide commitment to uranium mining has learned to reconcile economic requirements with the peculiarities and whims of nature.

AB This article discusses initial experiences with a new assurance service: the verification of sustainability reports providing assertions regarding financial, environmental, and social issues. For illustration purposes, references to the verification of The Shell Report 2000 are made. Because of the new content and format of sustainability reports, established standards for reporting and verification are not yet available. Therefore, applying specifically developed criteria is inevitable.
   In this article, examples and characteristics of criteria that are needed to evaluate management assertions regarding sustainability are described. Furthermore, verification procedures that can be used and the content and design of a conclusion on a sustainabilty audit are described. It can be concluded that the verification of sustainability reports is a very challenging assurance service for financial auditors. Academics should be challenged as well, because of the need for further research in this area.

AB The vulnerability of horticultural industries in Australia to the Queensland fruit fly Bactrocera (Dacus) tryoni under climate change is examined. Vulnerability is defined in terms of sensitivity and adaptation options. Regional estimates of fruit fly density are fed into an economic model that takes account of costs of damage, management, regulation and research. Sensitivity analyses are used to estimate potential future costs under climate change by recalculating costs with increases in temperature of 0.5 degrees C, 1.0 degrees C and 2 degrees C. It is assumed that irrigation will automatically compensate for any changes in rainfall.
   The current national, annual cost of Queensland fruit fly is estimated to be $AU28.5 million/year ($25.7-49.9 million), with 60% of the cost borne by commercial growers. Climatic warming threatens the sustainability of area freedom in the Fruit Fly Exclusion Zone (FFEZ) and is likely to increase damage and control costs to commercial growers in endemic areas, except in northern Australia. Costs to mainland apple, orange, and pear growers are estimated to increase by $3.1, $4.7, and $12.0 million with increases of 0.5 degrees C, 1.0 degrees C, and 2 degrees C, respectively. These represent increases of 25%, 38%, and 95%, respectively, but do not reflect the greatly increased risks of failure to maintain area freedom in the FFEZ. Growers in endemic Queensland fruit fly areas can expect their costs to increase 42-82%, compared with 24-83% in the FFEZ. Increased damage to backyard growers is likely, especially in South Australia and Victoria. Thus the fly poses a real threat to southern States under modest projected increases in temperatures. The extent of the likely cost increases raises questions about the industries' ability to pay and remain competitive.
   The current analysis illustrates the potential benefits of taking a national and strategic approach to the management of insect pests in Australia. A combination of CLIMEX modelling, sensitivity analysis and mapping provided valuable insights into both industry and regional vulnerabilities. Adaptation options require further quantification, but that awaits a credible population model of Queensland fruit fly. Costs need to be discounted, depending on the expected timing of the temperature increases.

AB Naturalised pastures across the higher rainfall (>600 mm) perennial pasture zone of southeastern Australia are less productive than they were, while sown pastures fail to maintain their initial levels of production. Several factors have contributed to this, including lack of knowledge of suitable grazing practices, weed invasion, increasing acid soils, rising water tables and poor management practices during droughts. A key issue in each case is the decline in perennial grass species which is both a cause and effect of the decline in productivity and sustainability of these ecosystems. This paper introduces a volume devoted to the largest collaborative study done to evaluate tactics for better grazing management and to improve the sustainability of perennial pasture ecosystems. Grazing practices to manage the composition of pastures have been largely neglected in pasture research, but are an important first step in improving pasture sustainability. This paper also outlines a new, open communal grazing experimental design which was developed and used across 24 sites on farms in New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania and South Australia, to evaluate tactics for grazing management. The general aim across these experiments was to maintain (if adequate) or enhance (if degraded), the proportion of desirable perennial grasses in the sward to achieve more sustainable pastures. The results will provide the basis for building more sustainable grazing systems.

CT Workshop on Temperater Pasture Sustainability Key Program (TPSKP)
CY NOV, 1997
CL SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA
AB Long-term agricultural experiments such as the Temperate Pastures Sustainability Key Program (TPSKP) present significant challenges in the areas of planning and design, conduct, analysis and reporting. This paper concentrates on 2 aspects, namely, the experimental design and the statistical analysis.
   For long-term agricultural experiments which examine the effects of management strategies over time, an enumeration of the initial biodiversity is essential and permits the allocation of treatments to plots in such a way that potential bias in the estimation of treatment effects due to lack of uniformity in experimental units (plots) is reduced in the covariate analysis. Spatial replication is considered essential and the design should include at least 2 starting dates for management strategies so that the possible interaction between the year of start and the management strategy can be described.
   The data resulting from repeated measurement of herbage mass of major individual species or species groups represent a longitudinal data set with complexity due to the staggered commencement of treatments and also in part due to the nature of some of the strategies (closure and cuts). The analysis presented is the cubic smoothing spline approach of Verbyla et al. (1999) which integrates cubic splines, random coefficients, covariance modelling and estimation of systematic deviation. This approach, based on linear mixed models and using residual maximum likelihood (REML) has the flexibility to cope with the staggered imposition of management strategies and permits the partitioning of trends into smooth and non-smooth components, thereby quantifying species persistence and seasonal influence under each management strategy.

ID PASTURES
AB The effect of various grazing management treatments on newly sown and degraded perennial ryegrass pastures was studied at 6 different locations in the temperate high rainfall zone of southern Australia, as part of the Temperate Pasture Sustainability Key Program. The sites were located at Hamilton (2 sites, 1 grazed by cattle, 1 grazed by sheep) and Cavendish, western Victoria, Victor Harbor (Delamere), South Australia, and Ross and Parattah in Tasmania. Grazing management treatments significantly influenced the ryegrass mass and persistence of the pasture, but effects were not always consistent across sites. Autumn closure increased the perennial ryegrass content at Cavendish and Ross, as did the winter and summer closures at Ross. Spring closure increased the perennial ryegrass content at Hamilton, Cavendish and Ross, but decreased it at Parattah, as did the summer closures at Parattah and Delamere. Fodder conservation decreased the ryegrass only at Parattah. At the Hamilton sheep site, and at Ross, mob stocking increased the ryegrass content, as did increased superphosphate treatments at Hamilton. Rotational grazing at Cavendish and Delamere increased the ryegrass content, as did the late spring or a late summer closure with a short autumn deferment at Cavendish and Ross, but both these treatments decreased ryegrass at Parattah. The treatments that had a negative effect at Parattah may have had a positive effect on cocksfoot at that site, creating competition for, and decreasing the ryegrass content. At most sites, treatments that included some spelling during spring to foster seed shedding, and spelling again in the following autumn to encourage germination seem to have been of benefit to the perennial ryegrass.

CY NOV, 1997

AB Grazing management strategies to alter botanical composition of native pastures were investigated at 4 locations in the high rainfall zone of south-east Australia, including Tasmania. These studies were conducted as part of the Temperate Pasture Sustainability Key Program, which evaluated the effects of grazing management on a wide range of pasture types between 1993 and 1996. Pastures in this study were based on Aristida ramosalBothriochloa macra, Microlaena stipoides-Austrodanthonia spp. or Themeda triandra-Austrodanthonia spp. Seasonal rests, increased grazing pressure in spring, mob stocking and cutting for hay were compared to continuous grazing at all sites. In addition, specific local treatments were tested at individual sites. Changes in composition resulting from the treatments were minimal at most sites. This may have been due to a combination of the inherent stability of the pastures, the relatively short duration of the experiments, and the drought conditions experienced, which minimised differences between treatments. Some strategies to alter composition of natural pastures are suggested. In the Aristida-Bothriochloa pasture there was a general decrease in Aristida and an increase in Bothriochloa, which was largely unaffected by the type of grazing management applied. The combination of drought conditions and increasing grazing pressure was sufficient to alter composition without specific management strategies being necessary. In the Themeda-Austrodanthonia pasture, resting in spring, 12-month rests or cutting for hay (which involved a spring rest) allowed Themeda to increase in the pasture. The Microlaena-Austrodanthonia pastures were very stable, especially where annual grass content was low. However, certain treatments allowed Microlaena to increase, a result which is regarded as being favourable. The major effects in these latter pastures were on undesirable species. Vulpia spp. were reduced by resting in autumn and increased spring grazing pressure, while Holcus lanatus was increased dramatically by resting in spring and was also increased by resting in autumn or winter, but only when conditions were suitable for growth of this species. In many cases, treatment differences were only expressed following recovery from drought, showing that timing of grazing management to achieve change is critical.

AB The GrassGro decision support tool combines animal intake and nutrition models, soil moisture and pasture growth models with management rules. GrassGro simulates pasture and animal production using a wide range of pasture species and sheep and cattle enterprises. Data from the Temperate Pasture Sustainability Key Program grazing management sites were used to validate the predictions of GrassGro.
   The pasture and animal production from a diverse range of sites were successfully simulated. Limitations of GrassGro were identified (parameter sets not available for some pasture species, inability to simulate clumpy swards, rudimentary interspecies competition model) and some improvements were made to its performance (improved species parameter sets and improved modeling of rooting depth). Recommendations are made on priority areas of research to improve GrassGro and on improvements in methodology which could be adopted by future programs like Temperate Pasture Sustainability Key Program.

AB An experiment was conducted to examine the effect of deep-rooted perennial grasses on the water and nitrogen economy of 3 mature pasture communities with different botanical compositions but the same fertiliser history. One pasture was dominated by volunteer naturalised pasture grasses (Eleusine tristachya and Danthonia spp.) (termed 'degraded'), another was phalaris (Phalaris aquatica) dominant (phalaris), and a third was dominated by phalaris into which white clover (Trifolium repens) had been recently sown (phalaris-white clover).
   Two replicates of each pasture type were grazed continuously over 4 years with young weaner sheep changed each year. Measurements of hydrology, nutrient cycling, botanical composition and animal production were made in order to quantify the sustainability characteristics of each of the pasture types.
   Data are summarised as absolute measures at various points in time and also as trends over time. The ranking of standardised treatment measures was then summed to provide an index of sustainability with or without a weighting assumed to be representative of the relative importance of various layers of sustainability viewed from the perspective of a hypothetical 'typical' grazier. The results show that the phalaris-white clover treatment was substantially more sustainable, in both ecological and economic terms, than either of the other treatments. The unweighted index for the phalaris-white clover pasture was 3.61 compared to 2.08 and 1.98 for the phalaris and 'degraded' pastures, respectively.

AB A field study was carried out in the high rainfall zone (HRZ, >600 mm p.a.) of southern Australia from March 1994 to August 1997 to test the hypothesis that sown perennial grasses and liming could make the existing pastures more sustainable through better use of water and nitrogen. The site, on an acid duplex soil at Book Book near Wagga Wagga in southern New South Wales, was typical of much of the HRZ grazing country in southern New South Wales and north-east Victoria. The experiment consisted of 4 replicate paddocks (each 0.135 ha) of 4 treatments: annual pasture (mainly ryegrass Lolium rigidum, silver grass Vulpia spp., subterranean clover Trifolium subterraneum and broadleaf weeds) without lime, annual pasture with lime, perennial pasture (phalaris Phalaris aquatica, cocksfoot Dactylis glomerata and subterranean clover T. subterraneum) without lime, and perennial pasture with lime. Soil pH (0-10 cm) in the limed treatments was maintained at 5.5 (0.01 mol/L CaCl2), compared to 4.1 in the unlimed treatments. The pastures were rotationally grazed with Merino ewe or wether hoggets at a stocking rate which varied with the season, but was 10-25% higher on the limed pastures [14.8-17.3 dry sheep equivalent (dse)/ha] than the unlimed pastures. One replicate set of pasture treatments was intensively monitored for surface runoff, subsurface flow (at the top of the B horizon), water potential gradients and ammonium volatilisation. Other measurements of nitrogen inputs, transformations and losses were made on all paddocks.
   In a normal to wet year, surface runoff, subsurface flow and deep drainage (>180 cm depth) were about 40 mm less from the perennial than the annual pastures. The reduction in deep drainage under the perennials was about one-third to one-half (20-29 mm/year). The smaller loss of solution NO3- from the perennial pastures (up to 12 kg N/ha.year) suggested soil acidification under perennials was reduced by about 1 kmol H+/ha.year. Denitrification and volatilisation losses of N were small (1-12 kg N/ha.year). Nitrogen fixed by subterranean clover (above ground parts) ranged from 2-8 kg N/ha in the drought of 1994-95 to 128 kg N/ha in a normal year (1996). The soil-pasture nitrogen balance was positive for all treatments and averaged 76 kg N/ha.year over 2 years.
   The abundance of introduced and native earthworms increased from 85 to 250/m(2) in the limed pastures between 1994 and 1997. Introduced species, such as Aporrectodea trapezoides, were especially responsive to lime. Animal production per hectare was 10-25% higher on pastures with lime. Critical gross margins per dse were lowest ($16/ha) for a long-lived perennial pasture (>15 years), and highest ($20/ha) for a short-lived perennial (5 years). Overall, there were substantial benefits in animal production, improved soil quality and water use from establishing perennial grass pastures with lime on these strongly acid soils.

CY NOV, 1997

AB Poor persistence of sown pastures, trends of low pasture resowing rates and a substantial decline in carrying capacity of non-crop areas bring into question the basis of the philosophy of pasture improvement by sowing pasture species. If graziers are to adopt grazing strategies or stocking rates that are more ecologically sustainable, then clearly they must also be cost-effective in either increasing income or reducing costs so that they are economically sustainable. This paper describes the use of an interactive spreadsheet model developed to assist graziers and their advisers with assessing the long-term profitability of pasture management and/or improvement (and therefore pasture persistence). The model provides a comparative cash flow for different levels of inputs (fertiliser, herbicides and feed supplements) over a 15-year period. Results clearly show that at the same stocking rate, different animal enterprises have markedly different profitabilities over a 15-year period. Further, for native, improved and sown pastures, the most profitable pastures are those that can sustain increased stocking rates for long periods of time, without the need for resowing.

CL SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA
AB Grazing management decisions by beef cattle and sheep producers in south-eastern Australia have tended to be influenced more by the needs of livestock, often with little consideration given to the possible short- or long-term production impacts that the duration or intensity of grazing may have on pastures. This is partially due to inadequate knowledge of these impacts on some pasture types. Grazing decisions relating principally to livestock tend to be based on a subjective appraisal of liveweight change and pasture assessments often with inadequate understanding of critical pasture characteristics influencing livestock production or the ability to assess these characteristics.
   PROGRAZE is an extension package developed to assist beef cattle and sheep producers improve the quality of grazing management decision making so they more efficiently and effectively achieve their production and market targets for livestock and livestock products while maintaining or improving the productivity and sustainability of their pastures.
   To measure knowledge change, PROGRAZE participants were surveyed before they commenced the course and again at its conclusion. To measure on-farm adoption of the skills and knowledge contained within PROGRAZE, participants were again surveyed about 12 months after completing the course. Five focus groups were conducted as a means of obtaining direct feedback from a range of participants on issues not adequately addressed through the surveys.
   The surveys showed the most significant area in knowledge change by participants was associated with pasture quality and the influence of pasture characteristics on pasture intake and livestock prodution. There was strong evidence of practice change by participants particularly, grazing decisions associated with pasture management. When asked whether participation in PROGRAZE had resulted in increased financial returns from their grazing enterprise, 89% replied it had and 91% indicated participation would lead to more sustainable pastures. The overall response to PROGRAZE was positive with 59% of those producers who replied to the survey indicating it exceeded or completely met their expectations and another 36% stating that it had mostly met expectations. Ninety-nine percent of respondents indicated that they would recommend PROGRAZE to fellow producers.

DE pasture decline; grazing management; farmer attitudes; sustainability
AB The improvement of the sustainability of meat and wool production in the high rainfall temperate zone of Australia depends, in part, on the extension of grazing management approaches to maintain a desirable species composition. A survey of producers in this zone was undertaken to describe some of the factors relevant to the adoption of grazing management practices. It was found that there is widespread concern among producers about pasture decline. Weeds and weed control appear to play an important role in producers' perceptions of the problem and appropriate remedial action. Producers do not seem to doubt that grazing management might be used to maintain a desirable species composition, but substantial numbers believe that other influences, such as drought, may over-ride the capacity of grazing management to maintain a desirable species composition. The implications of these findings for the extension of grazing management practices to producers, are discussed.

ID ACIDIFICATION
AB The Temperate Pasture Sustainability Key Program (TPSKP) was established across southeastern Australia to test the hypotheses that an improved perennial grass content in pastures would result in fewer weeds, better water use (and hence lesser impacts on soil salinity), and lower soil acidification rates. Grazing tactics were seen as a means to enhance or maintain the perennial grass content. Soil and water sustainability experiments in summer and winter dominant rainfall environments showed fewer weeds, improvements in water use and less acidity under perennial versus annual grass pastures. Further work is needed to determine if these gains are sufficient to make perennial grass pastures sustainable in the long-term as some nitrate leakage still occurred at the winter rainfall site. Indicators were developed to rate the sustainability of treatments within experiments. A subset of these indicators was common across experiments and could readily be used by farmers to provide an initial assessment of the soil and water sustainability of their pasture systems. These are: the mineral nitrogen at the bottom of the root zone (40-60 cm); soil pH at the surface and bottom of the root zone and perennial grass content by species. Managing pastures through droughts is a critical aspect of grazing management in Australia. Experiments within the TPSKP demonstrated that perennial grasses survived during drought when maintained above critical lower biomass values. These values ranged from 0.5 to 1.5 t DM/ha depending upon species. Over all experiments, there was general support for the view that maintaining a higher level of biomass in pastures resulted in more sustainable systems.
   Twenty-three grazing experiments using an open communal grazing design showed that most perennial grasses were sensitive to grazing at some stage in their seasonal growth cycles. The exceptions were inconclusive for several reasons e.g. the grazing pressure may not have been high enough at those sites to elucidate any effects; they occurred where the perennial grass content was less than 10% or exceeded 70%, of the sward; or were confounded by interactions between species where the species under study was not dominant. After taking these exceptions into account, it was then possible to determine where grazing tactics could be expected to work. Species differed in their response to grazing. Some perennial grasses were more sensitive to grazing during periods of stress (e.g. dry summers) than when actively growing (e.g. cocksfoot), while the reverse applied with others (e.g. phalaris). Of the grasses sensitive to grazing when actively growing, sensitivity of some was largely confined to the reproductive period (e.g. perennial ryegrass). Across most experiments, continuous grazing resulted in either a decline in or no net benefit to, the perennial grass content. Microlaena stipoides was the only species to respond to increased grazing pressure - this only applied in spring. The experiments clearly showed that tactical rests were an important tool for grassland management. The effects recorded were predominantly expressed through impacts on vegetative growth and survival of existing plants. Short-term experiments and dry seasons did not enable recruitment processes to be studied. Within pastures, grazing tactics can influence many species. The challenge is to use the TPSKP outcomes to develop strategies that optimise the composition of these swards. Due to the short-term nature of these experiments the results were evaluated within a conservative framework and often simply on the absolute level of parameters. Techniques need to be developed to more effectively monitor the process (i.e. rates of change), rather than the consequences (i.e. ends).
   The information gained in this program needs to be incorporated into practical strategies for better management of pastures and tested at a commercial scale. The TPSKP was one of the largest, coordinated pasture programs ever attempted. Some major outcomes were the experience gained by a large number of grassland scientists in running such programs, the development and acceptance of standardised measurement protocols and a much stronger network among grazing systems scientists committed to achieving improved management systems.

DT Article
DE grazing plan; pasture and livestock management; PROGRAZE
AB This paper describes PRO Plus, a whole-farm fodder budgeting decision support system for beef, sheep meat and wool producers. The program predicts the pasture mass available at the end of each month for individual paddocks based on pasture growth rates, number of stock, intake and the grazing plan where producers allocate mobs weekly to paddocks. Two case studies are presented that identify how the program can be used individually or in conjunction with other programs to make management decisions. PRO Plus is an integral component of the PROGRAZE Plus course and assists producers to improve the financial viability and sustainability of their farms through better pasture and grazing management.

   study to explore the potential of farmer participation in the
   development of indicators
SO AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
DE sustainability; farming systems; farmer perceptions; indicators; focus
   groups; resource management
AB In Australia, the work being carried out on sustainability indicators has become an industry on its own. This paper firstly provides an introduction that reviews the literature on indicator development and use, particularly in relation to agricultural production systems. A number of reasons for the limited use of indicators by farmers are mentioned. Secondly, a focus group study involving farmers from two dryland cropping areas in Queensland to investigate sustainability indicators and sustainable farming systems is presented. The indicators the participants identified during focus groups included indicators that reflect (i) farming system components, (ii) the management of these components, (iii) the management of all components and their interrelationships at the systems level, and (iv) the external factors that influence and interact with this systems level. Focus group analysis also showed that the participants perceived sustainability as an on-going process and a sustainable farming system as dynamic and emergent in nature. The implications of these findings are discussed. Three key issues were raised (i) the value of farmer knowledge with respect to the development of indicators has often been ignored; (ii) there are links between indicators developed through traditional science and those being used by farmers; and (iii) off-farm indicators used by farmers may be very useful in policy development at a variety of levels (e.g. catchment, regional, national, global). The focus group method involving farmers provided a useful way to gain insights about farmer perceptions and for farmers to learn from each other during the research process.

   TIME
AB Sustainable fertiliser management involves maximising production, preventing on-site soil degradation and minimising off-site movement of nutrients. In the past, fertiliser management has been driven by the need to maximise production.
   Fertiliser costs are generally less than 10% of the variable production costs in horticultural enterprises and this has often led to excessive application of nutrients. Fertiliser experiments have not generally provided calibrated soil or leaf test data because of their shortterm nature, the biennial or variable production of many tree crops, their narrow focus and the difficulty in demonstrating yield responses because tree crops have relatively low rates of nutrient removal over long periods of time. Nutrient balance is a basically sound approach to developing fertiliser recommendations and can be easily estimated from crop nutrient removal data. This approach has been used successfully for crops such as low-chill stonefruit (Huett and Stewart 1999) and a simplified approach is presented for passionfruit, mango and avocado based on nutrient uptake by well-managed, mature, productive orchards.
   Macronutrient removal by a 20 t/ha passionfruit crop was (kg/ha) 55 nitrogen (N), 78 potassium (K), 6 phosphorus (P), 6 sulfur (S), 5 calcium (Ca) and 4 magnesium (Mg). For a 10 t/ha mango crop it was (kg/ha) 11 N, 15 K, 2 P, 1 S, 2 Ca and 2 Mg. For a 10 t/ha avocado crop it was (kg/ha) 41 N, 61 K, 8 P, 4 S, 7 Ca and 8 Mg. Passionfruit, in contrast to tree crops, is generally a 3-year crop and nutrient uptake by developing leaf, vines and roots will inflate nutrient uptake by a factor of 2-3. Nutrient losses due to leaching, runoff and fixation will further inflate fertiliser requirements. However, the inclusion of these additional factors still means that nutrient application rates will be substantially less than current fertiliser recommendations.

AB The effect of using different crop rotations, including legumes and fallows, on soil structural stability, unsaturated hydraulic conductivity, and the concentration of different carbon fractions was examined in a long-term rotation trial established in 1966 on a Black Earth (Pellic Vertisol) and a Red Clay (Chromic Vertisol) soil. There was a large decrease in the concentration of soil carbon fractions following cropping and cultivation on both soils. The inclusion of some legume rotation crops resulted in an increase in labile carbon concentrations compared with continuous wheat or a long fallow treatment. Aggregate stability to wetting under both immersion and tension wetting was reduced as a result of cropping and cultivation for both soil types. However, there was an improvement in aggregate stability with immersion wetting, on the Red Clay soil, for the lucerne (Medicago sativa), clover (Trifolium subterraneum), and continuous wheat (Triticum aestivium) treatments compared with the long fallow. Similar results were found for the Black Earth soil; however, on this soil the medic (Medicago scutella) rotation also showed an improvement in soil structure. On the Red Clay soil there was a decrease in hydraulic conductivity (K) with cropping, at all tensions measured. K for the Black Earth soil was higher at 30 and 40 mm tension on the cropped soil than on the uncropped reference soil, but at 10 mm tension the reference soil had a higher K value than all rotations except the lucerne. There was a significant correlation between labile carbon and all determinations of aggregate stability for the Red Clay soil. Farmers should be encouraged to eliminate long fallowing and to adopt no-till techniques combined with the return of residues from either the primary crop or rotation crops which have a slower breakdown rate, as this management is likely to have a better potential for increasing soil carbon content and improving soil structure. The investigation of ways to better increase the quantity and quality of soil organic matter and hence soil chemical and physical fertility is necessary if long-term sustainable agriculture is to be possible.

AB Changes in soil properties in response to cropping pressure were measured in 2 mineralogically contrasting New Zealand topsoils. Waiareka clay (Vertic Haplustoll) with >65% smectite clay was compared with Wakanui silt loam (Aquic Haplustept), which contains about 20% mixed or illite clays. Soil properties (0-10 cm) were assessed by changes in organic carbon (C) and nitrogen (N), pH, cation exchange capacity, Olsen P, microbial C, soil respiration, microbial functional evenness, mineralisable N, bulk density, unsaturated hydraulic conductivity, readily available and total available water, macro porosity and total porosity, particle density, and particle size distribution. Additional samples of the Waiareka clay soil were taken at 10-20 cm depth. Cropping pressure was estimated using a scale based on the number of years in crop v. those in pasture.
   The organic and biological status of the Waiareka pasture soil (0-10 cm) was greater than that of the Wakanui pasture, with contents of 5.1% organic C, 0.43% total N, 1429 microbial C (mu g/cm(3)), and 123 mineralisable N (mu g/cm(3)), compared with values of 4.0%, 0.31%, 795 mu g/cm(3), and 89 mu g/cm(3), respectively. Total and macroporosity, and total and readily available water, were also greater on the Waiareka pasture soil compared with the Wakanui pasture soil. Under cropping pressure, the Waiareka soil had marked declines in organic matter C and N, microbial C and soil respiration, microbial functional evenness, macroporosity, and available water. In contrast, the Wakanui silt loam showed little response to cropping pressure; mineralisable N declined slightly and particle density increased under cropping.
   We concluded that the initial properties of a soil were not good predictors of subsequent resistance to cropping pressure; and that soils with initially high status have the potential for proportionally greater decline.

AB The rates at which nutrients are released to, and removed from, the mineral nutrient pool are important in regulating the nutrient supply to plants. These nutrient transformation rates need to be taken into account when developing nutrient management strategies for economical and sustainable production. A method that is gaining popularity for determining the gross transformation rates of nutrients in the soil is the isotopic dilution technique. The technique involves labelling a soil mineral nutrient pool, e.g. NH4+, NO3-, PO43-, or SO42-, and monitoring the changes with time of the size of the labelled nutrient pool and the excess tracer abundance (atom%, if stable isotope tracer is used) or specific activity (if radioisotope is used) in the nutrient pool. Because of the complexity of the concepts and procedures involved, the method has sometimes been used incorrectly, and results misinterpreted. This paper discusses the isotopic dilution technique, including the theoretical background, the methodologies to determine the gross flux rates of nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur, and the limitations of the technique. The assumptions, conceptual models, experimental procedures, and compounding factors are discussed. Possible effects on the results by factors such as the uniformity of tracer distribution in the soil, changes in soil moisture content, substrate concentration, and aeration status, and duration of the experiment are also discussed. The influx and out-flux transformation rates derived from this technique are often contributed by several processes simultaneously, and thus cannot always be attributed to a particular nutrient transformation process. Despite the various constraints or possible compounding factors, the technique is a valuable tool that can provide important quantitative information on nutrient dynamics in the soil-plant system.

AB Concern over the long-term sustainability of post-mining ecosystems at Weipa (North Queensland, Australia) led to investigations of soil organic matter dynamics, a key process linking soil and vegetation development in maintenance-free systems. Paper I of this series examined the short-term effects of rehabilitation operations on soil organic matter. Here, we assess the medium-term development of post-rehabilitation soil organic matter quantity and quality using mine soil chronosequences of up to 22 years post-rehabilitation at Weipa. Soils had been respread either immediately after stripping or after stripped soil had been stockpiled for several years. Sites surveyed were revegetated with native tree and shrub species, forestry (Khaya senegalensis), or pasture (Brachiaria decumbens/Stylosanthes spp.). Three areas of undisturbed native forest were included for comparison.
   Compared with the undisturbed forest, rehabilitated soils were shallower and more compacted, contained more gravel, and, as a result of topsoil-subsoil mixing, stored less organic matter in the surface soil. Rehabilitated sites respread with stockpiled soil were more compacted and lower in all quantitative and qualitative measures of organic matter than freshly replaced soils. With time, organic matter accumulated in the surface soil under all vegetation types at rates of up to 1.25 t C/ha. year, but new equilibrium levels were yet to be reached. Accumulated organic matter was mostly associated with clay and silt-sized particles, indicating effective cycling of litter to humus. Nitrogen mineralisation capacity increased with time under all vegetation types. The incidence of fire led to increased total and light-fraction organic C, but this was probably as charcoal C. Sites where volunteer grass biomass was reduced pre-planting by late-season stripping or disc-ploughing accumulated less organic C.
   To optimise post-mining soil organic matter development, we recommend that soil stockpiling be avoided, that more volunteer grasses be retained to ensure continuity of organic inputs, and that attention be focussed on minimising soil compaction and gravel incorporation-both permanent limitations to plant growth.

AB Mine site rehabilitation should aim to establish quickly and maintain the processes of nutrient cycling at rates comparable with, or approaching, those of native forests. Current management strategies for rehabilitating bauxite mines and other mine sites in Australia usually include planting fast-growing understorey species at high densities and applying fertiliser. We provide the first detailed study of nitrogen (N) availability and N transformations (mineralisation/immobilisation) in such rehabilitated mine sites. Mean concentrations of NO3- (0-5 cm) in a chronosequence (7, 13, 22, and 27 years old) of rehabilitated mine sites ranged from 0.5 to 1.3 kg/ha, and NH4+ from 4.0 to 9.5 kg/ha. In burnt and unburnt native jarrah (E. marginata Donn ex. Smith) forests adjacent to the mine site, mean NO3- concentrations in surface soil (0-5 cm) were 0.8 kg/ha (burnt) and 1.1 kg/ha (unburnt), and mean NH4+ concentrations were 6.8 kg/ha (burnt) and 7.8 kg/ha (unburnt). Concentration of NH4+ at 0-5 cm was strongly related to soil water content (R-2 = 0.69, P < 0.05) in rehabilitation sites, but not at 5-10 cm depth. Rates of N mineralisation (0-5 cm) in rehabilitation sites ranged from 34 to 52 kg/ha. year, of the same order as rates in native forest soil. In all rehabilitation and native forest sites, rates of N mineralisation were significantly related to rates of N-uptake at both 0-5 and 5-10 cm depth (R-2 > 0.63, P < 0.05). Soil C/N ratios (0-5 cm) in rehabilitation sites ranged from 22.4 to 38.8, and in native forests from 35.6 (burnt) to 40.3 (unburnt). Soil C/N ratios increased with depth in both rehabilitation and native forest sites (ranged from 31.2 to 51.6). Availability of water was the major determinant of nitrogen availability in this strongly Mediterranean climate.

AB Twenty-one lime trial sites in the south-western agricultural region of Western Australia (WA) ranging in duration from 2 to 15 years were sampled in 1995 to a depth of 40 cm in 10-cm increments. In each case, samples were taken from both control plots and those with highest lime rates; additionally, samples were taken from plots with intermediate lime rates at 3 trial locations. Lime had been incorporated at rates of 2-12 t/ha within the top 0-10 cm layer at 20 of the sites, and at 15 t/ha within 0-20 cm at the remaining site. The following measurements were made: all samples, pH (1 : 5 0.01 M CaCl2) and exchangeable cations (1 : 10 0.1 M BaCl2); selected depths, undissolved carbonate; selected samples, total Ca (1 : 10 0.2 M HCl) and exchangeable Ca (1 : 10 0.1 M BaCl2 buffered to pH 8.2).
   The pH of the unlimed subsurface was between 4.0 and 4.5 at 10-20 cm for 15 sites, at 20-30 cm for 7 sites, and at 30-40 cm for 2 sites. In addition, 3 of the unlimed sites had a pH 4.0 at all of these depths. Where lime had been applied, the pH was significantly (P < 0.05) higher than in the controls by at least 0.2 units for 13 sites at depths of 10 cm below the depth of lime incorporation. The same significantly elevated pH was found for 5 sites at depths of 20 cm and for 4 sites at depths of 30 cm. At 5 sites that had also been sampled 3 years previously, the subsurface pH had increased within 4-7 years of liming with 2.5-5 t/ha. Where added lime could be accounted for, the amount of lime added explained 65% of the variation in the residual lime effect at a depth of 10-40 cm. Over all of the wheatbelt trials this represented an average downward movement of lime to a maximum depth of 40 cm of at least 8.3 kg/ha. year. t CaCO3 applied (range 0-22.5). Increased exchangeable Ca corresponded with a decrease in other base cations in only 2 trials. Decreases in exchangeable Al corresponded with increases in both pH and exchangeable Ca, but were less than the Ca increases. Precipitation of exchangeable Al represented an average of about one-sixth of the pH buffering capacity.
   Mass balance for Ca was achieved in 11 out of 20 cases in the wheatbelt, if Ca loss as nitrate was assumed to occur at rates of leaching published for WA. Lime recovery on the basis of pH increase was lower. The quantity of lime accounted for by Ca in the added and the residual undissolved lime, plus the increase in exchangeable Ca, ranged from <10% to >90%, with <50% in 9 of 19 cases at 15 trials. Nonexchangeable Ca in HCl extracts of a subset of surface samples was from 1% to 60% of Ca not accounted for. In 6 cases the Ca deficit exceeded plausible rates of acidification, and at 2 of these marked decreases of about 1 t/ha undissolved CaCO3 corresponded with episodes of high wind speed and observations of soil erosion. The implications of possible losses of lime by erosion are discussed.

AB In the South American savanna, no-tillage (NT) is implemented to improve the sustainability of cropping systems. At the beginning of the rainy season, however, more plant nutrients may be leached under NT than under conventional tillage (CT) because of more pronounced organic matter mineralisation and increased pore continuity. To test this hypothesis, we analysed the chemical composition of the soil solution under conventional (CT) and no-tillage (NT) soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) fields in the Brazilian savanna (Cerrados).
   We collected the soil solution at 0.15, 0.3, 0.8, 1.2, and 2 m depth and the precipitation in 1- to 3-day intervals from 28 October to 23 December 1998 on plots under CT and NT, replicated 3 times. We determined pH, electrical conductivity (EC), Ca, K, Mg, Na, NO3-, NH4+, Cl-, and total organic carbon (TOC) concentrations in soil solution and precipitation.
   Soil solution pH under NT was 0.3-0.8 units lower than under CT and was inversely related to TOC concentrations (average under NT, 1.02; CT, 0.70 mmol C/L) at all depths. Average Cl-, Ca, and Mg concentrations at 0.15-0.3 m depth were significantly higher under CT (1.09, 1.1, and 0.25 mmol/L) than under NT (0.50, 0.83, and 0.17 mmol/L), respectively. No difference was observed in average Na (0.09 mmol/L) and NO3- concentrations (2.2 mmol/L) between CT and NT. At 0.8-2 m, average NO3- (0.30 mmol/L), Cl- (0.18 mmol/L), Ca (0.19 mmol/L), Mg (0.05 mmol/L), and Na (0.04 mmol/L) concentrations under CT were significantly lower than under NT (NO3-, 0.38; Cl-, 0.40; Ca, 0.23; Mg, 0.09; Na, 0.06 mmol/L). In the monitored period, the Cl- which had accumulated during the dry season and which was applied with KCl fertiliser on 29 October reached a depth of 0.3 m under CT and of 1.2 m under NT.
   The results suggest higher mineralisation rates and faster leaching in the NT than in the CT systems, being the combined result of different plowing practices and different cropping sequences.

AB The interactions of the 4 basic soil physical properties-volumetric water content, matric potential, soil strength, and air-filled porosity-were investigated over a range of contrasting textures and for 3 compaction levels of 4 forest soils in New Zealand, using linear and non-linear regression methods. Relationships among these properties depended on texture and bulk density. Soil compaction increased volumetric water contents at field capacity, at wilting point, and at the water contents associated with restraining soil strength values, but decreased the water content when air-filled porosity was limiting. The integrated effect of matric potential, air-filled porosity, and soil strength on plant growth was described by the single parameter, least limiting water range (LLWR). LLWR defines a range in soil water content within which plant growth is least likely to be limited by the availability of water and air in soil and the soil strength. Soil compaction narrowed or decreased LLWR in most cases. In coarse sandy soil, initial compaction increased LLWR, but further compaction decreased LLWR. LLWR is sensitive to variations in forest management practices and is a potential indicator of soil physical condition for sustainable forest management.

AB Over recent years regulatory authorities in New Zealand have promoted irrigation of dairy farm effluent (DFE) onto the land, to protect surface water quality. The rate at which the resistant organic matter from DFE accumulates in the soil and the effect of any accumulation on other soil organic matter (SOM) related pools, such as microbial biomass, are, however, unknown. This information is necessary to determine the long-term impact and sustainability of land-applied DFE.
   In this paper we report on changes over 4 years in organic carbon (C-org) and total nitrogen (N-t) from a soil receiving a high application rate of DFE. Soil microbial biomass (C-mic) measurements were also included to test the hypothesis that C-mic or the C-mic/C-org ratio can be used as an early indicator of changes in SOM.
   The regular irrigation with DFE at the high rates used in this study increased the C-mic, pH, C-org, and N-t of the soil receiving the effluent. The time series of C-mic showed that this measurement is suitable as an early indicator of changes in C-org and N-t, whereas a single determination of the C-mic/C-org ratio was not.
   The sustainability of DFE application onto land in terms of N leaching can be maintained only when the supply of inorganic N is continually matched by the demand of the pasture. This means that inorganic N fertilisation has to be reduced concurrently with the gradually increasing N mineralisation from the accumulating organic matter.

AB In savannas, degrading trends such as increasing woody cover are caused by livestock ranging. Hence, identifying sustainable utilisation intensities is crucial for range management. However, knowledge concerning herbivory effects on herbaceous vegetation and primary productivity, but also productivity of and foraging on woody vegetation (browsing) is incomplete. Consequences of these knowledge gaps for predictions of long-term herbivory impacts are analysed by exploring a set of herbivory models in the framework of a spatially explicit simulator of vegetation dynamics in a semiarid savanna. We distinguish herbaceous and woody vegetation, and two impacts of herbivory, namely on phytomass and on primary productivity. Herbaceous phytomass is consumed under all grazing models, which are distinct by effects on herbaceous productivity per unit ground area: none; direct effect on productivity; direct effects on productivity and survival. Browsing is either absent or present. Additionally, low and high spatial grazing heterogeneity are distinguished. For a time scale of 100 years, herbivory impacts were analysed in a simulation experiment over a range of low to high stocking rates. Without effects on primary productivity, herbivory showed no long-term impact on shrub cover. However, under higher stocking rates, mean herbage utilisation reached over 50% of herbaceous phytomass production, rendering the null hypothesis on productivity effects of herbivory unrealistic. When grass productivity was affected by herbivory, shrub cover showed a threshold response to utilisation intensity: at low subcritical intensities, shrub cover did not exceed the low initial values; above a threshold intensity, savanna vegetation was characterised by high shrub cover. The level of this threshold was affected by heterogeneity, browsing, and by the nature of the productivity effects, and also depended on the time span considered. Since sustainable livestock ranging is possible only at utilisation intensities below this threshold, its determinants are crucial for long-term assessments. Given the insufficient quantitative understanding of all three of the factors determining long-term herbivory impacts, our results suggest caution towards current predictions, and provide for a priority ranking in urgently needed further research.

ID CANCER PREVENTION
AB Micronutrient deficiencies affect nearly half the world's population, impairing child development, reducing work productivity, and increasing mortality and morbidity rates by affecting both infectious and chronic diseases. To feed a growing world, it will be necessary to consider agriculture in the broad context of a food system as an instrument of public health and, thus, to address nutrient balance while also seeking sustainability. Such efforts would include increasing cropping system diversity, enhancing micronutrient outputs and promoting environmental sustainability. Example of this approach are presented for the essential trace element selenium (Se), which at high intakes can reduce cancer risks but is deficient in many parts of the world. Food systems-based approaches are discussed for preventing Se deficiency by enhancing intakes of any of several biologically available forms of Se, and for reducing cancer risk by enhancing intakes of forms of the element that support anti-tumorigenic Se-metabolites.

AB Ecological problems associated with current antifouling technologies have increased interest in the natural strategies that marine organisms use to keep their surfaces clean and free from fouling. Bacteria isolated from living surfaces in the marine environment have been shown to produce chemicals that are potential antifoulants. Active compounds from the cells and culture supernatant of two bacterial strains, FS-55 and NudMB50-11, isolated from surface of the seaweed, Fucus serratus, and the nudibranch, Archidoris pseudoargus, respectively, were extracted using solid phase extraction. The extracts were combined with acrylic base paint resin and assayed for antifouling activity by measuring their ability to inhibit the growth of fouling bacteria. These formulations were found to be active against fouling bacteria isolated from marine surfaces. The formulation of antifouling paints that incorporate marine microbial natural products is reported here for the first time. This is a significant advance towards the production of an environmentally friendly antifouling paint that utilises a sustainable supply of natural biodegradable compounds.

AB Results from experimental trials and on-farm surveys have suggested that organic farm management is associated with positively enhanced soil physical, chemical and biological characteristics. To test this hypothesis more rigorously, 30 paired organic and conventional farms were assessed across a range of soil types and management regimes in the south of England. The 60 paired farms ranged from grassland to horticultural/arable and purely arable. The soils of all chosen farms were measured for a wide range of physical and chemical characteristics. The data were subjected to a multivariate analysis and the results interpreted so as to identify the management factors deemed beneficial for topsoil physical and nutritional conditions.
   The results showed that farm types could be most effectively characterized by organic matter, aggregate stability, humic acid, infra-red absorbance and pH and that these differentiated organically and conventionally managed arable and horticultural farms. Pasture farms showed no significant differences between organic and conventional management. Conventional horticultural farms showed the lowest values for soil organic matter, aggregate stability, cation exchange capacity and E-4/E-6 ratio. Organic horticultural farms had the highest mean humic acid content, infra-red absorbance, air capacity and available water capacity. Infra-red absorbance values showed a clear age trend for humic acid, with older humic acids seen For pasture farms. Management factors deemed most important in differentiating between conventional and organic management included frequent farmyard manure applications to horticultural land and the inclusion of grass leys in arable rotations. Some of the soil measurements are suggested as potentially effective indicators of sustainability for farm systems.

AB Major objectives of this study were to evaluate the effects of organic, conventional and integrated orchard fruit production systems on the quality and quantity of soil organic matter in orchard floors and to identify sensitive soil organic matter indicators. Seventeen different soil organic matter parameters were studied. These were soil aggregate stability (AS), total nitrogen (TN), total carbon (TC), carbon/nitrogen ratio, microbial biomass N (BN), microbial biomass C (BC), BC:BN; BC:TC; BN:TN; hot-water extractable C (HC), hot-water extractable carbohydrate (HCA), HCA:HC; humin N (hum N), humin C (hum C), hum C:TC; hum N:TN and potentially mineralizable N (Pot N). They were based largely on soil organic matter characteristics and fractions extracted sequentially by different extractants from soils collected from the alleys and treelines of organic, conventional, and integrated grassed-down apple orchard types from both commercial and experimental sites in Canterbury, New Zealand. A total of 12 apple orchards were investigated. Soil samples collected From these orchards (0-75 mm depth) were analysed for TC, TN, BC, BN, Pot N, AS and also sequentially extracted for labile and stable soil organic matter fractions using cold and hot water, acid mixtures (hydrochloric:hydroflouric acids, HCl:HF) and alkalis (sodium pyrophosphate and sodium hydroxide, Na4P2O7 and NaOH). Only TN, BN, and BN:TN showed significant interaction effects and all these were associated with soil N. Overall, combining orchards according to similar management systems, results obtained showed no significant differences between experimental and commercial orchards. However, sensitive indicators capable of distinguishing significant differences between different orchard management systems were BC, BC:TC and HCA:HC while HCA:HC distinguished significantly between treelines and alleys within each group of the same orchard type.

AB Lack of information about the specific environmental adaptation of cover crop species remains a serious constraint in the efficient design of agronomic experiments examining options for more suitable and more sustainable management of hillside farming systems in the tropics. Predictive models of crop phenology for cover crop species exist but how robust these are for legume cover crop species is largely unproven. We determined the predictive ability of phenological models, derived from glasshouse studies and driven by temperature and photoperiod, across a diverse range of cover crop genotypes and tropical hillside environments. The models were designed to predict the duration from germination to first flowering, and from first flowering to first pod maturity. Seeds of eleven legume species of cover and/or green manure crops collected from different hillside locations world-wide were sown in two groups of nurseries (tropical short-day plants in early summer and sub-tropical long-day plants in early winter) at Kabale and Namulonge in Uganda, Godavari and Lumle in Nepal, Cochabamba in Bolivia, Zamorano in Honduras, and Valenca in Brazil. Dates of sowing, first flowering and first pod maturity were taken and daily temperature data were recorded at each site. Similar observations for the same genotypes were available from independent experiments conducted at Islamabad, Pakistan, Hattiban, Nepal and at three locations in Cyprus. Model predictions wen compared with field observations. The proportion of variation accounted for in the period from sowing to first pod maturity was 88% and 89% for the short-day and the long-day groups of genotypes, respectively. Likewise, the average difference from sowing to pod maturity between the model predictions and the field observations was 6.3% and 7.9% for the combined short-day species and the combined long-day species, respectively. It is clear that the model predictions, for this dataset at least, an sufficiently robust to serve as a filter for determining the environmental suitability of germplasm.

AB Biomass for energy conversion is usually considered as a local resource. With appropriate logistic systems, access to biomass can be improved over a large geographical area. In this study, life cycle inventory (LCI) has been used as a method to investigate the environmental load of selected bioenergy transport chains. As a case study, chains starting in Sweden and ending in Holland have been investigated. Biomass originates from tree sections or forest residues, the latter upgraded to bales or pellets. The study is concentrated on production of electricity, hot cooling water is considered as a loss. Electricity is, in the case study, produced from solid biomass in the importing country. Electricity can also be produced in the country of origin and exported via the transnational grid as transportation medium. The results show that emissions from long range transportation, 1200 km, performed with ships, is of minor importance compared to emissions from local bioenergy systems in a local market. In bioenergy systems the use of fuels and electricity for operating machines and transportation carriers requires a net energy input which amounts to typically 7-9% of delivered electrical energy from the system. Emissions of key substances such as NOx, CO, S, hydrocarbons, and particles are low in a perspective of sustainability. Emissions of CO2 from bio-combustion are considered to be zero since there is approximately no net contribution of carbon to the biosphere in an energy system based on biomass. The results indicate that biomass for energy can be transported from Scandinavia to Holland without losing its environmental benefits. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB An empirical study on the non-timber forest products (NTFPs) in three tribal villages on the Eastern Ghats of India was made during 1994-95. These village ecosystems - Rajikakhola, Nediguda and Badruguda - are situated in the Phulbani district of Orissa and are inhabited by the Kondh tribe. The average annual production of important non-timber forest products (NTFPs) was 1.87 t (26.78 GJ) of mohua flower, 2.96 t (54.41 GJ) of siali leaf, 6.73 t (107.06 GJ) of thatch grass, 4.2 t (8.01 GJ) of sage palm sap and 0.93 t (11.39 GJ) of tamarind pulp per village. Total production of NTFPs was 253.55 GJ per village. Total consumption of NTFPs was 190.57 GJ per village. However, average household consumption was 9.60 GJ. Annual country liquor consumption was 2287 l per village, out of which a total of 762 l was prepared locally and the rest imported. Total annual export of NTFPs was 3.69 t (61.47 GJ) per village, maximum being by Rajikakhola. Among the exported products siali leaf ranked highest. Total human energy expended for collection of NTFP was 16.1 GJ per village, out of which men contributed 37.3%, women 53.8% and children 8.9% in these villages. The average input-output ratio of energy for NTFP was 16.56. For sustainable development of tribal villages, conservation and proper management of existing forests, minimisation of waste and increase of the value of products through efficient processing are highly essential.

AB Biomass utilisation for energy production presently faces an uphill battle against fossil fuels. The use of biomass must offer additional benefits to compensate for higher pl ices: on the basis of a life cycle assessment (using BEAM to evaluate a variety of integrated bioenergy systems in connection with the Sustainable Process Index as a highly aggregated environmental pressure index) it is shown that integrated bioenergy systems are superior to fossil fuel systems in terms of environmental compatibility. The implementation of sustainability measures provides additional valuable information that might help in constructing and optimising integrated bioenergy systems. For a set of reference processes, among them fast pyrolysis, atmospheric gasification, integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC), combustion and steam cycle (CS) and conventional hydrolysis, a detailed impact assessment is shown. Sensitivity analyses of the most important ecological parameters are calculated, giving an overview of the impacts of various stages in the total life cycle and showing 'what really matters'. Much of the ecological impact of integrated bioenergy systems is induced by feedstock production. It is mainly the use of fossil fuels in cultivation, harvesting and transportation as well as the use of fertilisers in short-rotation coppice production that impose considerable ecological pressure. Concerning electricity generation the most problematic pressures are due to gaseous emissions, most notably the release of NOx. Moreover, a rather complicated process thigh amount of grey energy) and the use of fossil pilot fuel (co-combustion) leads to a rather weak ecological performance in contrast to other 100% biomass-based systems.

AB Concerns about global climate change and air quality have increased interest in biomass and other energy sources that are potentially COz-neutral and less polluting. Large-scale bioenergy development could indeed bring significant ecological benefits - or equally significant damage - depending on the specific paths taken. In particular, the land requirements for biomass production are potentially immense.
   Various entities in the United States have performed research; prepared cost-supply assessments, environmental impact assessments, life cycle analyses and externality impact assessments; and engaged in demonstration and development regarding biomass crops and other potential biomass energy feedstocks. These efforts have focused on various biomass wastes, forest management issues, and biomass crops, including both perennial herbaceous crops and fast-growing woody crops. Simultaneously, several regional and national groups of bioenergy stakeholders have issued consensus recommendations and guidelines for sustainable bioenergy development.
   It is a consistent conclusion from these efforts that displacing annual agricultural crops with native perennial biomass crops could - in addition to reducing fossil fuel use and ameliorating associated ecological problems also help restore natural ecosystem functions in worked landscapes, and thereby preserve natural biodiversity.
   Conversely, if forests are managed and harvested more intensively - and/or if biomass crops displace more natural land cover such as forests and wetlands - it is likely that ecosystem functions would be impaired and biodiversity lost. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Euterpe edulis (Martius) is a single-stemmed, abundant Neotropical palm of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest (Mata Atlantica). The species produces the heart of palm, locally called palmito, which is an important source of income For forest owners. Because of its high market value, its short-term demands of the forest environment, and its important interactions with animal species, this palm is suitable for sustainable management and conservation purposes. In this paper, we present the results from a 15-year investigation of this species, synthesizing results on its demography, seed dispersion, reproductive biology, genetics, and economics. We have linked these results in a proposal for the species' sustainable management and conservation.

ID SPECIES RICHNESS; ASSEMBLAGES
AB The Atlantic Forest region (wide sense) includes very complex tropical environments, increasingly threatened by extensive anthropogenic conversion (> 30%). Ecologically specialized, short-generation insects (butterflies) are evaluated here as indicators for monitoring community richness, landscape integrity, and sustainable resource use in the region. The > 2100 butterfly species in the Atlantic Forest region have been censused in many sites over 35 years, giving comparable daily, weekly, monthly, and long-term site lists. The 21 most thoroughly studied sites include 218-914 species, of which half can be censused in a week or less. The butterfly communities are divided into six relatively distinct faunal regions, centered in the northeast, the central coastal tablelands, the southeast coastal plain, the mountains plus interior of the southeastern states, the central plateau, and the southern states. Species richness shows the highest values in coastal mountains from 15 to 23 degreesS. Local butterfly communities show a high turnover, with 20 to 40 percent of the species, especially small Lycaenidae and Hesperiidae, recorded only as unstable populations or "tourists." Easily sampled species in the family Nymphalidae, and especially its bait-attracted subfamilies, are best correlated with the entrire butterfly fauna and can be used as surrogates for species diversity In most butterfly groups, species richness is well predicted by landscape connectivity alone, or by composite indices of environmental heterogeneity, natural disturbance, and (negatively) anthropogenic disturbance. Principal components and redundancy analyses showed that the richness and proportions of different butterfly groups in the local fauna are variably explained by disturbance, seasonality, temperature, vegetation, soils, and landscape connectivity. Various groups thus can be used as rapid indicators of different types of change in the community, its environment, and the landscape. Threatened and rare species also can be used as indicators of the most unique Atlantic Forest communities (paleoenvironments), which need special attention.

DE multiobjective optimization; shelter for all; resources; emissions;
   strategies
AB If providing a decent shelter is an immediate concern for developing countries, the reduction of global emissions such as carbon dioxide is a cause of concern for industrialized countries. A short focused policy prescription for a country like India would be to provide a decent shelter for its more than 15% citizens, who do not have adequate housing. However, a sustainable path would be to develop a well strategized path to meet current needs of housing and also to reduce absolute contribution to global emissions through those construction techniques which are environment friendly. We develop an optimization framework to analyse a sustainable path to meet housing shortages in India, considering that the sustainable path should not be at the cost of engineering design criteria. The criteria to measure sustainability in this paper is cost effectiveness, efficient utilization of resources and environment friendliness. A computer model called 'MHOPE' has been developed to estimate resources and construction techniques required to achieve housing for all in India. The technologies incorporated in the model are suitable for India, however, the model can be upgraded to include the house construction technologies suitable for any other country of interest. The results indicate that it is not possible to provide housing for all in India with the present set of construction techniques which are predominantly cement and brick based. However, if low cost housing techniques, which use locally available materials, are used, we can achieve this target of 'Shelter for all'. It will not only reduce cost, but also reduce CO2 emissions because locally available materials are less energy intensive. The paper quantifies the level of investment, resources and employment required to provide shelter for all. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. Ail rights reserved.

AB A review of the available evidence for the associations between environmental sanitation and transmission of trachoma was undertaken with a view to identifying preventive interventions. The WHO Global Alliance for the Elimination of Trachoma by the Year 2020 (GET2020) has adopted the "SAFE" strategy, consisting of four components: Surgery, Antibiotic treatment, promotion of Facial cleanliness and initiation of Environmental changes.
   This review of 19 studies selected from the 39 conducted in different parts of the world shows that there is clear evidence to support the recommendation of facial cleanliness and environmental improvements (i.e. the F and E components of the SAFE strategy) to prevent trachoma. Person-to-person contact and flies appear to constitute the major transmission pathways. Improvement of personal and community hygiene has great potential for a sustainable reduction in trachoma transmission. Controlled clinical trials are needed to estimate the relative contribution of various elements to the risk of transmission of trachoma and the effectiveness of different interventions. These could show the relative attributable risks and effectiveness of interventions to achieve improvement of personal hygiene and fly control by environmental improvements, alone or in combination, and with or without antibiotic treatment.

AB In the fight against the HIV/AIDS pandemic different approaches can be distinguished, reflecting professional backgrounds, world views and political interests. One important distinction is between the biomedical and the development paradigms. The biomedical paradigm is characterized by individualization and the concept of "risk". This again is related to the concept of the market where health is a product of services and progress a series of new discoveries that can be marketed. The development paradigm is characterized by participation of the different stakeholders and by community work. The concept "vulnerability" is important in the development paradigm and emphasis is placed on efforts to decrease this vulnerability in a variety of sustainable ways. Biomedical technology is definitely one of the tools in these efforts. In the beginning of the pandemic the biomedical approach was important for the discovery of the virus and understanding its epidemiology. Later, stakeholders became involved. In the light of absence of treatment or vaccines, the development paradigm became more important and the two approaches were more in balance. However, since the reports about effective treatment of AIDS and hope of development of vaccines, the biomedical paradigm has become a leading principle in many HIV/AIDS prevention programmes. There is a need for a better balance between the two paradigms. Especially in developing countries, where it is not realistic to think that sustainable biomedical interventions can be organized on a short-term basis, it would be counterproductive to base our efforts to deal with HIV/AIDS exclusively on the biomedical approach.

AB In 1988 the 41st World Health Assembly committed WHO to the goal of global eradication of poliomyelitis by 2000 "in ways which strengthen national immunization programmes and health infrastructure". The successful use of polio National Immunization Days (NIDs) to deliver vitamin A is an example of how polio eradication can serve as a platform to address other problems of child health. Importantly, this integration is helping to achieve the World Summit for Children goal of eliminating Vitamin A deficiency by the year 2000. It is estimated that between 140 million and 250 million preschool children are at risk of subclinical vitamin A deficiency. In 1998 more than 60 million children at risk received Vitamin A supplements during polio national immunization days (NIDs). While food fortification and dietary approaches are fu nda mental to combating vitamin A deficiency, the administration of vitamin A supplements during NIDs helps raise awareness, enhance technical capacity, improve assessment and establish a reporting system. Moreover, polio NIDs provide an entry point for the sustainable provision of vitamin A supplements with routine immunization services and demonstrate how immunization campaigns can be used for the delivery of other preventive health services.

AB Globalization of trade, marketing and investment has import ant implications for public health, both negative and positive. This article considers the implications of the single package of World Trade Organization (WTO) agreements for public health research and policy, focusing on three themes: commodities, intellectual property rights, and health services. The main aims of the analysis are as follows: to identify how trade issues are associated with the transnationalization of health risks and possible benefits; to identity key areas of research; and to suggest policy-relevant advice and interventions on trade and health issues. The next wave of international trade law will need to take more account of global public health issues. However, to become more engaged in global trade debates, the public health community must gain an understanding of the health effects of global trade agreements. It must also ensure that its own facts are correct, so that public health is not blindly used for political ends, such as justifying unwarranted economic protectionism. "Healthy trade" policies, based on firm empirical evidence and designed to improve health status, are an important step towards reaching a more sustainable form of trade liberalization.

TI Validation of spot-testing kits to determine iodine content in salt

AB Iodine deficiency disorders are a major public health problem, and salt iodization is the most widely practised intervention for their elimination. For the intervention to be successful and sustainable, it is vital to monitor the iodine content of salt regularly. Iodometric titration, the traditional method for measuring iodine content, has problems related to accessibility and cost. The newer spot-testing kits are inexpensive, require minimal training, and provide immediate results. Using data from surveys to assess the availability of iodized salt in two states in India, Madhya Pradesh and the National Capital Territory of Delhi, we tested the suitability of such a kit in field situations. Salt samples from Delhi were collected from 30 schools, chosen using the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) cluster sampling technique. A single observer made the measurement for iodine content using the kit. Salt samples from Madhya Pradesh were from 30 rural and 30 urban clusters, identified by using census data and the EPI cluster sampling technique. In each cluster, salt samples were collected from 10 randomly selected households and all retailers. The 15 investigators performing the survey estimated the iodine content of salt samples in the field using the kit. Ail the samples were brought to the central laboratory in Delhi, where iodine content was estimated using iodometric titration as a reference method. The agreement between the kit and titration values decreased as the number of observers increased. Although sensitivity was not much affected by the increase in the number of observers (93.3% for a single observer and 93.9% for multiple observers), specificity decreased sharply (90.4% for a single observer and 40.4% for multiple observers). Due to the low specificity and resulting high numbers of false-positives for the kit when used by multiple observers ("real-life situations"), kits were likely to consistently overestimate the availability of iodized salt. This overestimation could result in complacency. Therefore, we conclude that until a valid alternative is available, the titration method should be used for monitoring the iodine content of salt at all levels, from producer to consumer,to ensure effectiveness of the programme.

AB The biological and physical environment of the planet is changing at an unprecedented rate as a result of human activity, and these changes may have an enormous impact on human health. One of the goals of human development is to protect health in the face of rapid environmental change, but we often fail to do this. The aim in th is paper is to distinguish between socioeconomic aspects of development that a re likely to be protective and those that are likely to increase vulnerability (the capacity for loss resulting from environmental change). Examples include climate change in the Pacific. We conclude that protecting human health in a changing world requires us to take steps to minimize harmful change wherever possible, and at the same time to be prepared for surprises. The goals of mitigation (reducing or preventing change) and adaptation (response to change) are not mutually exclusive. in fact, steps to make populations more resilient in the face of change are often similar to those that are needed to lighten the load on the environment. We need social policies that convert economic growth into human development. Wider application of sustainable development concepts is part of the solution. In particular, there is a need to promote health as an essential asset of poor and vulnerable populations. it is their key to productivity and to surviving shocks; it is also the key to achieving broader development goals such as universal education. For these reasons it is in the interests of all sectors - economic, social and environmental - to play their particular roles in protecting and improving health.

AB The efficacies of using residual house spraying and insecticide-treated nets against malaria vectors are compared, using data from six recent comparisons in Africa, Asia and Melanesia. By all the entomological and malariological criteria recorded, pyrethroid-treated nets were at least as efficacious as house spraying with dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), malathion or a pyrethroid. However, when data from carefully monitored house spraying projects carried out between the 1950s and 1970s at Pare-Taveta and Zanzibar (United Republic of Tanzania), Kisumu (Kenya) and Garki (Nigeria) are compared with recent insecticide-treated net trials with apparently similar vector populations, the results with the insecticide-treated nets were much less impressive. Possible explanations include the longer duration of most of the earlier spraying projects and the use of non-irritant insecticides. Non-irritant insecticides may yield higher mosquito mortalities than pyrethroids, which tend to make insects leave the site of treatment (i.e. are excito-repellent). Comparative tests with non-irritant insecticides, including their use on nets, are advocated. The relative costs and sustainability of spraying and of insecticide-treated net operations are briefly reviewed for villages in endemic and epidemic situations and in camps for displaced populations. The importance of high population coverage is emphasized, and the advantages of providing treatment free of charge, rather than charging individuals, are pointed out.

AB Introduction Sustainable control of malaria in sub-Saharan Africa is jeopardized by dwindling public health resources resulting from competing health priorities that include an overwhelming acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) epidemic. In Mpumalanga province, South Africa, rational planning has historically been hampered by a case surveillance system for malaria that only provided estimates of risk at the magisterial district level (a subdivision of a province).
   Methods To better map control programme activities to their geographical location, the malaria notification system was overhauled and a geographical information system implemented. The introduction of a simplified notification form used only for malaria and a carefully monitored notification system provided the good quality data necessary to support an effective geographical information system.
   Results The geographical information system displays data on malaria cases at a village or town level and has proved valuable in stratifying malaria risk within those magisterial districts at highest risk, Barberton and Nkomazi. The conspicuous west- to-east gradient, in which the risk rises sharply towards the Mozambican border (relative risk = 4.12, 95% confidence interval = 3.88-4.46 when the malaria risk within 5 km of the border was compared with the remaining areas in these two districts), allowed development of a targeted approach to control.
   Discussion The geographical information system for malaria was enormously valuable in enabling malaria risk at town and village level to be shown. Matching malaria control measures to specific strata of endemic malaria has provided the opportunity for more efficient malaria control in Mpumalanga province.

AB In the early summer of 1993-1995, a survey was conducted in central Ontario to determine the amount of road kill of Snapping Turtles during their nesting period. Peak nesting occurred during mid June in all three years. The annual mortality of Snapping Turtles during this period was 30.5% of all observed turtles. Only 24% of the dead snapping turtles sampled were mature females. Snapping Turtle road mortality during the nesting period was high and could have negative impacts on the sustainability of local populations.

AB Genetic diversity is a prerequisite for plant adaptation and maintenance of a sustainable ecosystem. Not much information is available on the genetic diversity of woody species on the semi-arid Canadian prairies. We used RAPD fragments to assess the diversity of four woody species of the Elaeagnaceae family, sea buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides L.), Russian olive (Elaeagnus angustifolia L.), buffaloberry (Shepherdia argentea Nutt.) and silverberry (Elaeagnus commutata Bernh. Ex Rydb.) collected from several locations in southwestern Saskatchewan. The RAPD fragments were used to generate molecular data for this experiment. Of the total scorable RAPD fragments, 86, 80, 55.2, and 36.5% were polymorphic in sea buckthorn, buffaloberry, silverberry and Russian olive, respectively. Estimates of phenotypic diversity by AMOVA and Shanon's information index revealed that buffaloberry and sea buckthorn had relatively high phenotypic diversity and Russian olive had low phenotypic diversity.

AB The objective of this study was to determine the impact of a range of management systems on weed communities in cropped fields on farms in Saskatchewan. Farms (n = 28) with management systems defined by a combination of different cropping histories and chemical input levels were selected. Fields were surveyed on each farm in 1995, 1996, and 1997 after any post-emergent weed control to ensure that their weed communities reflected the impact of all agronomic management practices typical of the management system. Canonical correspondence analysis was used to determine whether weed communities were significantly correlated with management system after removal of variance due to ecoregion and year. The largest difference in weed communities attributable to fanning system was between the systems with annual cropping histories and those that included perennials in the cropping history. Thus, the life history of the weeds reflected the life history of the crops. Herbicide use was correlated with the next largest difference between systems. A significant association between weed communities and different management systems indicates that weed species are being selected for by these systems. If such selection pressure continues, these species may become a threat to the system's sustainability.

ID INDUSTRIALIZED COUNTRIES; AGRICULTURAL GROWTH; EFFICIENCY CHANGE;
   CONVERGENCE; REFORMS; INDUSTRY; PROGRESS; NUMBERS
AB Since the initiative of economic reform in the late 1970s, the Chinese economy has sustained a continuously high rate of annual growth. This seemingly miraculous growth has attracted the attention of many economists in the world. in particular, major efforts have been made to examine the role of efficiency and productivity in economic growth in the postreform mainland Chinese economy and hence, to understand whether China's economic growth is sustainable or not. However, most previous studies have focused only on the industrial or agricultural sectors, perhaps due to the limitation of statistics. This paper presents an economy-wide study and hence attempts to fil the void in the literature. A stochastic frontier method is used to estimate productivity growth, which is decomposed into two components: technological progress and efficiency change. The former refers to shifts in the frontier and the latter to movement towards the frontier. Applying the newly released regional GDP data, this study aims to: (1) examine the contribution of productivity to economic growth in China, (2) investigate the sources of productivity growth in the reforming Chinese economy, and (3) shed some light on the trend of convergence and catch-up in terms of productivity performance among China's regional economies in the 1980s and 1990s.

SO CHINA OCEAN ENGINEERING

   disaster prevention criteria
AB In China, estuarine and coastal cities are mostly regional economic development centers. The disasters by combined effect of upper reach flood, storm surge and typhoon waves are primary obstacles to the economic development of such cities. Thus the risk analysis and system analysis of flood-storm surge-wave disaster, economic loss and flood-storm surge control measures play a very important role in the sustainable development of coastal cities. There are three types of coastal cities for consideration. The first type of city is like Tianjin. The most significant damage is from the upper reach flood. The effect of storm surge is negligible, because in the estuary of the Haihe River, tidal locks are built. The Grey Markov Model (GMM) is used to forecast the flood peak level GMM combines the Grey system and the Markov theory into a high-precision model The predicted flood peak levels are close to the measured data. A synthetic model is established for economic assessment, risk analysis and flood-control benefit estimation As a new contribution, a stochastic simulation technique is used to compute risk probability. At the same time, consideration is given to the effect of correlation between variables on risk probability. The second type of city is like Shanghai, where sometimes the combined effect of river flood peak and set storm surge is the most severe disaster. The water level of a 1000 yr. return period of the Huangpu river is used as the design criterion. The simulated combined water level of flood peak, storm surge and maximum astronomical tidal level of a 400 yr. return period is close to the conventional design water level of a return period of 1000 years. The third type of city is Like Qingdao, where the combined effect of the maximum astronomical tide, storm surge and waves bring about the most significant damage. With the stochastic simulation technique, different combinations of storm surge and waves at the 1% and 2% joint probability level are simulated for disaster prevention.

ID LINEAR-PROGRAMMING APPROACH; WATER-QUALITY MANAGEMENT
AB This paper proposes an inexact multi-objective mixed integer programming (IMOMIP) approach to deal with the uncertainty and complexity involved in decision making for regional sustainable development. The proposed model framework represents system uncertainty with interval numbers, and addresses complexity through a multi-objective optimization formulation. Inexact continuous and discrete decision variables are integrated, therefore enabling the optimal decision regarding sector activity and expansion of the sectors, WWTP, forests, etc., to be made within a holistic optimization framework. The proposed algorithm dissociates the control of each objective, thus allowing convenient interaction between the model and decision makers, as well as an efficient compromise between the competing objectives.
   The IMOMIP method is applied to the integrated economic environmental system planning for the Haichang Investment Zone (HIZ) in China, and solved under two scenarios. The difference between the two solutions indicates that decision makers' preference has significant influence on the model's behavior, However, both scenarios' solutions achieve reasonable compromise between all objectives, including economic benefit, water resources, and water and air quality, thus providing potential alternatives for sustainable development in the study area.

TI Integrated coastal management in the Philippines: Testing new paradigms
SO COASTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE collaborative management; integrated coastal management; Philippines
AB With fisheries declining, coral reefs battered, mangrove forests under threat, pollution levels rising, and coastal communities experiencing increased poverty, the Philippines faces severe challenges in managing its coastal resources. Coastal management efforts began in the Philippines more than 20 years ago through various community-based projects. Now, integrated coastal management is expanding in the country and holds the potential to reverse the trends. This article analyzes the situation in relation to new approaches for coastal management being undertaken through the Coastal Resource Management Project supported by the United States Agency for International Development implemented by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources. This project, drawing on the lessons generated by past and ongoing coastal management initiatives, is emphasizing integrated approaches to management over narrowly focused fisheries management and habitat protection efforts. It highlights the increasingly important role of local governments and the changing roles of national government to effectively support integrated coastal management. Multisectoral collaboration is explained as standard procedure to achieve outcomes that are broad based and sustainable. Local and national level activities are contrasted and shown as essential complements in building institutionalization of resources management within all levels of government. A practical result framework is explained for measuring relative success at the local government level of implementing best practices for coastal management. Finally, lessons being learned related to collaboration, level of focus, education, and communication; who is responsible, and expansion of the project are highlighted.

DE coastal; management; Philippines; review
AB Standardized and free-format questionnaires on the state of coastal management were fielded to coastal management practitioners during three workshops and a national feedback and recommendation workshop. The most commonly cited responses were identified for each of 13 political regions and overall trends were identified. Management frameworks frequently included research, community organizing, education, livelihood resource enhancement, resource protection, regulation, and net working components. Gender issues, documentation, and infrastructure investment were rare. The most commonly perceived environmental problem was illegal/destructive fishing and its associated overfishing and low fish catch. The most commonly cited socioeconomic problem was the inadequacy of law enforcement. The best monitored variables were usually those related to environmental management status and change of habitats, resources, and degree of enforcement/patrolling activities The most common nonregulatory enhancement, aside from environmental education (which is the most popular), was mangrove reforestation, In terms of regulations, the majority of the respondents have reportedly formulated an integrated coastal management plan. In practice, regulating destructive and illegal fishing practices and then the establishment of fish sanctuaries are the next most implemented The most popular quality-of-life enhancement strategies focused on the improvement of sustainable fishing as a livelihood and on a variety of supplementary livelihoods. The most usual institutional intervention being implemented was the setting lip of local community people's organizations. Major factors which may influence success or failure of coastal management and recommendations on research community organizing and livelihood, legislation and policies, implementation and coordination, and networking are also summarized.

AB Fishing communities, the Government of Thailand Department of Fisheries, local nongovermnental organizations, universities, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), and FAO's Bay of Bengal Program have undertaken a partnership in management of Phang-nga Bay's coastal resources. It is the first project of its kind in Thailand and although still in the early stages, offers insights that may contribute to our knowledge of how we can improve our management of coastal resources, including the importance of (1) building relationships within the governance process; (2) combining education, enforcement, and economic incentives to achieve compliance; (3) implementing solutions early: and (4) government support of community-based decisions. These insights reinforce trends emerging in other coastal management projects in the Asian region.

AB Site-based projects were initiated in Chawka Bay-Paje, Zanzibar, and Nyali-Bamburi-Shanzu, Kenya, to demonstrate the benefits of an integrated coastal management (ICM) approach for addressing coastal issues such as tourism development and enhancement of resource-dependent village economies in eastern Africa, A two-year, multidonor project used three primary strategies to make rapid brit sustainable, progress toward ICM. These included using interagency government teams for ICM planning, adopting an internationally recognized framework for ICM as a project "road map, " and explicitly incorporating capacity-building strategies into all aspects of the project. Within two years, integrated ICM action strategies, prepared through participatory processes, were being implemented at both sites, and both teams were working to expand the scale and scope of ICM in their nation. More importantly, the project helped create committed, capable, interagency groups that continue to work together to address urgent ICM issues.

DE integrated marine planning coral atoll
AB The Cocos (Keeling) Islands are located on an isolated atoll in the Indian Ocean and have a strong Malay culture owing to the translocation of a substantial plantation workforce in the early 19th century. The atoll became one of Australia's External Territories in 1955. Meeting the marine resource needs of the atoll residents within an Australian legislative system by formulating an integrated marine management plan presented several challenges. Key factors in drafting a culturally meaningful plan were a commitment to understanding and accommodating the cultural and subsistence needs of the community innovative communication strategies, and a simple approach to management. Development of the plan highlighted the limitations of current Australian marine planning legislation in cross-cultural settings and for sustainable development.

TI Microbial biomass phosphorus and its significance in predicting
   phosphorus availability in red soils
SO COMMUNICATIONS IN SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT ANALYSIS
LA English
DT Article
ID PHOSPHATE; PASTURE; CARBON
AB Red soils are widespread in Southern China and other subtropical regions in the world. An improved management of phosphorus (P) is crucial for sustainable agriculture and environmental quality in red soil regions. Plant-availability of P in red soils mainly depends on fertilization and biological cycling. Both laboratory analyses and greenhouse experiments were conducted to examine the relationships between plant P uptake, chemical index of P, and microbial biomass P in red soils with different fertility levels. Microbial biomass P ranged from 2.1 to 43 mg kg(-1) in the red soils and was significantly correlated with total P (r=0.84*), organic P (r-0.87*), or Bray I extractable P (r=0.94**). Extractable P plus organic carbon accounted for >85% of the variation in microbial biomass P in the red soils. The significant relationship between microbial biomass P and extractable P suggests that microbial biomass P has a great potential in predicting P-supply ability in soil. Greenhouse experiments showed that there were close relationships between ryegrass dry matter yield, plant P uptake or tissue P concentration and microbial biomass P in the red soils. The corresponding correlation coefficients were 0.79*, 0.90*, and 0.91*, respectively. These results imply that microbial biomass P plays an important role in the availability of P to plants, and is a potential biological index of P availability in the red soils.

TI Composition of soil lipids in two Chinampas agroecosystems from
   Xochimilco and Tlahuac Municipalities, Mexico
SO COMMUNICATIONS IN SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT ANALYSIS
LA English
DT Article
ID IRON
AB The Chinampas are important historically and represent a special agroecosystem that has been sustainable for many years. However, their agricultural potential has currently decreased mainly because of irrigation with waste water from Mexico City, leading to progressive salinity and alkalinity problems and the subsequent general alteration on the agroecosystem. Chemical composition of the main groups of lipid molecules in anthropogenic organic soil from Xochimilco and Tlahuac Municipalities (Mexico) were investigated. The analysis performed included physicochemical characteristics of the soil and the distribution analysis of free alkanes and fatty acids. The successive accumulation stages of organic materials in these anthropogenic organic soils represent a source of irregular distribution in organic carbon, likewise the concentration of lipid extracts differed noticeably with depth. There is a vertical variability, where hydromorphic environment has played a key role in this variability. The major compounds identified in the soil lipid extracts by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry include series of linear and satured alkanes, fatty acids, as well as individual components such as sterols and hopanes. Most of the lipid components in these soil seem to have a biogenic origin (higher plants and microorganism biomass).

AB One of the challenges of soil testing has been to develop rapid tests. Our ability to design new soil, plant and water analyses has progressed though the modern ages. One can argue the beginning of soil science, but this paper will address the progress in soil chemical fertility from the 1800's through to the present. From the first descriptions of physical and chemical methods for soil analysis until the present, there have been two requests from growers and field consultants. First, the process from sampling through reporting of the results must occur more rapidly. Second, the process must require less effort from the sampler and less material sampled. With the advent of modern computers, remote sensing tools, automated in-field data acquisition and automated application of amendments for crop production, there is constant pressure from the users of these tools to speed up the sampling and analytical process. These users have often requested non-destructive sampling and analysis plus recommendations for application of crop production amendments that can occur simultaneously. This paper will discuss the brief history of soil science and make predictions about the near future in relation to these demands of the end users of soil, plant and water analysis.

AB Whereas a generation ago, global starvation was the primary fear of agricultural strategists, now when food supplies are generally adequate, the World Health Organisation(WHO) has expressed increasing concern at the rise in incidence of micronutrient deficiencies in human populations in many countries. These deficiencies limit the physical and intellectual capacity of people, thereby restraining national development efforts, and adversely affecting the health and wellbeing of over half of the planet's human population. This nutritional crisis is likely to continue for the foreseeable future unless food systems are changed in ways that increase nutrient output and balance. Agriculture must deliver enough nutrients to sustain healthy and productive lives as well as focus on providing enough "food" to prevent starvation. Plant nutritionists and analysts need to understand the changes in order to play a part in planning sustainable food systems for tomorrow. The impact on analytical laboratories assessing the nutritional composition of foods produced and the effects that agricultural systems have on the nutritional quality of foods is forecast in this paper. It gives an outline of the needs, probable instrumentation that may be featured in laboratories in the next 10 years, and some of the problems envisaged.

AB The provision of sound agronomic advice based on soil and plant tissue analysis requires well-developed processes for information management and interpretation, operated by technically competent staff. Quality system principles commonly used in manufacturing and production systems (ISO 9000), have been successfully applied to an advisory service based on soil and plant analysis, including the process from sampling to analysis, interpretation and providing a recommendation, as well as the provision of training. Certification under ISO 9002 ensures agreed standards of customer service are established and adhered to, and provides a system for continuous improvement in all aspects of the service. The provision of agronomic advice through such systems supports the increasing trend amongst rural commodities towards externally certified management systems, to ensure the quality of outputs from sustainable production systems.

AB Soil quality is an increasingly useful and necessary concept in the design of sustainable farming systems, at paddock, farm and catchment levels. This paper reviews the concept of soil quality, and discusses its importance to the sustainability of agroecosystems. It is generally accepted that "soil quality" be measured by an appropriate suite of characteristics that includes chemical, physical and biological indicators that focus on the functions of soil in the ecosystem. Although there may be some merit in defining soil quality with the same rigour as is used to define water quality, and applying soil quality criteria in the same way as water quality criteria, it is likely that site and purpose specific criteria will be more useful at the farm level. Research continues to determine the optimum set of soil quality indicators that are sensitive to soil quality dynamics relevant to grazing systems in the Central Tablelands of N.S.W., and can be adopted and interpreted by farmers. One such project has commenced at Orange Agricultural College - The University of Sydney, and is described in detail. It is expected that this research will help provide farm managers with additional tools to assess the condition and trend of soil quality on their farms, and the impact of their decisions regarding farm design and management.

AB This article analyses the changing role of forests and the practices of peasants toward them in a Costa Rican rural community, drawing on an analytical perspective of political ecology, combined with cultural interpretations. The study underlines the complex articulation of local processes and global forces in tropical forest struggles. Deforestation is seen as a process of development and power involving multiple social actors, from politicians and development experts to a heterogeneous group of local peasants. The local people are not passive victims of global challenges, but are instead directly involved in the changes concerning their production systems and livelihood strategies. In the light of historical changes in natural resource utilization, the article underlines the multiplicity of the causes of tropical deforestation, and the intricate links between global discourses on environment and development and local forest relations.

AB The forms that cities take, the ways they function, and the mixes and distributions of activities within them have always been influenced very strongly by the capabilities of their underlying network infrastructures. Furthermore, cities have often been transformed by the introduction of new infrastructures. It is impossible to imagine Rotterdam without its canals and connection to the North Sea, Chicago without its railroads, Los Angeles without its freeways, or any large modem city without water supply, sewage, electrical, and telephone networks. Today, a new type of network infrastructure - high speed digital telecommunications - is being overlaid on cities everywhere. Its effects will be at least as revolutionary as those of the new network infrastructures of the past. it is already causing traditional building types and neighborhood patterns to fragment, recombine, and form startling new arrangements. This process will continue and accelerate. In this paper I describe the new digital infrastructure, analyze its major spatial effects, consider some illustrative examples of the resulting fragmentation and recombination, and discuss possible design responses with particular attention to social equity and long-term sustainability.

AB Digital City Bristol (DCB) aims to stimulate the provision of a sustainable and visually appealing Internet resource. Users of DCB can access public information about the city of Bristol, its organisations and its inhabitants. The web site is based around a graphical interface of piers in a harbour, each of which represents a different theme such as leisure, business, education or community groups. Initiated by Hewlett-Packard Laboratories, the project was developed with help of Bristol City Council, the University of the West of England (UWE), Bristol Evening Post and City NetGates Ltd. The pilot site was launched in March 1997.

AB Twelve surface (0-5 cm) sediment cores (10 cm diameter) were collected from each of two sites along a sewage-impacted wetland, one site above (pre-) and another site immediately downstream (post-) from the confluence where water from an adjacent natural wetland provides a sustainable input of phosphorus (P) reactants (iron and organic matter) to a sewage wetland. Triplicate sediment samples from pre- and post-confluence sites were sequentially extracted for non-occluded aluminium (Al) and iron (Fe)-P, carbonate-bound P, occluded Al/Fe-P and calcium (Ca)-bound P using: (i) sodium hydroxide (0.1 M NaOH), (ii) sodium chloride (1 M NaCl) and citrate-bicarbonate (CB), (iii) citrate-dithionite-bicarbonate (CDB), and (iv) hydrochloric acid (1 M HCl), respectively. The incorporation of recently-added phosphate to sediment inorganic P (P-i) and organic P (P-o) was investigated by adding carrier-free phosphate (P-32) to triplicate sediment suspensions which had been equilibrated under different pHs (pH of 5.5, 6.5 and 7.5) and added phosphate concentrations (0, 2.5 and 5 g P m(-3)). Sequential fractionation indicated that sediment P, was the major P form (79% total P) in the pre-confluence sediment, while sediment P-i was predominant (84% total P) in the post-confluence sediment receiving sustainable P reactants from a natural wetland water. The post-confluence sediment had a higher P-i (10-59-fold in all extracted fractions) and P-o content (5-6-fold higher in Ca-bound P and carbonate-bound P fractions) than the pre-confluence sediment. Both P-i and P-o in Ca-bound P accounted for less than 2% of total P in the pre- and post-confluence sediments. Carbonate-bound P and occluded Al/Fe-P represented minor P-i fractions in the pre-confluence sediment (10.3 and 4.6% of total P, respectively). In contrast, these fractions were the predominant P-i forms in the post-confluence sediment (49 and 28% of total P, respectively). Over 58% P-o in the pre- and post-confluence sediments was present as non-occluded Al/Fe-P and carbonate-bound P. The pre-confluence sediment contained 41% of sediment P-o in the occluded Al/Fe-P. In contrast, only 11% P-o in the post-confluence sediment was present in this occluded fraction. Over 80% of added P-32 was incorporated into the P-i of the pre- and post-confluence sediments, irrespective of pH and added phosphate concentrations. Most of P-32 (75-95%) incorporated into the sediment P-i pool was accounted for in the non-occluded Al/Fe-P and carbonate-P fractions of both pre- and post-confluence sediments. Over the pH range studied and added phosphate levels, the post-confluence sediment had a significantly (P less than or equal to 0.0001) higher P-32(i) activity in carbonate-bound and occluded Al/Fe-P-i fractions than the pre-confluence sediment.

ID CONSERVATION; MANAGEMENT; DYNAMICS
AB The case for marine reserves is strengthening, and both deterministic and stochastic calculations show that fisheries management using reserves may achieve harvests comparable with management without reserves. Thus, depending upon the metric used, reserves need not disadvantage harvest. Reserves provide a buffer that increases the chances of sustainability of the stock, and thus the fishery. In this paper, I develop methods (deterministic and stochastic) that allow one to determine how much habitat needs to be set aside as reserve, once societal decisions concerning the goals of reserves are made. The answer to the question: "how much habitat needs to be allocated to reserves" is not a simple single number. Rather, it is a procedure that can be employed once biological, operational and social information are provided. The methods also apply to reserves used to aid stock recovery.

TI Prudential regulation in Indian banking
SO ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL WEEKLY
LA English
DT Article
AB Prudential regulatory policy has been characterised by inserting best practices as defined by the Basle Accord into Indian banking. This approach has the weakness that it requires substantial reliance on supervision. Second the best practices were introduced without bank behavioural responses to them being well understood. Third, diversification as a means of making the banking system safer has not been explored. It is argued that the introduction of prudential regulation turned a credit liberal regime spawned by implicit government guarantees of bank safety and stability into a credit constrained regime. This regime is characterised by a reduction in lending and change in the composition of lending towards assets with a lower risk weighting such as government securities which is a temporary stock adjustment response by banks as they seek more sustainable balance sheet positions. Shifting from an emphasis on supervision towards more reliance on incentives to ensure safe and sound banking it is argued can be achieved by introducing contingent liability, structured supervision, and diversification.

AB The Yorkshire drought of 1995 was the most extreme climate event faced by the English and Welsh water industry since its privatization in 1989. As an emblem of crisis in privatized water management, and as a potential signal of climate change, the 1995 drought hits motivated change in water regulation and management. In this paper I challenge conventional interpretations of the 1995 water supply crisis as a natural hazard or as a result of managerial ineptitude. Drought is conceptualized as the production of scarcity, an outcome of three interrelated practices: meteorological modeling, demand forecasting, and corporate restructuring and the regulatory "game." These practices are situated within an analysis of the context of;he regulatory implications of the privatization of the water industry in 1989. I explore the simultaneously natural, social, and discursive elements of water scarcity and situate them within an analysis of privatization as regulation, rather than deregulation. This analysis brings insights developed in debates over "real" regulation and regulation theory to bear on nature-society analysis, while extending this debate through theorizing regulation as, in part, a discursive practice. The ensuing rereading of drought challenges conventional interpretations of environmental crisis, raises questions about the implications of water industry privatization, and emphasizes the need to account for the role of the state and the intricacies of "real" regulation in analyses of resource management.

AB Stress and fluid-pressure conditions for the initial formation within intact rock of faults (shear fractures), extension fractures, and extensional shears, and for the reshear of existing faults, may all be represented on a generic failure plot of differential stress (sigma(1) - sigma(3)) versus least effective compressive stress, sigma(3)' = (sigma(3) - P-f), scaled to nominal tensile strength, T ( half the cohesive strength). Plots of this kind may be used to define maximum sustainable overpressure in different tectonic environments and the structural conditions under which the flow of large fluid volumes may occur through-fault-fracture meshes containing gaping extension and extensional shear fractures. They may also be adapted to different tectonic regimes and correlated to depth for particular fluid-pressure conditions. High-flux flow through distributed fault-fracture meshes requires the tensile overpressure condition, sigma(3)' < 0, to be met (generally involving P-f > sigma(3)), which can only be achieved in the absence of throughgoing cohesionless faults that are well oriented for frictional reactivation in the prevailing stress field. High-flux flow through distributed fault-fracture meshes, intrinsically a transient, pulsing phenomenon, may therefore occur as follows: (1) in effectively intact low-pemeability crust devoid of throughgoing favorably oriented faults, (2) where existing faults have become severely misoriented in the prevailing stress field, and (3) where existing faults have regained cohesive strength through hydrothermal cementation.

SO ECONOMIC MODELLING

DT Article
DE potential output; technological advance; R & D; productivity
ID R-AND-D; GROWTH
AB This paper estimates a production function with endogenous technological advance, and incorporates it in a small econometric model to analyze its implications for long-term growth. The production function has constant returns to scale in labor and capital, and increasing returns to scale in all factors. Disembodied technological advance is measured primarily using the stock of research and development (R & D). Technology embodied in computers, or capital-augmenting technical advance, is implicitly taken into account through the hedonic price index. The efficiency of R & D improves over time, so that the elasticity for R & D in the production function is time-varying and increasing. The rate of increase is associated with computer quality, which is measured as a function of capacity and processing speed. In essence, there is a synergistic, multiplicative relationship between computer-based technology and R & D. Residual technical advance is a stochastic process, showing substantial variation over time. In the model, the stocks of both physical capital and R & D are determined by a neoclassical adjustment equation. The equilibrium stocks are a negative function of the user cost and a positive function of growth in demand. The projected rate of productivity growth is much higher than in calculations using deterministic technology. While extrapolations based on deterministic technology estimated the sustainable rate of productivity in the United States at roughly 1.1% per year in the late 1990s, this model yields a sustainable growth rate of over 1.9% per year. Potential output in the early 21st century is significantly higher than widely predicted. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Index based regional analysis: The case of the former Soviet Union and
   Russia
SO ECONOMICS OF PLANNING
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper presents a methodology for analysing inter-regional differences and identifying a suitable combination of policies for a set of regions. The methodology is based on the development of a composite index and is applied to compare (i) the members of the Former Soviet Union (FSU) and (ii) the regions of Russia. All variables considered and incorporated in the relevant index are (1) scaled from 0-100, so that the index is independent of units of measurement, and (2) weighted using survey results. According to the adapted regional development index Lithuania is on the top of the ranking followed by Latvia, Estonia, Ukraine, Belarus, Georgia, Russia, Armenia, Moldova, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan. The FSU countries are positioned on a regional development index - per capita income mapping to investigate whether emphasis should be placed on regional, environmental or sustainable development policies. Finally, an index that incorporates various socioeconomic components is computed for the regions of Russia which are subsequently classified based on the value of this index. This classification shows that the regions with the best index values are in the Central-Southern part of the country (with the exception of Sackha Republic, which is in the West). The regions with the lower index values are in the Western part of the country and in parts of Central Russia (Mariel republic, Moldovia Republic, Perm region).

AB An international consensus on the direction and goals of freshwater ecosystems management is emerging. This international consensus emphasises the importance of holistic approaches that define rights and responsibilities and that integrate the preservation of ecosystem functions as a central goal of water resources policies. Major international initiatives, such as the work of the Commission for Sustainable Development and the GEF Operational Strategy, provide an opportunity for articulating an integrated river basin management of water resources. The relationship between the developing international freshwater management regime and the Czech discourse on water in the landscape is here explored.

AB In 1999 the performance of the SR economy for the first time returned to the level achieved during the last pre-transformation year (1989). However, the pre-transformation level of employment was not mel: - in 1999 was 15 % less than 10 years ago. Structural parameters and the overall character of (non) sustainability of a noteworthy economic growth in 1994-1998 did not create any significant and long-lasting stimulus to boost employment. The mass economic and political change towards the necessary stabilization of both internal and external macro-economic imbalance has since 1999 till today deteriorated the difficult situation on the labour market and the rate of unemployment, at least from a short and long-term period.

This is a necessary condition for innovation on higher degrees, for the ability to absorb the outcomes of the world science and of a know-how into the domestic environment. The educational level determines also the level of adaptability of a society to quickly changing development conditions both on a domestic level and worldwide. It is an inevitable condition for sustainable economic growth and for a favourable employment development.

AB This paper outlines the evolution of an approach to building multimedia database applications for research and learning in an Australian university. This has involved an ongoing collaboration between the library, as database developer, together with research scholars and course managers, as application directors and discipline consultants. The paper provides details of three particular projects, the Australian Zooarchaeology image database. the fourteenth century music database and Audio Visual online. Each application has used the technological infrastructure provided by the library to develop unique and successful approaches to research and learning. All, in different ways, take advantage of the many new multimedia capabilities of the WWW and suggest that such an approach could be developed into a working model for building sustainable quality multimedia Web resources for research and learning.

AB The inclusion of sustainable land use policies and programs for emissions credit in the air quality planning process is examined. Reviewed first is the role of land use in procedures for development of the state implementation plan (SIP) and the transportation conformity determination. Twenty-seven metropolitan areas were surveyed to identify how land use currently is incorporated into air quality plans. The survey found nine metropolitan areas that include a control measure involving land use in an air quality plan, though only two of these actually quantify an emission reduction from the measure. Then three general policy options are examined that could allow for better accounting of the air quality benefits of sustainable land use. One option is to enhance transportation and land use forecasting procedures so that they better capture land use and design features. A second option is to adopt land use policies as an explicit SIP control measure. A third option Is to show an emissions reduction from land use as part of a transportation plan conformity determination. Existing rules are reviewed concerning each of these options, and how they would apply to land use measures is discussed.

AB The challenge of jointly addressing transportation and air quality concerns has been the subject of research for some time, but it reached its apex after passage of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 and the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991. Since that time, the legislative and regulatory context that prompted extensive research has been in continual flux, leading to ever-new areas even as the original agenda set in the early 1990s has yet to be completed. Critical relationships between transportation behavior and air quality impacts have yet to be clarified, and more data and better analytical tools will be necessary before greater understanding is achieved. The advent of new strategies related to telecommuting, e-commerce, vehicle insurance, car sharing, and "sustainability" poses serious questions for the research community. Concurrently, new challenges abound spawned from current and future developments. New air quality standards have redefined the meaning of "clean" air. Air toxics loom as the next focus area from the 1990 amendments. New vehicle and fuel standards are being adopted. Greenhouse gases and global warming pose particular challenges for transportation, but radically new vehicle-fuel systems for cars, trucks, and buses show promise that the transportation community can again rise to meet these challenges. Knowing where the greatest air quality problems exist and how best to address them is the stuff of cutting-edge research, which will pose a challenge into the next decade. It is an exciting time to be in transportation and air quality.

TI Environmental conflicts in compact cities: complexity, decisionmaking,
   and policy approaches
SO ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING B-PLANNING & DESIGN
LA English
DT Article
AB In most parts of Europe compact city policies have become a popular means of planning for sustainability. Dense compact cities were seen as solutions to reduce continually increasing mobility. They were also seen as a way to avoid urbanization of the countryside. Lately planners have been expressing serious doubts about the impact of these positive effects of the compact city concept. Planners in the Netherlands are instead shifting their attention more to environmental dilemmas which result, in part, from compact city policies. A number of these dilemmas are caused by frictions between environmentally sensitive and environmentally intrusive functions in a compact urban setting. Traditionally these dilemmas or conflicts were taken care of by using a functional rationality approach, that is one emphasizing direct causal relations between cause and effect. In the Netherlands this has resulted in a top-down policy, urging local authorities to keep enough distance between conflicting functions. Unfortunately the compact city concept adds an extra dimension to the problem, favouring mixed use and a dense urban area. Keeping distance can therefore no longer be the primary solution to environmental conflicts in urban areas. Environment conflicts have become, so to speak, more complex owing to spatial pressure and to a growing number of different interests that have to be taken into account. Functional rationality approaches may no longer be sufficient to solve these complex dilemmas or conflicts. Rather than keeping distance as the only possible solution to deal with conflicting functions, in the Netherlands local participation is also recognized as an effective approach towards some of the more complex conflicts. This communicative approach is gradually gaining acceptance in the Netherlands-and in other parts of the world as well-as a potential method for dealing with planning issues. In this paper functional and communicative rationality are seen as two extremes of the same spectrum, with complexity as the key word linking the two together. This has lead to the following thesis: the effectiveness and efficiency of a solution will depend on the assignment of the conflict's complexity. In this case, complexity is no longer seen as a metaphor, but instead as essential for examining planning issues, including environmental conflicts in compact cities.

AB Nonpoint source (NPS) pollution from widespread agricultural/pastoral land use in New Zealand can result in receiving water quality problems, but the Resource Management Act of 1991 requires the sustainable management of land and water resources. Many similar types of problems occur in the United States, where the Clean Water Act is the primary legislation addressing NPS pollution and progress has been made on the development and use of a variety of management approaches. However, little evaluation and comparison of approaches or cooperation between the two countries has occurred in the past. This type of analysis could provide information that is useful for more effective management of the problem. The goal of this study is to evaluate and compare approaches used in New Zealand and the United States for management of agricultural NPS pollution.
   The role of the central government in New Zealand is generally limited to research and policy development, and regional councils are responsible for most monitoring and management of the problem. The role of the federal government in the United States includes research and monitoring, policy development, and regulation. States also have a significant management role. Both countries rely on voluntary approaches for NPS pollution management. Very few national water quality standards exist in New Zealand, whereas standards are widely used in the United States. Loading estimates and modeling are often used in the United States. but not in New Zealand. A wide range of best management practices (BMPs) are used in the United States, including buffer strips and constructed/engineered wetlands. Buffer strips and riparian management have been emphasized and used widely in New Zealand.
   Many approaches are common to both countries, but management of the problem has only been partly successful. The primary barriers are the inadequacy of the voluntary approach and the lack of scientific tools that are useful to decision-makers. More work needs to be performed on the evaluation of approaches developed in both countries that could be applied in the other countries. In addition, more cooperation and information/technology transfer between the two countries should be encouraged in the future.

AB This paper assesses the extent to which key geomorphic components, processes, and stresses have been reflected in the management of a coastal sandy barrier environment. The management policies and practices of selected agencies responsible for Long Point, a World Biosphere Reserve along Lake Erie, Canada, were evaluated for consistency with these principles of environmental management for sandy barriers: maintaining natural stresses essential to sandy barrier development and maintenance; protecting sediment sources, transfers, and storage; recognizing spatial variability and cyclicity of natural stresses, such as barrier overwash events; and accepting and planning for long-term evolutionary changes in the sandy barrier environment. Generally, management policies and practices have not respected the dynamic and sensitive environment of Long Point because of limited mandates of the agencies involved, inconsistent policies, and failure to apply or enforce existing policies. This is particularly evident with local municipalities and less so for the Canadian Wildlife Service, the federal agency responsible for managing National Wildlife Areas at the point. In the developed areas of Long Point, landward sediment transfers and sediment storage in dunes Rave been impacted by cottage development, shore protection, and maintenance of roads and parking lots. Additionally, agencies responsible for managing Long Point have no jurisdiction over sediment sources as far as 95 km away. Evolutionary change of sandy barriers poses the greatest challenge to environmental managers.

ID INFECTION-CONTROL
AB While medical audit in infection control today is one important element in the quality assurance of health care, environmental auditing, approved in 1993 by the Council of the European Communities for the industrial sector, so far has not been used as a tool to control and reduce environmental pollution caused by medical care. The aim of this study was to investigate whether environmental auditing according to the European Eco-Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS) can be implemented in hospitals as a process of improvement in protection of the environment. In a prior publication the methodological issues and the organizational steps that had to be taken were described. An environmental review of the activities of the Freiburg University Hospital and an ecoanalysis of the input and output were performed. The results of this analysis, published in an environmental report, provide a fundamental data set for the consumption of energy, water, materials, and the burdens of major pollutants and waste. Regarding the organizational structure of the hospital, the first steps towards an integrating environmental management system as demanded by EMAS could be taken. Beside supporting advantages,e.g., improvement of environmental safety, public image and staff contentment, and potential economic benefits such as less cost to be paid for energy and water consumption, there are important restrictions of environmental auditing in hospitals. Examples are the lack of basic environmental data, staff motivation (especially of physicians), cooperation of the organizational substructures, and funds for prefinancing urgently needed improvements in ecology. Based on the study findings, a textbook on environmental auditing in hospitals, including checklists covering all important environmental objectives, has been published to support hospitals in their efforts to achieve an optimized and sustainable practice of providing health care.

AB The steep slopes, high rainfall and intensive cultivation have led to soil erosion in the coffee-based, land use areas of Embu District, Kenya, The farmers face shortages of fodder for livestock, lack of fuelwood, and limited incomes. These problems could be resolved by introducing napier grass strips, or agroforestry in the form of alley cropping with calliandra hedges. The objective of the study is therefore to compare the sustainability and profitability of napier grass strips, calliandra hedges, and soil-and-nutrient replacement, against the traditional agriculture. Biophysical simulation, to assess the sustainability of the four farming systems, was undertaken using the Soil Changes Under Agroforestry (SCUAF) model. The economic efficiency and risk of the four systems was assessed with the @Risk model. The calliandra system proved the most sustainable and the traditional system the least, although the calliandra system is not truly sustainable. But it is the most profitable and so it seems the most appropriate system to meet the farmers' expectations of increased and sustained production. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Environmental problems include eutrophication of rivers and storages, elevated salinity levels, widespread blooms of toxic blue-green algae, decline of native fish and bird populations, and reduction of area of riverine wetlands. Both the community and the government are committed to improving the state of the environment in the Basin, both for it's intrinsic ecological values, and to ensure the sustainability of production in what is Australia's most economically important agricultural region. To facilitate the on-going trade-off process between competing users of this resource, a decision support system (DSS) is being developed which will enable explicit prediction of the Likely response of key features of the riverine environment to proposed flow management scenarios. The DSS is being developed using the RAISON shell (Lam, D.C.L., Mayfield, C.I., Swayne, D.A., Hopkins, K., 1994. A prototype information system for watershed management and planning. Journal of Biological Systems 2 (4), 499-517), and will integrate a range of simple models of riverine ecology which are being developed. These models will include qualitative and quantitative models representing the response of different aspects of the instream and floodplain ecology dependent upon the river flow regime. The DSS will not include a detailed model of river hydrology or hydraulics, but rather, will use the output from the range of such models currently in use in the Basin as inputs to the ecological models. The DSS will also provide a range of tools to allow user-defined evaluation of scenario results, as well as explanations and supporting information to elucidate the ecological modelling.

AB Few agricultural producers utilize the true analytical power of GIS and computer simulation models, partly because the loose linkages developed to-date between GIS and most public-domain modeling software are extremely cumbersome to use. The integrated system (EPIC-View) developed in the study allows the integration of a comprehensive hydrologic-crop management model (EPIC) with a desktop GIS to function as a planning tool aimed at implementing sustainable farm management practices. The use of GIS makes possible the integration of diverse spatial data into a comprehensive spatial database. EPIC-View is applied to simulate nitrogen (N) dynamics under conventional and minimum tillage conditions of a field located in Caddo County, Oklahoma. In general, the overall N balance obtained under minimum tillage is better than the balance obtained under conventional tillage over a 5-year model run. Unexplained losses of N averaged 9.55% and 4.2% of the gain in N under conventional and minimum tillage respectively. The integrated modeling system holds immense potential as a farm management tool. Various components of a sustainable agricultural system including irrigation management, crop management, soil management, and pest management, can be efficiently managed. This approach could make farms more economically viable and ecologically sound. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Peoples and communities, especially indigenous communities, are forced to deal with an increasingly complex set of environmental, social, cultural, and economic problems related to pollution. It is important to use evaluation tools that reflect the values and perspectives of the affected peoples, and which can evaluate risks and impacts to the natural resource base upon which we all depend. Evaluation tools, such as risk assessment, are being applied to spatio-temporal systems and lifestyles for which they were not designed, so new integrating tools are needed to bridge the gap between narrow sets of endpoints and western perspectives, on the one hand, and a much broader set of endpoints and more holistic indigenous perspectives on the other hand. The perspectives and even the necessity to account for traditional Native American lifestyles have gone unnoticed in classical environmental planning and risk assessment methods. If tribal rights and resources are affected, one way to ensure that those tools reflect the appropriate values is to redesign the risk tools using traditional environmental management principles. For example, Native American communities are inseparable from their lands and resources, so evaluation of their risks from contamination must integrate human physiological and mental health, ecological health, socio-economic health, and cultural and spiritual health within a single framework. This does not mean simply adding a quality-of-life component and calling it cultural risk, or using an exposure scenario that reflects additional routes of exposures. Rather, it means beginning the assessment by understanding the entire eco-cultural system (people and biota interlocked in a co-adapted system of behaviors and ecologies that is sustainable over time but which is now severely strained even without the addition of contamination). This paper provides some suggestions for improving risk assessment through the use of dependency webs that are drawn to represent the entire eco-cultural system that is at risk, and therefore that identify more consequences of environmental contamination. Dependency webs help identify the resources, uses, functions, and services associated with a resource or area that is at risk from contamination. They also help to structure the analysis so that all the elements important to the affected community are included in the risk assessment and not deferred to the risk management phase or omitted altogether. Finally, the ethics of risk assessments (their use and misuse) will be improved as information becomes more complete and transparent.

AB Risk assessment at the regional level requires quality resource information on critical factors for sustainable land-use decisions. This paper describes a major community initiative underway in the Southland Region of New Zealand involving geographic information systems mapping of 850,000 ha at a 1:50,000 scale. At a southerly latitude of 46 degrees in the southern part of the South Island of New Zealand, the critical factors affecting plant growth are soil quality and air temperature. Air temperature is being measured with a network of 900 automatic data loggers positioned to represent key features of the landscape and recording maximum and minimum temperatures every hour for a full year. Data are then differentially adjusted using the nearest long-term weather station to the site to generate a 30-year normal temperature record and consequent growing-degree-day value for each site. Isocontour maps are then generated to identify microclimates of interest within the landscape. Soils of the area are being mapped at the same time and to the same scale to allow integrated development of the critical information for sustainable land-use decisions. Basic soil attributes will be interpreted to produce maps for crop suitability, vulnerability to structural degradation, and leaching risk. High-class soils will also be identified. An Internet site and a bureau service will be established. This will provide technical support and interpretation of the data for clients to encourage wide use of the information produced by the project. The project is being supported and funded by the local community in the belief that the provision of high-quality resource information will lead to significant employment opportunities in the region.

AB In virtually every major environmental act, Congress has required that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) ensure not only that the air be safe to breathe, the water safe to drink, and the food supply free of contamination, but also that the environment be protected. In response, the U.S. EPA's Office of Research and Development (ORD) has established research to improve ecosystem risk assessment and management, identifying it as one of the highest priority research areas for investment over the next 10 years. The research is intended to provide environmental managers with new tools and flexible guidance that reflect a holistic environmental management perspective of science and that can be applied both to common and unique problems. In keeping with its responsibility to provide the U.S. EPA with science that supports a dynamic changing regulatory agenda, the ORD has set the goal of its Ecological Research Program to "provide the scientific understanding required to measure, model, maintain and/or restore, at multiple scales, the integrity and sustainability of ecosystems now, and in the future." In the context of this program, ecological integrity is defined in relative terms as the maintenance of ecosystem structure and function characteristic of a reference condition deemed appropriate for its use by society, and sustainability is defined as the ability of an ecosystem to maintain relative ecological integrity into the future. Therefore, the research program will emphasize relative risk and consider the impact of multiple stressors, at multiple scales and at multiple levels of biological organization. The program will also shift from chemical to biological and physical stressors to a far greater extent than in the past. The purpose of this paper is to provide an introduction to the U.S. EPA's changing ecological research program.

AB Estuarine mud, when resuspended in nutrient-rich near-shore water, aggregates to marine snow, and within minutes to hours can exert detrimental or even lethal effects on small coral reef organisms. In a pilot study, estuarine mud was suspended in near-shore and off-shore waters of the Great Barrier Reef to a final concentration of 170 mg 1(-1). The short-term responses of a coral (Acropora sp.) and coral-inhabiting barnacles (subfamily Pyrgomatidae), exposed to either near-shore or off-shore water, were microscopically observed and video recorded. In the off-shore water treatment, flocculation was minor, and aggregate sizes were c. 50 mu m. The organisms were able to clean themselves from these small settling aggregates at low siltation (<0.5 mg cm(-2)), and struggled and produced mucus only at high siltation (4-5 mg cm (-2)). In contrast, in near-shore, nutrient-enriched waters, the suspended mud aggregated into large sticky flocs of marine snow (200-2000 ym diameter). The organisms responded to a thin coat of deposited flocs with vigorous cleaning by cirri and tentacle beating. After 5 min struggle, the barnacle stopped moving, calanoid copepods were entangled in the aggregates, and thick layers of mucus were exuded by the coral polyps. Both barnacle and copepods died after < 1 h exposure; a short time compared with natural occurrences of marine snow deposition on coral reefs. Enhanced nutrient concentrations are known to contribute to enhance biologically mediated flocculation. This pilot study suggests that the concentration of suspended mud, and extent of stickiness and flocculation, can synergistically affect reef benthos organisms after short exposure. The enclosed macro video recordings clearly visualize these effects, and help convey the important implications for managers: that inshore reefs of the Great Barrier Reef cannot be sustainably managed without managing the adjacent land.

TI Fiscal risks are not only in the budget
SO FINANCE A UVER
LA Czech
DT Article
AB The article demonstrates the importance of incorporating contingent liabilities into fiscal analysis. When explicit expenditures are shifted off budget or replaced by guarantees, achieved fiscal balance is an illusion. In the Czech Republic, fiscal adjustment may have been overstated by some three to four percent of annual GDP during the 1990's. A stabilization program accompanied by a build-up of contingent liabilities, particularly, state guarantees and obligations to cover liabilities emerging from directed credit and from the purchases of bad assets by state-sponsored agencies, may not be sustainable. The study concludes that the government of the Czech Republic should aim at reducing its overall fiscal vulnerability rather than the budget deficit, develop a more effective strategy to resolve the problem of hidden debt, and enhance the public-finance institutional framework to create adequate incentives for policy makers in dealing with contingent liabilities.

DT Article
DE transition; formal and informal rules; macroeconomic policy
AB The transition from a planned to a market economy can be rather neatly divided into two periods - the revolutionary period (privatisation, liberalisation, and stabilisation) and the evolutionary period (implementation of institutional framework). In this regard, the Slovak experience shows that while short-term growth is relatively easy to achieve, the challenge remains sustainable long-term growth. Revolution period is necessary toward effecting economic transition, but is no end in itself. The transition of a national economy is not limited to economics; it has a political and social dimension as well, which are particularly evident in the Slovak context with regard to privatisation, economic policy, and the realisation of pro-reform legislation. Human capital is essential not only for the restructuring of firms but also for the reform of public administration and toward the greater creation of an efficient market economy framework.

DE Czech Republic; competitiveness; optimum currency areas; real exchange
   rate; transition
AB The authors consider the current exchange-rate regime in the Czech Republic as the Czech economy prepares for entry into the EU and the EMU. The macroeconomic impacts of a single-currency regime are classified according to traditional OCA theory. Using quantitative measures, the authors find the degree of macroeconomic convergence between the Czech and German (EU) economies sufficient enough to preclude major obstacles to the implementation of a fixed-currency regime in the Czech Republic. Also examined are the transitional specifics of the Czech economy. The paper analyzes the real appreciation of the Czech currency and its competitiveness and finds that the development of cost factors exert depreciationary pressures on the exchange rate. Conversely, a fixed regime might alleviate problems related to the influx foreign capital and consequent nominal appreciation-an idiosyncrasy of the Czech economy. However, once labor market rigidities are removed, a fixed regime offers the Czech economy a basis of sustainable competitive advantage, growth, and convergence to the EU.

DE Parapenaeus longirostris; shrimp; selectivity; Gulf of Cadiz; SW Spain
AB The deep-water rose shrimp (Parapenaeus longirostris, Lucas, 1846) is a typical shrimp which is one of the main target species in the demersal fishery in the Spanish south Atlantic region. In this paper, the selectivity parameters of this species have been studied in two different selectivity survey designs (research vessels and in commercial fishing vessels). We have found 2 mm difference between both methods in the 50% retention length (L-50) The selection factors obtained from the oceanographic vessels range from 0.37 to 0.49, while those from the commercial vessels are lower, from 0.32 to 0.39. The effects of mesh size changes in the present exploitation pattern are also considered. The present exploitation pattern is far from to optimal due to an overexploitation of the smaller sizes. The different simulations of changes in mesh size do not show great differences in maximum sustainable yields, but important market variations occur above 30% and 50% over the present obtained values. In reference to the immediate effects which could produce an increase of the mesh size, losses of 36%, 51% and 62% for the referred mesh sizes (50, 55 and 60) using the selectivity parameters obtained from the surveys of research vessels are estimated. If obtained from the surveys of the commercial vessels, these values correspond, respectively, to 27%, 42% and 73%. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The world has become an increasingly uncertain place to do business. As information technology develops, markets move more rapidly and the uncertainty increases. At the same time there are greater opportunities than ever before. Successful strategies for sustainable business growth must be underpinned by the intersection of commerce, science and technology. Consumers are better informed and have greater choices than ever before. There is an increasing demand for higher added value and product performance creating new challenges for the design of food products. Commitment to research in scientific disciplines is key to successful innovation in the food industry. It is scientific innovation that allows us to grow the industry by improving product performance, costs, quality, safety and environmental practice. Successful companies will be those who can establish mutually beneficial relationships with their suppliers which exploit technology and scientific achievement in a way which better meets the needs of their consumers.

One of the main objectives of the newly reformed forest and conservation legislation is the adoption of a two-track approach - establishment of a sufficient network of nature conservation areas and an ecologically sustainable forestry. Priorities for ecological and socio-economic research in this context are suggested in the paper. The need for a proper valuation of non-wood benefits of forests is particularly emphasized.

AB Spain's experience in nature protection is analysed from the perspective of the implementation of a new EU-wide nature protection network: Natura 2000. Natura 2000 aims at a harmonized nature protection policy at the European level. It opens the opportunity for a review of the existing protection policies. Due to its wide range of climates, Spain will be the leading country in the Natura 2000 protected area. Following the holistic approach of sustainability - environmental, economic and social - as defined in UNCED (Rio de Janeiro (1992), Helsinki (1993) and Lisbon (1998)) special attention is given to the distribution of the costs and benefits of the protected-areas policy. Several socio-economic proposals for an improved protected-areas policy are developed.

Approaches to travel time estimation traditionally have been based on aggregate data sets that examine travel times over a number of days or travel times in previous time intervals. Automatic vehicle identification data make it possible to analyze travel time data at a totally disaggregate or individual commuter level. It is postulated in this research that the capability of modeling travel characteristics on a disaggregate level can improve the accuracy with which performance measures are quantified. The test beds examined are a 22-km section of the I-10 corridor and a 21-km section of the US-290 corridor in Houston, Texas. It was found that aggregation across days, which does not consider the effect of individual days, is 63 percent less accurate than aggregation by days, which does consider the effect of individual days. Even though the latter technique was found to be more accurate, it was illustrated that 40 percent of the regular commuters' travel times are statistically different from these aggregate estimates. Similarly, for travel time variability, it was found that for approximately 20 percent of the cases the travel time standard deviations for regular commuters are statistically different from the aggregate estimates. These results illustrate the uniqueness of an individual commuter's travel patterns and emphasize the benefit of conducting analyses at the level of the individual commuter for both ATIS and sustainable transportation.

AB China's agricultural sector requires reforms to assure farmers and consumers of fair prices while protecting the environment and permitting sustainable growth in the coming years. The affluent eastern province of Jiangsu is an appropriate site in which to explore the effects of agricultural reforms on rural households and, in turn, the effects of these households on the environment. We compare two surveys (1987 and 1996), of too households each, of farmers in Huaiyin and Huai'an Counties, Jiangsu Province. Indicated are chronically low economic returns on grain, moderate returns for livestock, and the highest returns for vegetables. Unfortunately, the production of livestock and vegetables requires more farm chemicals, inorganic fertilizers, and placement of field plastic-all of which are associated with greater environmental problems.

TI Quality tourism - a sustainable alternative to the development of
   tourism on Mallorca?
SO GEOGRAPHISCHE ZEITSCHRIFT
LA German
DT Article
AB The main concern of this paper is to show whether or not the so-called quality tourism initiative which has recently been launched on Mallorca and which is intended as an alternative to mass tourism, does in fact represent a sustainable form of tourism on the island as promised by the former balearic government. The four branches of "quality tourism", i.e. golf, nautic, residential and agro-tourism are described and their economic dynamism and advantages as well as their - partly disastrous - ecological consequences are identified.
   In sum, with the exception of agro-tourism, the so-called quality tourism is not a sustainable alternative to mass tourism. In contrast to official statements the term ,,quality" until now does not refer to the inclusion of concerns towards nature and landscape conservation in tourism planning but obviously only to the prestige and the financial power associated with this farm of tourism. In effect golf tourism, nautic tourism and residential tourism in the way they are practised all lead to a continued, very aggressive consumption of landscape and resources - and this very often in parts of the island which had not been involved in touristic development before. An inquiry carried out by the author amongst the local population of Mallorca shows that many of the Mallorcans are against golf tourism (rejected by 67%) and nautic tourism (rejected by 44%) because of the visible and well known destroying effects on the environment of the latter.

TI Health reform for children: the Egyptian experience with school health
   insurance
SO HEALTH POLICY
LA English
DT Article
DE children; insurance; policy process; sustainability
AB In June 1992, the People's Assembly of Egypt passed Law 99 expanding health insurance to cover all school children. This was one of the most important initiatives undertaken in recent years by the Ministry of Health, and it effectively increased the number of beneficiaries covered by the Health Insurance Organization (HIO) from 3.75 million in 1988 to about 14 million in 1993. This paper first examines the policy processes for the introduction of this innovation in Egypt's health system. Next, the paper discusses the implementation and consequences of the new policy in terms of coverage, financing, benefits, and delivery of services, along with data on utilization and expenditures. Several important lessons derive from this analysis. First, major reform efforts are possible when there is a strong political commitment and the proposed program and solutions are acceptable to the key stakeholders. Second, compromises and trade-offs are essential to construct a politically feasible and ethically acceptable reform initiative. Third, while these trade-offs might yield short-term gains, the trade-offs in the long term may undermine the reform's capacity to achieve the anticipated equity enhancements and can potentially undermine the financial sustainability of the reform.

AB Many strategies have been proposed for delaying the development of insect resistance to Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt). The current paradigm for Bt resistance management is the high dose-refuge strategy. For this strategy to be successful: (i) heterozygotes must be killed in treated areas, (ii) resistant alleles must be rare (frequency < 10-3), and (iii) there must be a high level of gene flow between populations to ensure random mating. We studied gene flow within and between populations with a view to managing the resistance of Chrysomela tremulae (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) to new transgenic, highly toxic poplars expressing a synthetic Br gene. In this study, we assessed the extent of gene flow in C. tremulae within and between 16 sites in France and Belgium, using allozyme markers. We found a high level of genetic variability in C, tremulae, with a mean of 0.206<plus/minus>0.16. There were no obvious limitations to gene flow between populations of C. tremulae over large geographical distances (several hundreds of kilometres). Nevertheless, a very low level of genetic differentiation was observed between a site located in the south of France and the sampled sites from the Centre region.

AB A new application was implemented to help reduce total vehicle trips and vehicle miles of travel (VMT) by means of encouraging use of trip chaining and substitution for all types of trips. Travel diaries were provided to employees of a local YMCA for measurement of travel behavior before and after provision of customized travel suggestions. An analysis of covariance was conducted on the average contributed VMT and contributed vehicle trips, with the use of the second period results as the dependent variable. The provision of suggestions had a statistically significant effect on vehicle miles and trips contributed. Overall, it was shown that the provision of travel information would reduce VMT. Further research should be conducted in order to indicate the extent to which such information must be customized. Further research should also be conducted on the durability and sustainability of the impacts of the information.

AB The history of water management in China is a long way to remedy, the inhomogeneous repartition of water in the country. Since about ten years the rapid growth of economy and urbanization has sent a new challenge concerning the water management. The soil erosion worsening and the natural reservoirs exploiting have increased the necessity of the battle against the floods. In the towns, the water demand growth is exceeding the capacity, increase of drinking water plants. In much areas of the country the water pollution is a crucial problem Moreover the investment and the water management reform has an influence on the economic global development. The global objective of China is to reach the average standard Of living of the industrialized countries. Nowadays the water problems in China are : the floods in the South, the water shortage in the North and the pollution. These problems are considered as an obstacle to sustainable development. It is therefore necessary to take measures in oi-der to guarantee a sufficient water supplying.

   lifestyle; image; social exclusion
ID CONSUMPTION; CHILDREN
AB Debates about the significance of housing tenure are well established within housing studies, but have tended to rely heavily upon economic and political dimensions of consumption. Hitherto, the perceptions of young people have been politically, if not economically, ignored. This article makes a contribution to the housing tenure debate that stresses the cultural dimension of consumption. In particular, it uses Bourdieu's idea of "habitus" and Bauman's notion of "the flawed consumer" to provide a new perspective on the debate. Drawing on data from qualitative interviews with a small sample of young people, the article considers young peoples' perceptions of housing tenure. It assesses how their tenure prejudice - positive images of home ownership and negative images of council housing - are the product of a housing socialization process and considers the ways in which prevailing attitudes towards housing tenure have been transmitted to a future generation of housing consumers. It uses the work of Bourdieu to consider how and why such socialization has taken place and Bauman's work on consumption to analyse these trends. Finally, the article considers the theoretical implications and policy relevance of the results presented, considering the need for housing education amongst UK school children and the sustainability of some plans for an urban renaissance.

DT Article
AB Based on many years of experience in the monitoring and evaluation of health and related projects in Nigeria, this article emphasises the need for a new approach, giving much greater responsibility to community-based organisations and allowing them a major role in consequent modifications to project design. It is suggested that this could greatly assist in fostering project ownership and hence the potential for sustainability. Emphasising the accountability of the project to the intended beneficiaries in this manner would also encourage those beneficiaries collectively to ensure financial accountability with regard to the use of donor and local project funds. Provision of training and support to enable community-based organisations to undertake these new responsibilities could also have substantial multiplier effects on the local economy, as new skills, for example management of microcredit schemes for health costs, were applied in other sectors.

AB The community is the ultimate barometer of success or failure of an intervention. Involvement of community members in health care programmes, decision-making. evaluation and implementation is a major means for achieving the necessary fit between the programme and its beneficiaries. The World Bank-Funded Family Health Project was launched in Sindh Province of Pakistan, in 1992. It aims to strengthen the existing health system and improve the health status of the population. To achieve sustainable results, FHP focused on engaging community participation. Village Health Committers were formed at Basic Health Unit and Rural Health Centre levels under an Area Focus Approach. Village Health Committee members were trained to understand the basic concept of FHP. be able to identify factors which affect the health of the community, and suggest local methods for combating these problems, Thr Village Health Committer's main objective was to ensure community participation, improve utilisation of outreach health services, improve accountability of the service providers through community involvement, and decentralization of power at the community level. This article reflects on the experience of the FHP in implementing these objectives.

SO IDS BULLETIN-INSTITUTE OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
AB Participation has been encouraged for many years in health development work, as a means to involve populations in improving the appropriateness and quality of their local health services. This article is an attempt to highlight a new approach to participation which moves away from a purely community focused activity and seeks to engage a broader partnership between health service providers, managers and users for a more accountable and sustainable end product. It takes inspiration from the Client Oriented Provider Efficient process (COPE) which has been proved an effective tool to improve the qualify of reproductive health services. Mixing some of its core components with Participatory Learning and Action (PLA) methods we have developed a new model of participatory planning and training. Preliminary results show that including all stakeholders in the process can work as long as the exercises are accessible to all. This accessibility is achieved through a range of visualisation methods. As with any tool for Human Resource Development the crucial issue continues to be the need for effective follow up which can maintain levels of enthusiasm and quality in resource-poor settings.

AB High spectral(10 nm) and radiometric (16 bits) resolutions of IRS-P3:MOS-B coupled with moderate spatial resolution (188 m) of IRS-P3:WiFS provide unique solutions to many problems related to sustainable management of ecosystems. While the high spatial resolutions of IRS-1C PAN and IRS-1C LISS-3 help in identifying the structural attributes of the biosphere, a synthetic product of MOS-B and WiFS offers immense potential to address several crucial issues including improved classification accuracy in heterogeneous land covers, environmental stress, improved vegetation signal-to-noise ratio, etc, In this paper, the operational issues such as multisensor calibration and validation, registration and merging of multisensor data from different platforms, identification of red edge using IRS-P3:MOS-B data, resolving subpixel heterogeneity, scale anomalies and uncertainty in spectral estimates of biophysical variables are discussed, With the integration of parameters sensitive to atmospheric scattering and soil background reflectance into NDVI derived from the synthetic image, the spectral index called soil adjusted and atmospheric resistant vegetation index (SARVI) has been found to be more sensitive to biophysical variables such as leaf area index (LAI) and fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR), It has also reduced, up to certain extent, the uncertainty related to the spectral measurements of bio-physical variables, Further study, in this regard, aims at evaluating the changes in entropy with the fusion of high spectral, radiometric, spatial, and temporal data.

   sustainability
SO INTERNASJONAL POLITIKK
LA Norwegian
DT Article
AB The breakdown of negotiations on a 'Millennium round' in the WTO has left the world trade organisation on a sidetrack. The breakdown, which did not come unexpectedly, was caused by a combination of political, institutional and cognitive-ideational factors. While WTO's purpose remains to enhance market liberalisation under a non-discrimination regime (efficacy goal), it is in need of renewed legitimacy and also greater organisational efficacy. A contradiction has emerged between the formal (consensus, one nation-one vote) and informal (great power dominance) structures that undermines its legitimacy in the eyes of in particular many developing countries and civil society. While the WTO will have to live with such a dualistic decision-making system, a new balance between the two structures will have to be struck. Also the tendency to force new items on to its agenda and speed up liberalisation has turned out to be counterproductive. At the same time, the capacity of the organisation to handle the agenda is far from sufficient. One solution which may reduce this problem and at the same time could offer greater legitimacy is to 'out-source' several pre-negotiation tasks to other institutions, mainly UNCTAD, UNEP and other UN bodies, and consider seriously to leave work on social clauses to the ILO.

ID RURAL INDIA; ENERGY; OPTIMIZATION
AB In this paper, we present a goal programming model for block level energy planning in order to make a block self-sufficient in electricity consumption, which includes the commercial energy consumption goal, the goal of generating electricity from biomass and food production goals with linear constraints on the available sources such as human power, animal power, tractor power, land area and on the requirement of the block such as cooking energy, lighting energy and energy for other operations, such as fodder for animal population. We try to achieve these goals through proper allocation of land for different crops. After reformulating the developed goal programming model into a linear programming format, we use the HYPER LINDO software package to solve it in a Pentium-based IBM-PC compatible computer system. The developed model is solved for a typical Indian block, namely Nilakkottai Block in Tamil Nadu, India. The model solution shows that the goal of generating electricity from biomass is achieved, the commercial energy consumption goal and pulses requirement goal are under-achieved and the sugar requirement goal is over-achieved. Furthermore, the cereal, vegetable and oilseed production goals are achieved. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI The sustainability of welfare states into the twenty-first century
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH SERVICES

DT Article
AB Few would deny that the advanced welfare state faces a set of severe challenges. There is less agreement on what the challenges are and how important they are. The three most cited sources of crisis are population aging, family instability,, and the labor market consequences of globalization and technological change. It is, however, questionable whether these affect the three dominant types of welfare systems similarly. The past decade bears witness to numerous attempts at reform and readaptation but such efforts have, so far, perpetuated or even strengthened underlying disequilibria. The result is mounting diswelfare, especially among younger households. The author examines various reform strategies (privatization, decentralization, and familialization) and concludes that these imply suboptimality. A "win-win" policy can be identified to the extent that it simultaneously maximizes fertility and women's employment and minimizes poverty risks. Greater earnings and income inequalities probably cannot be escaped, but their impact can be neutralized through a shift toward guaranteed life chances through education and skills.

DE unemployment; human capital theory; public sector
AB The Australian unemployment rate has fallen to its lowest level since 1989, and looks likely to fall further, perhaps even reaching the rate of 5 per cent, widely regarded as "full employment". However, this relatively favourable outcome has been achieved only after a cyclical expansion so long and robust that it has been widely regarded as "miraculous". It is important therefore, to consider whether recent reductions in unemployment will be maintained when the current expansion ends, and whether alternative policies could produce stronger and more sustainable growth in employment.

AB Assurance, a British warship of 44 guns, was lost on the Needles of Wight, UK, in 1753. Pomone, a British 5th rate 38-gun frigate of the Leda class, followed in 1811. Designated a 'protected wreck' in 1975 this multi-period site was investigated under a UK Government licence. Despite her total disintegration. Pomone left artefact scatters attesting to her size, character, resting position and evidence of her cabin plan. This archaeological evidence is compared with two surviving sister ships, and the presumption of imcomprehensible 'scrambling' on Muckelroy Class 5 wreck sites is robustly challenged. The licencee reviews the organization and methodology of 25 years of licenced activity on this site and concludes that the UK policy of promoting invasive investigation of historic shipwrecks cannot be readily reconciled with the principles of sustainability which are now embodied in European Agenda 21.

ID PARADIGM
AB Today, "lean" may no longer be fashionable but its core principles (flow, value, Pull, minimizing waste etc.) have become the paradigm for many manufacturing (and service) operations. Given this pre-eminence, the paper seeks to establish what impact if has had on the overall competitive positions of adopter firms. Combining normative and critical theory (from lean production and resource-based view of the firm literature) with empirical material drawn from three case studies, the paper argues that lean production can underpin competitive advantage if the firm is able to appropriate the productivity savings if creates. Similarly, the ambiguity of lean production in practice scans that the implementation process can create strategic resources to underpin? sustainable competitive advantage. Problematically, however, the paper also suggests that being "lean" can curtail the firm's ability to achieve long-term flexibility. It concludes with suggestions for further work.

DE bait shyness; sodium monofluoroacetate (1080); brushtail possum;
   Trichosurus vulpecula; vertebrate pest control
AB Bait shyness is a significant threat to the sustainable control of vertebrate pests. New Zealand's foremost vertebrate pest is the introduced brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula). Bait shyness was identified in two wild possum populations by comparing the consumption of two non-toxic bait types before and after each population was presented with one of the bait types containing the toxin sodium monofluoroacetate (1080). Before poisoning, approximately 60% of total bait consumption was of the type which 1080 was later presented in, whereas after poisoning this bait type made up only 2-4% of total consumption. This shyness persisted for at least 11 weeks in one of the populations. No individual component (bait base, cinnamon lure or green dye) of the toxic bait could be isolated as the primary cue eliciting bait shyness as the response. Possible means of overcoming bait shyness are discussed in light of these findings.

AB Service profit chain is a well-received model to explain the sustainable competitiveness of many service organizations The model attributes a service organization's financial and market performance to its relationships with its customers and employees. According to the service profit chain, internal service quality serves the foundation of the model and it ignites a chain effect leading to an organization's growth and profitability in the end The purpose of this study is to provide an ad hoc analysis of two hey elements of the service profit chain. Specifically, this research explores the direct linkage between performance in growth and profitability and quality of work life, which is a proxy for internal service quality in the service profit chain model, The performance of companies with a reputation of high quality of work life weve contrasted to a control group of S&P 500 companies using COMPUSTAT data.

AB Knowledge is the most meaningful resource today. The management of knowledge supports the competitive advantage of organizations. A survey conducted by Computer Science Corporation (CSC) found that senior IS executives perceive knowledge management to be among the most critical technologies that will drive business growth and innovation by the year 2000 ii]. It is widely claimed by a number of businesses and academic professionals that in order for the organization to have a lasting competitive advantage it will have to be knowledge driven [2]. Robert Hiebeler [3, p.24] writes, "Those companies that develop best practices for managing knowledge capital will be the ones that ride this competitive wave". Drucker [4, ch.1] stated in his book Post Capitalist Society, "The basic economic resource is no longer capital, nor natural resources. It is and will be knowledge". Ultimately, the knowledge that is most relevant is that required for the performance of critical organization processes.
   One of the barriers to sharing knowledge, like data or information, across industries is finding a common language that promotes dialogue and exchange. Regardless of the industry or market, a common taxonomy allows one to commonly refer to the same type of work by the same name. This practice within knowledge management (KM) should accelerate the process of organizational learning. This article presents a model that can serve as a process framework of KM in the organization. Each process discussed in this article includes work ('processes') that may be performed by organizations that deliberately manage knowledge. The present lack of effective management of knowledge could be because most organizations are still struggling to comprehend the KM concept [2].
   This KM process provides a foundation for an organization to understand its knowledge resources and activities. Corporations around the world have identified the need for KM; however, they have not identified a taxonomy of processes or a vocabulary to communicate these processes. This paper addresses these two needs by providing a procedural method for creating a sustainable KM system.

AB Researchers in the areas of sustainable competitive advantage have come to the conclusion that the only thing that gives an organization a competitive edge - the only thing that is sustainable - is what it knows, how it uses what it knows, and how fast it can know something new. Bur if most agree on the key role of knowledge as a source of competitive advantage, very few know how to manage knowledge that produces value or Intellectual Capital in an efficient way. ICES is trying to fill this gap using benchmarking techniques, and facilitating the process of learning from the best competitors.
   ICES, which stands for Intellectual Capital Benchmarking System, is at the same time a new management method and a new management tool that allows companies to benchmark core competencies or intellectual capital against the best world-class competitors of the same business activity. The system is a framework built around the key competitiveness factors and criteria that determine competitiveness in the context of global markets.
   The main factors considered are products, architecture, alliances, competitive advantages, innovation and R&D, leadership, strategy and culture. ICES identifies the specific competitiveness factors and criteria which are relevant in a given business activity. The system through the competitiveness factors framework, enables the identification, audit and benchmark of the core competencies or key intellectual capital, that are the main sources of sustainable competitive advantages. When using ICES in an orderly systematic and repetitive way we obtain competitiveness Balance Sheets, that complement and perfect financial balance sheets and lead companies to leveraging intellectual capital. The system has been tested and successfully implemented in more than thirty European enterprises.

AB This paper addresses the need for sound science, technology, and management assessment relative to policy decision-mailing, especially in areas that involve ecosystem health and sustainable development. It suggests an approach that involves a logical structure for evidence, a framed decision-making process, and an environment that encourages group participation. Toulmin-based logic possesses these characteristics and is used as the basis for development of the group decision support system described here. This system can support several user groups who can use the support system to state arguments for or against an important policy issue, and to assist in identifying and evaluating alternatives for implementation as policy decisions. The resulting decision support system assists in improving the clarity of the lines of reasoning used in specific situations; the warrants, grounds, and backings that are used to support claims and specific lines of reasoning; and the contradictions, rebuttals, and arguments surrounding each step in the reasoning process associated with evaluating a claim or counter-claim. Through use of this support system, experts and decision makers with differing views and backgrounds can better understand each other's thought processes in complex situations. The net effect is enhanced communications and understanding of the whole picture and, in many cases, consensus on decisions to be taken.

AB In this paper four energy scenarios for West-European passenger transport are developed. To start with, the present transport system as a baseline case is described and analysed. Next, for each scenario we sketch how the passenger transport system may look like in terms of the use of various existing and future transport technologies and the corresponding modal split. Based on this information, expected energy consumption features of the various transport modes are described, data on the present fuel supply and electricity generation system are offered, and estimations of the future energy system are given. Then, the energy consumption and CO2 emissions associated with the future passenger transport systems are assessed and these impacts are compared with the current system. The conclusion is that a large-scale reduction of CO2 emissions is possible in several ways. Each way will cause many problems, since drastic policy measures will have to be introduced, which may affect economic growth and the lifestyles of individuals.

AB This article contends that achieving trust and confidence in Internet systems is dependent on enhancing public perceptions that those who develop and manage Internet technologies are honest, capable, competent, and accountable. Drawing upon recent studies of the Inter net and on decision-support technologies, first outlined are the principal dimensions of trust and confidence in Cybersystems, including the growing distance between citizens and technology institutions, the credibility of information disseminated by Cybersystems, and the potential risks attendant upon Cybersystem use. It is posited that trust and confidence are dependent on the ability of the Internet and other computer-based communication systems to satisfy salient user needs. Five needs are paramount: real time information availability; accurate and precise data and information; usability and usefulness of information platforms; eas-of-use of communication systems; and access and accountability to users of Internet developers and data providers.

AB With the increasing trend of charging for externalities and the aim of encouraging the sustainable development of the air transport industry, there is a need to evaluate the real social costs of the undesirable side effects of aircraft noise and engine emissions. The mathematical models, based on extensive literature reviews of existing externality measurements, are developed to derive the social costs of noise and engine emissions from aircraft movements in monetary terms by using Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport as a case study. Furthermore, the results of a survey on the current noise and engine emissions charges are briefly described and compared. The hedonic price method is applied to calculate the annual social cost of aircraft noise during the landing and takeoff stages of the flight. In contrast, the direct evaluation method is applied to estimate the social cost of each engine exhaust pollutant during different flight modes. The empirical results have shown that the average social cost of noise per aircraft landing at Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport is similar to that of emissions, assuming a 30-min cruise time to landing or after takeoff. However, the uncertainty in the estimation of social costs for emissions is higher than that for noise, mainly because of the unknown effects of the exhaust pollutants on the upper atmosphere and on the climate.

AB Excess nitrogen corresponding to about 2-3 times the amount required for forage plant growth had been applied continuously for many years in dairy farms at Shisui machi, Kumamoto Prefecture in Kyushu because of the limited area of crop fields. Field experiments with reduced application of animal wastes (RAAW) which contained only half the amount of requirements for corn plant growth were conducted to decrease nitrate nitrogen (NN) accumulation and restore the mineral balance in corn plants and crop field soil in 6 dairy farms. (1)The NN concentration in the corn stem decreased to less than 5 g/kg (dry matter basis) and no whole plant shoots with a NN concentration above 2 g/kg were observed after the reduction of animal waste application for 1 year. (2) The content of exchangeable potassium (EK) in the dairy farm soil decreased from 60 to 27 mg/100g after RAAW for 2 years. (3) Average dry yield of corn plants in the 4th year was 16% lower in the case of RAAW than in the case of excess utilization of animal composts, but the difference was not significant. The concentration of K was lower in RAAW, which resulted in the decrease of the K/(Ca+Mg) equivalent ratio from 1.78 to 1.15 in the corn plants. These data suggest that RAAW can improve the feed quality by reducing the NN content and restoring the mineral balance in plant.

ID SHARED-MEMORY MULTIPROCESSORS
AB Scheduling parallel applications on shared-memory multiprocessors is a difficult task that requires a lot of tuning from application programmers, as well as operating system developers and system managers.
   In this paper, we present the characteristics related to kernel-level scheduling of the NANOS environment and the results we are achieving. The NANOS environment is designed and tuned specifically to achieve high performance in current shared-memory multiprocessors. Taking advantage of the wide and efficient dialog established between applications and the NANOS environment, we are designing powerful scheduling policies. The information exchanged ranges from simply communicating the number of requested processors to providing information of the current speedup achieved by the applications. We have devised several scheduling policies that use this interface, such as Equipartition, Variable Time Quantum DSS and Dynamic Performance Analysis. The results we have obtained with these policies indicate that there is a lot of work to do in the search for a "good" scheduling policy, which can include characteristics like sustainable execution times, fairness and throughput. For instance, we show through several experiments that benefits in execution time range from 15% to 100%, depending on the policy used and the characteristics of the workload.

AB Australian chairs in clinical nursing have been established in order to achieve more effective partnerships between academia and the health care sector in education, research and quality of nursing care. The aim of this study was to describe the goals, obstacles, supports and outcomes of such appointments. The study explored the perceptions of a purposive sample of Australian professors holding clinical chairs, stratified to ensure representation of both the geographical and clinical specialty diversity of the population. Eight professors were interviewed using semi-structured telephone interviews. The interviews covered three phases: role establishment, current foci and future developments. Qualitative analysis for common themes and areas of divergence was conducted with concurrent analysis providing the opportunity to seek confirmation for emerging themes. The participants highlighted the diversity of arrangements between university and health sector partners in establishing their respective roles. Clear communication was crucial to successful partnership arrangements. All roles included components of education, research and politics but the relative contribution of each of these areas depended to a large extent on the priorities of the employing partners. The participants felt the need to secure sustainable income sources and consolidate outcomes to ensure the continued viability of their positions. Clinical professorial nursing appointments provide one means of addressing perceived gaps in the links between the university and health care sectors, academia and clinicians, thus enhancing nursing education, research and politics. Through emphasizing common purpose and mutual respect, these positions can illuminate the crucial role nursing plays in Australian health care delivery.

AB This article explores the relationship between agricultural development theory and practice at the Office du Niger irrigation scheme in French Soudan (Mali). The Office du Niger was concerned in the 1920s within an elaborate social evolutionist model that sought to impose intensive plow agriculture and crop rotations on the farmers at the scheme. But Office planners were unable to realize their vision. Farmers rejected many project directives because they were inappropriate or incompatible with their priorities. By the mid-1940s, managers were forced to recognize that the project had not introduced an agricultural system that was sustainable in the long-run. Alongside Western scientific/technical approaches to ensuring the sustainability of farming at the project, managers made conscious use of local knowledge and local agricultural practices. Nonetheless, in their generalizing statements about African agriculture, Office managers and other French officials did not let go of their conviction of the superiority of European science and agriculture though their evolutionist pronouncements did become less coherent and confident. The disjunctures between social evolutionary theory and practical policies show that important changes in development policy may occur at the project level without overturning broader models of development. The persisting dominance of social evolutionary theory in French development thinking was, therefore, less determinant in shaping actual development activities than one might expect. This case throws into question the power attributed to large Western development institutions to determine development practice and asserts the importance of considering what went on at the grassroots when examining why development policies emerge, persist and change.

TI An explosive subsoiler for the improvement of meadow soil, Part 1:
   Thermodynamics
SO JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ENGINEERING RESEARCH

DT Article
AB The objective of this work was to develop a special subsoiler which would break down the impermeable horizons of meadow soil by using gas pressure explosions produced by injecting a fuel and air mixture. A major part of the soil volume would fail to withstand the gas pressure, and longer sustainability would be obtained. In this payer, an explosive subsoiler was envisaged and designed, and the gas pressure and temperature produced in an explosive gas producer were theoretically analysed.
   The results showed that the maximum temperature and pressure predicted in the combustion chamber was 3307 K and 16 MPa, respectively. These values decreased to 2607 K and 5.5 MPa when the engine crank angle was +25 degrees where the explosive gas could be taken from the combustion chamber and be utilized. These values also decreased steeply at larger dead volumes of the subsoiler body.
   The predicted temperature and pressure varied from 498 to 1780 K and from 0.4 to 1.5 MPa, respectively, with the range of the fuel injection. (C) 2000 Silsoe Research Institute.

AB Stakeholder engagement is a crucial concept of extension education. Engagement expresses democratic values of the land-grant mission by providing opportunities for stakeholders to influence program planning, including setting the agenda and negotiating resource allocations. In practice, the concept of engagement guides the formation of partnerships among extension, communities, industry, and government. In the area of sustainable agriculture, however, stakeholders may conflict, presenting challenges to the engagement process. Results from a study of a Canadian sustainable agriculture program, produced using cultural anthropology and participatory action research, detail challenges of the engagement process that led to reconstruction of a farmer-extension partnership. Notable in the early phase of the reconstruction process were critical reflection, stakeholder forums, exclusion through caucusing, and coalition building. An argument for a neo-pragmatist view provides a theoretical basis for understanding counterintuitive dimensions of engagement revealed by the study.

ID TRADE
AB Multiple negotiating rounds of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and World Trade Organization (WTO) since 1947 have conferred economic benefits through liberalized international trade. A growing body of evidence also points to linkages between liberalized trade and damage to the global environment, ecology, and natural resource base. Ironically, the increased economic well-being conferred by trade liberalization ultimately provides the basis for improved environmental protection. It is the interim environmental damage due to trade liberalization that is controversial and needing amelioration. The proposition here is to promote further trade liberalization, but only as long as environmental ethics and sustainability issues are satisfactorily addressed. Trade liberalization should not be permitted at the expense of adequate environmental protection and sustainability. Future WTO rounds need to address both development benefits and environmental ethics issues in a net social welfare maximization setting.

ID SAFETY; REVOLUTION; CROPS; FOODS
AB The concept of substantial equivalence, introduced for the risk assessment of genetically modified (GM) food, is a reducing concept because it ignores the context in which these products have been produced and brought to the consumer at the end of the food chain. Food quality cannot be restricted to mere substance and food acts on human beings not only at the level of nutrition but also through their relationship to environment and society. To make this context explicit, I will introduce an "equivalence scale'' for the evaluation of food chains (GM or not GM). By contrast with substantial equivalence, which involves mainly quantitative, analytical methods of evaluation, "qualitative equivalence'' refers to "less'' or non-substantial factors that require new methods of evaluation based on qualitative principles. "Ethical equivalence'' refers to factors that show the moral value contained in food products. To analyze the different levels at which ethics is needed in food chains, I will use the French principles: "Liberty, Equality, Fraternity," or freedom, equality, solidarity, and add a fourth principle: sustainability. Sustainability, solidarity, and freedom can be applied to the evaluation of environmental, socio-economic, and socio-cultural ethical equivalence, respectively. Equality refers to justice and should operate so as to guarantee that sustainability, solidarity, and freedom are satisfied. I suggest that ethics can provide a basis for a renewal of the food chain concept. Besides Quality Assurance, it is now essential to develop an "Ethical Assurance'' and this equivalence scale could provide a basis to set up "Ethical Assurance Standards'' (EAS) for food chains.

AB The use of genetic engineering in agriculture has been the source of much debate. To date, arguments have focused most strongly on the potential human health risks, the flow of genetic material to related species, and ecological consequences. Little attention appears to have been given to a more fundamental concern, namely, who will be the beneficiaries of this technology ?
   Given the prevalence of chronic hunger and the stark economics of farming, it is arguable that farmers and the hungry should be the main beneficiaries of agricultural research. However, the application of genetic engineering appears unlikely to benefit either of these two groups. This technology is largely controlled by the private sector, and its continued development hinges on its profitability. Thus, the only likely beneficiaries of the application of genetic engineering in agriculture are companies with the capacity to use it.

AB This article describes the feasibility of research into the relation between values of farmers and sustainability for the Dutch Ministry of Agriculture and the Dutch Federation of Agricultural and Horticultural Organisations.
   Firstly, a theoretical framework describes different levels of motivation behind conduct and choices. It enables exploration and analysis of individual interviews with small groups of conventional and ecological farmers. The aim is to find out what their basic convictions regarding nature and sustainability are, and to analyze the relation between these convictions and the actual choices they make in their farming practice. The research shows that for some farmers, differences in farming practice go back to the motivation level of moral convictions about what is 'good farming'. For others, the motivations for a specific fanning practice are more pragmatic or 'superficial'. This knowledge can be of significance for the process of policy making.
   Secondly, this research demonstrates that investigation into the relation between values and behavioral choices is possible. The analysis of interviews among a small group of farmers gives an idea of the importance of personal values in addition to (and sometimes of more importance than) economic considerations. Due to the restricted size of ther research population, however, these conclusions are of limited generalizability. Finally, in order to make a larger research agenda possible, the research methodology is evaluated on the basis of scientific criteria.

AB This paper seeks to find possibilities for reconciliation of the implementation of the precautionary principle and the promotion of international trade of genetically modified organisms, based on the assumption that a sustainable development is a right objective to-strive for. It starts with an explanation of the background and the role of the precautionary principle, and describes in what way measures based on the precautionary principle can easily lead to the creation of trade barriers. The article then examines to what extent the WTO (World Trade Organisation) Agreements allow the implementation of the precautionary principle. In addition, structural conflicts between the perception of the precautionary principle and the concept of trade liberalisation will be evoked. The last section of the paper analyses to what extent the WTO rules provide possibilities to,avoid or solve these conflicts in order to attempt to answer the main question: are the precautionary principle and the international trade of genetically modified organisms reconcilable?.

AB Animal husbandry has been accused of maltreating animals, polluting the environment, and so on. These accusations were thought to be answered when the Dutch research program "Sustainable Technological Development" (STD) suggested a government-initiated conversion from meat to novel protein foods (NPFs). STD reasoned that if consumers converted from meat to NPFs, non-sustainable animal husbandry would no longer be needed. Whereas STD only worried about how to construct NPFs with a meat bite, this paper draws attention to the presumed, but problematic, role for the government in the execution of the STD suggestions. Although vegetarians take the credo "You Are What You Eat" literally and accuse non-vegetarians of being beasts, a different interpretation is more promising: eating meat has become a leading thread in many lifestyles and narratives of self-identity. Since the freedom to follow your own lifestyle or consumptive preferences is a core value in contemporary affluent societies, government intervention in the formation and satisfaction of consumer preferences for meat dishes is a precarious issue. Hence, NPFs might be interesting for a small fraction of society, but we had better not expect too much from a government-initiated conversion from meat to NPFs as the answer to animal husbandry's problems.

   aspects
SO JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL & ENVIRONMENTAL ETHICS

ID FOREST
AB Stewardship is potentially a useful concept in modernizing management philosophies. Use of the term has increased markedly in recent years, yet the term is used loosely and rarely defined in land management literature. The connections between this practical usage and the ethical basis of stewardship are currently poorly developed. The following definition is proposed: "Stewardship is the responsible use (including conservation) of natural resources in a way that takes Cull and balanced account of the interests of society, future generations, and other species, as well as of private needs, and accepts significant answerability to society." A religious interpretation would require the phrase "and ultimately to God" to be added. Stewardship has both secular and religious interpretations and it will be desirable to develop both of these aspects in parallel. A task for philosophers is to establish whether the ethical basis of stewardship is sufficient to address environmental concerns or whether it is necessary to embrace wider ethical approaches. Stewardship occupies similar ground to several other concepts of use and management of resources, particularly sustainability. It can build on sustainability by encouraging a broader view of who and what should benefit from management activity. In particular, it focuses attention on the role of managers in providing public benefit and on envisaging other species as a form of "stakeholder" in management decisions. Stewardship is applicable across the widest range of fields of resource use and also has relevance to aspects of land tenure and property rights. Application of stewardship will require some adjustments in the roles of private managers/owners vis-a-vis government. It might provide managers with an expanded role and, importantly, a more positive image, both of themselves and in the eyes of the public. Stewardship could also be developed in a way that has relevance to citizens in general (as opposed to managers and owners of resources), through their interactions with natural resources as consumers.

AB Recent empirical work has questioned the consistency of US fiscal policy with an intertemporal budget constraint. Empirical results have tended to indicate that the deficit process has undergone at least one structural shift during recent decades, with the deficit becoming either unsustainable or sustainable in only a weak sense in the post-shift period. In this paper, we re-examine sustainability using a new approach, based on a cointegration model with multiple endogenous breaks. A Bayesian methodology is applied, incorporating Markov chain Monte Carlo simulators. In contrast to previous analyses, we find evidence of a sustainable deficit process over the 1947-1992 period, despite the occurrence of breaks during the 1970s and 1980s.

AB The debate about the sustainability and productivity of communal lands, especially in comparison with privately managed land, is far from settled. Emerging theories emphasize the spatial and temporal diversity of the environment, and are often in agreement with local opportunistic land management strategies. This study explores differences in Variables such as plant species richness, composition, and abundance of the field-layer and woody vegetation, between sites with different soils and different histories of land use (communal, private ranch, and rested from grazing), for 2 years. The results indicate that, for the study area chosen, differences in land use have not caused any major differences in the vegetation. However, there were clear differences depending on soil type, and plant production increased strongly with a slight increase in rainfall. Although people and livestock have had a strong impact on the vegetation, most indicators of degradation were absent, implying that the land has not lost its productive potential.

AB Reducing the environmental effects of construction is a continuing professional and social concern to promote sustainable development, in this paper, we estimate the major commodity and service inputs, resource requirements, and environmental emissions and wastes for four major U.S. construction sectors as defined by the Department of Commerce: (1) highway, bridge, and other horizontal construction [0.6% of the 1992 U.S. gross domestic product (GDP)]; (2) industrial facilities and commercial and office buildings (1.58 of GDP); (3) residential one-unit buildings (1.9% of GDP); and (4) other construction (towers, water, sewer and irrigation systems, railroads, etc.) (2.44 of GDP). Our estimates include the entire supply chain of material, energy, and service suppliers for these sectors with the use of a detailed 1992 input-output model of the U.S, economy and publicly available environmental data. We find that in general, the four major U.S, construction sectors appear to use fewer resources and have lower rates of environmental emissions and wastes than their share of the GDP might suggest.

AB Following Mourmouras [Scandinavian Journal of Economics 93 (1991): 585-591], in a Diamond [American Economic Review 55 (1965): 1126-1150] type overlapping-generations model with renewable natural resources a competitive path of manmade capital accumulation exists which meets the sustainability criterion of intergenerational natural-capital equ(al)ity (= sustainable growth). The alleged compatibility of decentralized optimization with natural-capital sustainability is appealing, but the relevance of this compatibility result is questionable: the growth factor of the renewable natural resource is assumed to be independent of the resource stock. Employing instead a nonlinear (logistic) regeneration function. this paper reconsiders Mourmouras' compatibility statement in another natural environment. It is shown that only under a certain complex relationship between the parameters of the utility, production, and natural-growth function does a nontrivial stationary state exist which is saddle-point stable, it exhibits by definition intergenerational natural-capital equality, but the nonlinear setting precludes in general, natural-capital equality across generations on the growth path towards the stationary state.

TI The sustainability of the water industry in a regulated environment
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL LAW
LA English
DT Article
AB A complex regulatory system now governs the privatised water industry in England and Wales. There is now a key question as to whether this system is adequate to ensure that the government's aim of sustainability can be achieved. Sustainability policies need to be considered in the light of the international, European and national initiatives, and many of these will impact on the water industry in England and Wales. Two areas are highlighted as of particular importance. The first concerns water resources and how water abstraction, leakage and flooding can be controlled alongside the corresponding uncertainty of global warming. Second, the issue of bathing water quality demonstrates problems of financing improvement programmes, and the adequacy of current programmes in ensuring a cleaner bathing water environment for the next generation. The issues have to be considered alongside the mechanisms and procedures for reaching decisions under the present regulatory framework. These decision-making structures will prove central to any robust sustainability for the water industry.

AB Inputs of P are essential for profitable crop and livestock production. However, its export in watershed runoff can accelerate the eutrophication of receiving fresh waters. The specialization of crop and livestock farming has created regional imbalances in P inputs in feed and fertilizer and output in farm produce. In many areas, soil P exceeds crop needs and has enriched surface runoff with P. This paper provides a brief overview of P management strategies to maintain agricultural production and protect water quality that were discussed at the conference, "Practical and Innovative Measures for the Control of Agricultural Phosphorus Losses to Water," sponsored by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and held in Antrim, Northern Ireland, June 1998. The purpose of the conference was to assess current strategies for reducing the loads and concentrations of P from agricultural land to surface waters. Topics discussed at the interdisciplinary conference and reviewed here included sustainable P management in productive agriculture; assessing land application of P; evaluating and modeling P transport and transformations in soil, runoff, streams, and lakes; and implementation of integrated best management practices (BMPs). From these discussions, measures to control agricultural P transfer from soil to water may be brought about by optimizing fertilizer P use-efficiency, refining animal feed rations, using feed additives to increase P absorption by the animal, moving manure from surplus to deficit areas, and targeting conservation practices, such as reduced tillage, buffer strips, and cover crops, to critical areas of P export from a watershed.

AB The management of P in agriculture must maximize the benefit to producers and minimize any adverse environmental effects, The latter arise from the loss of P from sail to standing freshwater. Even very small amounts of P can raise the concentration above the critical value for eutrophication, Such small quantities can be lost in eroded soil, in surface runoff and in drainage mater. The relative importance of these pathways depends on many factors, including topography, rainfall, Farming system, soil characteristics, and the bioavailability of the P that is lost. The success of agriculture in increasing food production to meet the increasing needs of humankind, especially since the 1950s, owes much to the use of P in fertilizers and animal feeds. What is now required is to ensure that P, a finite earth resource, is not wasted and that soils do not become so enriched with P that there is an unnecessary risk of too much P being carried to water from agricultural soils. The concept of taking account of critical soil P values to optimize the use of P in both fertilizer and manures is discussed here.

AB Integrated stormwater management is based on the natural processes in the water cycle and the criteria for sustainable development. The aim of this paper was to investigate which integrated stormwater system components might be suitable in cold climate regions. The evaluation was based on literature reviews and studies made in Lulea, Northern Sweden. It was found that porous pavement, grassed waterways (swales, ditches), wet pond, and percolation basin were the most suitable integrated stormwater system components in cold regions whereas dry basin, stormwater infiltration surfaces, and stormwater reuse seemed to be the less suitable. Polluted snow may be treated at a central (large-scale) snow deposit; cleaner snow may be placed in many local snow depots.

AB In Sweden there is a growing interest for sustainable storm water management. In many cities full scale facilities are being constructed and investigated. Examples of such facilities are storm water ponds, wetlands, open ditches, infiltration and percolation basins, and different treatment devices as settling tanks, lamella separators and others. Ln the paper examples of different solutions are given. Results from some investigations are presented and the advantages and disadvantages of different methods is discussed. Criteria for sustainability of storm water facilities are suggested.

ID OPTIMIZATION
AB A dynamic model based on the linear systems theory is developed in designing a highly cybernetic farming strategy to efficiently manage residuals generated in farm ecosystems. A linear cybernetic model would be used to describe the dynamic behavior of resource flow in the farm ecosystem in which the state variables are resource quantities, and the control variables are residual quantities. The controlled process is defined as the controlled management strategy change. Cybernetic mechanism shows the application of residuals as control measures have determinate effects on the controlled process as along as the farming system is observable and controllable in the control sense. To illustrate the model algorithm the idea is applied to simulate the dynamic response of residual phosphorus concentrations in an integrated pig/corn farming system located in the south Taiwan region. General results show that the residual phosphorous concentration is influenced by farming activities which are controlled by a system of gross input and net output parameters. This paper demonstrates using input-output analysis technique that residuals generated in the farming system is the most important cybernetic variable, so that the proper management of residuals alone has the potential to maintain future productivity and sustainability.

AB Over the past five years, the Oregon Department of Forestry has developed a new management plan for state forests in northwest Oregon. The approach results in healthy, productive, sustainable forest ecosystems and promotes the view that forest values such as timber and wildlife are compatible. Forest landscapes must be designed for wildlife habitat diversity, strategies must be operationally feasible, and the plan must be flexible enough to allow forest managers to address changes. Careful monitoring and an adaptive management approach are key to the plan's success over time.

ID AIDS
AB In this second part of the trilogy, I review the concepts of panic, the Theory of Cognitive Dissonance, and how internally inconsistent opinions and attitudes can be made consistent (or consonant). The theory explains, in some measure, how AIDS has been socialized into our thinking about identity, and goes beyond a medical condition. The pervasive identification of gay men with HIV and AIDS has resulted for many in an over-identification with fears of contagion and on a societal level in a fear of all gays as pools of contagion. The conversion of dissonance to consonance has taken many forms; within the gay community it has resulted in the rejection of the "100% safe-100% of the time" safe-sex message, and the adoption (for many) of a new form of deviant label-someone who is not in conformity with the social norm of gay community sexual behavior,
   However, we shall see that this so-called norm is a sham-that many gay men do not, as a rule, practice safe(r) sex on a consistent basis. This information indicates that the educational efforts of the last decade have at best lost their potency, and at worst were less than efficacious to begin with.
   The dissonant messages have also informed both the construction of the gay community and its interpretation of what it means to be gay. The result has been a tri-lateral perception of HIV and AIDS as either a medical, political or a social phenomenon. This fragmented understanding has exacerbated the already polarized ASOs and GSOs in that each has determined its ideology based on a particular interpretation of HIV and AIDS. This polarization has been operationalized by the GSOs and ASOs primarily in the manner by which they define their target markets, and more importantly, in the manner by which they exclude certain gays from participation. At the extreme, some gay men feel entirely Left out of the community, and are consequently unable to convert their dissonance regarding being gay into consonance, if only by developing some associational ties with the community.
   The central question of the sustainability of the Say movement is thus partly answered by restating the nature of the fractures in the community. Kiesler's determinants regarding change relate directly to the sustainability question-can CSOs and ASOs, given their pluralistic ideologies and constituencies, break free of the constraints that are posed by these determinants? Would the adherents and conscious constituents defect from their organizations, and form new ones (thus reifying the fractures that already exist)? On the other hand, is there a sense of community and identity that will function as a bonding agent to encourage coalition building and social reorganization?
   The matter may turn on the issue of selective rewards: can a coalition of ASOs and GSOs provide staff, volunteers and clients sufficient motivation for making the inevitable compromises? Given the selective nature of the rewards, as they now stand, the probability of being able to so do is remote. The influence of the non-gay community, as well as the attitudes and beliefs of the majority of gays who do not belong to any gay organizations, hampers success.

TI OPTIMIZATION BASED SOLUTION OF DENSITY DEPENDENT SEAWATER INTRUSION IN
   COASTAL AQUIFERS
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
ID SALTWATER INTRUSION; GROUNDWATER-MANAGEMENT; FRESH-WATER; MODEL; SYSTEMS
AB The numerical simulation of seawater intrusion with a considerable transition zone requires simultaneous solution of the discretized ground-water flow and transport equations. A nonlinear optimization method for solving the embedded governing equations for simulation of seawater intrusion is proposed. The main advantage of this optimization based method is that sequential iterative solution of the flow and transport equations is not necessary. Also, simultaneous solution of the flow and transport equations using the optimization approach uniquely suits the transformation of this simulation approach to a management model. Both steady-state and transient simulations are performed by using this methodology. The solutions obtained by using the proposed methodology are compared with results reported by other researchers. The obtained solutions compared satisfactorily with the known solutions. The formulation and solution of a nonlinear optimization model for maximizing total sustainable yield from specified locations of the aquifer, while satisfying stipulated salinity constraints, are presented to demonstrate the feasibility of integrating this simulation approach within a coastal aquifer management model.

TI The extension triad approach in disseminating agricultural information
   to extension workers: some experiences from the Southern Highlands Dairy
   Development Project, Tanzania
SO JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB The agricultural extension services in developing countries have been widely criticised for their ineffectiveness. The extension triad is considered to be an alternative and promising approach in an attempt to improve the extension services in such countries. This study investigates the information-seeking pattern of extension workers and the ways in which the Southern Highlands Dairy Development Project disseminates information to such workers, as well as the extent to which it addresses some of the common problems reported to hinder the extension services in developing countries. Out of 66 copies of a semi-structured questionnaire distributed to dairy extension supervisors and field extension workers within the Project area, 49 responses (69.7% response rate) were received. The use of personal sources, attendance at professional meetings, seminars, short courses and conferences and the reading of newspapers were found to be the three main information sources consulted by the respondents, while contact with researchers and the use of agricultural libraries were very unpopular. The Project extension services proved superior in comparison to the traditional extension services. For sustainability purposes, it is recommended that the Project, in collaboration with the Government and farmer groups, launches an alternative organisation to pursue activities run by the Project before it comes to an end.

AB Achieving a sustainable competitive advantage in global markets depends on the geographic scope and diversity of the firm's operations and their interlinkage, as well as on the extent of market integration and interdependence. The spatial configuration of the firm's assets, capabilities, and resources and the ability to manage and use these resources effectively are crucial elements of the firm's global strategy. The authors examine the nature of a firm's configural advantage in global markets in terms of its key components, capabilities, and management issues.

AB The authors examine preannouncements as strategic marketing communications aimed at influencing the perceptions and attitudes of industry stakeholders. The growth of the Internet points to the expanded importance of preannouncements. With an investigation of 265 chief executive officers (CEOs) and presidents from manufacturers of new products, the authors examine the effects of three firm-specific factors (first-mover predisposition, firm information interactivity, and competitive equity building) and one environmental construct (industry dynamism) on a firm's propensity to preannounce its future intended actions. The results indicate that competitive equity building, defined as a firm's tendency to pursue a high-profile leadership position within its industry, is the main driver of a firm's propensity to preannounce. Future directions for research include the development of a normative preannouncement framework and investigation of the role of preannouncements within the context of CEO marketing activities.

AB The concepts of critical theory an complexity merit criticism. Growth of knowledge merits paradigmatic sacrifices. The erosion of orthodox establishments and on on-going restructuring of research communities make then sciences of management susceptible to the influences of critical social scientists. A change of paradigms ceased to be a threatening emergency so vividly evoked by Kuhn. The new complex world of overlapping research networks is less hierarchic, more mobile, and not easily centralized. In boundary-less correlations all critical research paradigms, more mobile,and not easily centralized. In boundary-less correlations all critical research paradigms are subjected to a networking and re-networking at all times. Postmodernist anarchism ("anything goes") is presently giving rise to the theories of organizational learning. The latter express a methodological compromise with respect to the paradigms and a political; compromise with respect to the governance structures. The underlying tensions motivate an ongoing search for a sustainable compromise between a critical thrust of research and a managerial need for governance, accountability and control.

AB The structural and functional principles of the avian respiratory apparatus and the differences with respect to the respiratory apparatus of mammals have been well understood from published investigations since 1970 (for review articles see Duncker 1971, 1978a, 1979, 1983, Fedde 1986, Seller 1987, King & McLelland 1989). The various and great structural and functional differences between birds and mammals are often ignored or have only rarely found adequate treatment. In the face of the fundamental structural uniformity of birds, the large differences which exist in the functional efficiency of their respiratory and cardiovascular apparatus are nor generally realized. This applies to an even greater extent to their interaction and cooperation with the locomotory apparatus, especially when comparing the well-known domestic fowl with the more rarely examined wild and migratory birds. Migratory birds are vertebrates whose respiratory, cardiovascular and locomotory apparatus are capable of the highest sustainable effort. In contrast, the physiology of larger fowl-like birds is not designed for the purpose of hard and sustained exercise, but in accordance with their anaerobically performed short escape flight, the capacity of their cardiovascular and respiratory systems is greatly reduced. Fowl-like birds are therefore suitable only to a very limited extent to afford a functional understanding of avian construction. With this in mind the present article reviews the structure of the respiratory apparatus of birds with its important qualitative and quantitative structural and functional characteristics and the functionally important and correlated aspects of the cardiovascular and locomotory systems. Against this background these avian systems are compared with the functional characteristics of the corresponding mammalian systems.
   The lung air sac system of birds is related to the special construction of the avian trunk and the highly differentiated septation of the body cavity of birds (Fig. 1, Duncker 1971, 1979). The construction of the trunk wall and the septation of the body cavity are responsible for the volume constancy of the pleural cavity during all respiratory movements, thus establishing the necessary structural conditions for the development of the rigid parabronchial lung. Only under these conditions can the parabronchial air capillaries remain extended and air-filled. The ventilation of this rigid avian lung is achieved by the volume changes of the air sacs, whereby the air flow through the parabronchi is directed aerodynamically. The relative rigidity of the avian trunk with its highly specialized articulations between the spinal column, which is more or less immobile, and the ribs and the sternum enables large excursions for the breathing movements so that ventilation of the air sacs can occur with a large amplitude and at minimum pressure differences. By virtue of the large volume elasticity (compliance) of the air sacs the respiratory apparatus of birds works as a low-pressure system. In addition, owing to the special construction of the shoulder girdle of birds as well as to the arrangement of the large flight muscles and the air sac diverticula between the cranial shoulder girdle and the frontal thorax, complete dissociation of respiratory and Right movements can result, which allows birds to fly and to breath with different, even changing frequencies, which are related specifically to body size (Fig. 5; Berger & Hart 1974).
   In contrast to this avian construction, the mammalian trunk, especially in small to medium-sized mammals. possesses a strongly elastic thorax and a highly pliant lumbar vertebral column, which result in a couplings between locomotory and respiratory movements. The thoracic cage and the cervical and thoracic vertebral column represent the crucial origins for the musculature of the shoulder girdle including its highly mobile scapula. The extensive movements of the lumbar vertebral column are substantial for the locomotory movements of the hind limb. Owing to its small volume elasticity (compliance) and powerful retractile forces, the broncho-alveolar mammalian lung requires larger pressure gradients for full inspiration. Thus, the thorax musculature and a muscularized diaphragm are well developed. In addition to the performance of its inspiratory movements, the diaphragm must also counteract the high intraabdominal pressures, which are an inevitable consequence of the extensive movements of the lumbar vertebral column and the active abdominal muscles, especially during rapid locomotion. Thus, the body cavities of mammals including the pleural cavity are high-pressure systems, which have multiple, not yet investigated effects on the structure and function of different organ systems. Just as the structure and function of the lung air sac apparatus of birds differ fundamentally fi om the lungs of mammals, the ontogenetic development of the respiratory apparatuses of these two classes are also basically different. In viviparous mammals the lung develops similarly to all lungs of amniotes secreting pul,nonary fluid, which fills the lumina of the developing bronchial tree including its respiratory portion. With the onset of respiratory movements in the late embryological/fetal development, this pulmonary fluid comes into partial exchange with the amniotic fluid. During parturition, a portion of the pulmonary fluid is squeezed out by the compression of the fetus. The remaining pulmonary fluid, which is suked into the terminal ends of the respiratory bronchial tree by the first breath, will be resorbed in the first few hours of life by active transport of the alveolar epithelium and the endothelium of the alveolar capillaries. Thus, the mammalian lung, which has developed a thin exchange surface in the sacculi or alveoli of the respiratory bronchial tree, can aerate most of the exchange surface with the first breath at birth so that it can instantly take over the function of gas exchange from the placenta (Duncker 1990).
   The avian lung and its principal air sacs develop in the embryo, which is emersed in the amniotic fluid of the egg. Similarly, the lumina of the growing bronchial system are filled with pulmonary fluid. Towards the end of the incubation period the sir capillaries start to sprout from the tubuli of the fluid-filled anlagen of the parabronchi between the surrounding blood capillaries. One to three days before hatching, after having swallowed the remaining amniotic fluid, and initiated regular breathing movements, the chick perforates the membrane into the air chamber of thr egg (Duncker 1978b, Piiper 1978). Thus, not only the primary and secondary bronchi of the lung and the large air sacs are ventilated, but also the lumina of the parabronchi. The parabronchial air capillaries, which continue growing and spl outing, are filled with pulmonary fluid, which is now absorbed by the epithelium of the air capillaries and the endothelium of the blood capillaries. Depending upon the size of the egg and the duration of the incubation, the air capillaries are completely air-filled after one to two days. With this ventilation and the increasing filling of the air capillaries with air, they progressively assume the gas exchange function, which up to this time has been carried out by the chorioallantoic membrane. The latter is closely attached to the inside of the shell membrane. At the end of this process the embryo hatches. As early as in the embryological development the pleural cavities maintain volume constancy during all respiratory and body movements. The rigid lungs, which grow together with the pleural cavity walls during their embryological development, attain their gas exchange ability after ventilation of the bronchial system only through the resorption of the pulmonary fluid by the epithelium of the air capillaries. The avian lung therefore can only attain its functional capacity for gas exchange by a temporal overlapping of gas exchange by the chorioallantoic membrane with the respiration of air by the lung, which is only possible in a hard-shelled egg. Thus, the highly differentiated, non-inflatable lung structure in birds is inevitably bound to development in a hard-shelled egg (Duncker 1978b).
   All birds possess a respiratory apparatus that in principle is comparably constructed. They differ vastly, however in the extent to which the diffusion capacity of their lungs is developed and thus in their metabolic and locomotory efficiency. Those capable of sustained, efficient flight, e.g. hummingbirds to large migratory birds, possess lungs with an exchange capacity that is higher than that of comparably large mammals by a factor of 6 to 8 (Fig. 27). The relative weight of the heart of birds and their cardio-vascular transport capacity are correspondingly larger than in comparable mammals and they have a somewhat larger relative blood volume (Duncker & Guntert 1985). By virtue of this construction, sustainably flying birds can supply their flight musculature, which consists to a large extent or completely of aerobic muscle fibers, which are sufficient for a continuous flapping type flight activity. However, a crucial body-size relationship arises within these functional interdependencies, since the hearts of larger animals can only pump a relatively smaller blood volume per time unit owing to the size-dependent maximum pulse rate. Accordingly, large ducks, geese and swans adapt to these scale problems by a reduction in their relative flight muscle mass, which entailes them using a longer time for take-off with violent flapping of their wings (Fig. 28). Large water birds can perform such a long take-off only on water, out of reach of preying terrestrial hunters.
   Large land birds, like the large fowl-like birds, owe their survival to the fact that they can save themselves from stalking hunters by a direct lifting flight, in order to escape into a tree or by sweeping off to a safe distance. For a direct lifting flight, however, a flight muscle mass of at least 20 % of their total body weight is necessary. Larger sustainably flying birds had to reduce their aerobic, red flight musculature to 13 - 12 % of their total body mass in accordance with the described body-size dependent cardio-vascular blood transport capacity. Based on these scaling interdependencies, the medium- to large-sized fowl-like birds could not differentiate aerobic fibers in their flight musculature. Because of the requirement that flight musculature must amount to 20 % of body weight for lifting stroke flight, they were able to differentiate their flight muscles only as anaerobic, white fibers and thus they can fly strongly but fatigue very quickly (Fig. 28). Accordingly, the heart and circulatory system has also differentiated to the physiological needs of the flight musculature. Thus, the size of the heart and the cardio-vascular transport capacity of larger fowl-like birds are reduced to half of or less than the heart size and transport capacity of comparably large sustainably flying birds, and they possess an even more greatly reduced diffusion capacity of their lungs. Medium-sized and large fowl-like birds passed up the development of the ability for sustainable higher metabolic permormance during their very special evolution towards a moro terrestrially based, "running" bird with short escape flight. The fowl-like birds, adapted very well to their specific habitat, therefore are not an appropiate example of achievement.

AB The scientific study of rangelands in the western United States, started with the first collection of natural history specimens in the 18th century. Gradually over the 19th century, a basic catalog of the plants, animals, and geography of the far west was assembled. After the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) was organized, scientists were sent to the western ranges on fact-finding missions designed to assess the existing range livestock industry and its potential. At the turn of the 19th to the 20th century, a few visionary scientist began to conduct actual experiments in rangeland environments. The Forest Service, USDA, was established in 1905, and what had been Forest Reserves from the U.S. Department of Interior (USDI) were transferred to the new agency. It was responsible for sustainable timber product and watershed management on millions of acres of wild lands. The Forest Service soon discovered that livestock grazed on four-fifths of the National Forest land and it was estimated that 85% of these rangelands were over-grazed and subject to accelerated erosion. The Forest Service started preliminary research on rangelands in 1907 and formally started an Office of Grazing Studies in 1910. Beginning with the Great Basin Experiment Station in 1912, a series of stations were developed by the Forest Service. As agricultural experiment stations developed at Land Grant colleges in the western states, state sponsored research on rangelands increased in importance.

AB The long-term sustainability of pasture management systems, whether related to structural stability or nutrient dynamics, is dependent upon maintaining soil biological properties. This study investigates the extent to which the microbiological and biochemical properties of soil can change with season and pasture management system, including their likely value as indicators of soil quality. The experiment was conducted on a 30-ha pasture near Brandon, Manitoba, Seasonal fluctuations were observed in the soil microbial and biochemical properties. In general, these fluctuations were mainly independent of the small variations in soil organic matter content but were more closely related to soil water content. The data also suggests an impact of stocking rate and grazing system on soil microbial biomass C and on N mineralization potential. However, because duration of the investigation, limited number of replications and the high soil variability encountered, it is not yet possible to recommend any particular grazing system and/or stocking rate favorable for the maintenance of soil biological quality. The trends suggest that light, continuous grazing systems had the largest microbial biomass and nutrient mineralizing activity.

AB Having retreated somewhat from use in rural studies over The last two decades; the concept of 'community' has emerged once again as a signifier of both research scale and cultural meanings about social life and rurality. This paper reviews the heritage of recent 'community' studies bur argues that the term holds further analytical potential. In order to build a conceptual framework for a more robust 'community' analysis, reference is made to four themes in wider social theory. These themes partially challenge, but cumulatively energize and enhance, a notion of 'community' that is presented in the remainder of the paper. A proposal is outlined which would encourage, first, a study of the contexts and people involved in shaping 'community', and second, an analysis of the meanings, practices, and spaces and structures which are interconnected in characterising the material and cultural operation of such 'communities'.

AB Three erosion control method of using a tree hedge, a grass hedge, and a combination of the two were used On an alfisol in central Kenya. Soil loss, biomass field, and profile survey of the runoff plots were measured during two cropping seasons. Average Cumulative soil loss from plots with hedges of tree, combination, grass, and non hedged control were 5.6, 7.4, 11.2, and 10.9 Mg ha(-1), respectively. Dry matter yields were 2.98, 9.24, and 11.90 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) for tree, combination, and grass hedge respectively. Topographic survey of the plots showed a near uniform terrace formation and decrease in slope of about 0.2 % for all hedges, but an increase in slope for the control plots by the same magnitude. Small-scale farmers in the highland of Central Kenya who practice a mixed farming system could use this soil conservation technology as a step towards sustainable farming practices.

TI Ethnoeconomics in sustainable agricultural development: The Nigerian
   case
SO JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
DE ethnoeconomics; agricultural sustainability; and traditional
   productivity
AB Sustainable agricultural development is relatively sophisticated and made up of two major sectors, i.e., the formal and the informal methods in agricultural sustainability. In spite of the significant: progress made in the reform of sustainable agricultural development in the last few years, it is clear that informal productive activities have continued to grow in size and sophistication. The traditional informal economic activities dominated by local club operators have continued to flourish. The continued existence and growth of the informal traditional economic production has existed outside the control of government regulations. Hence, the activities of the informal traditional agricultural development are either misreported, under-reported or, in some cases totally omitted. Thus, the activities of informal productive development would explain how peasant farmers generate funds from their internal savings to finance their agricultural development projects in Nigeria where incomes are relatively low.
   This study shows that informal productive development in Nigeria is ubiquitous especially as Nigeria is a low income country and based on the informal traditional productive activities the Nigerians find good opportunity to smoother their consumption.

ID CHEMICAL-COMPOSITION
AB Land application of municipal collected shade tree (MCST)-leaves is a permitted practice in New Jersey that may be useful in sustainable agriculture. The material helps build soil organic matter, but its overall impact on soil properties and nutrient levels needs to be determined. This study, conducted near Pittstown, NJ on a Quakertown silt loam (fine-loamy-mixed, mesic, Typic hapludult) from 1991 to 1994, examined the effects of MCST-leaves on soil organic matter content, pH, and soil test levels of nutrients and heavy metals, following three years of annual applications at 0, 22.5 and 45 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) Soil samples were collected four years after the initial application of MCST-leaves to evaluate treatment effects. Soil organic carbon levels increased from 13.9 g kg(-1) in the unamended soil to 17.1 g kg(-1) in the 22.5 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) rate of MCST-leaves and to 18.4 g kg(-1) for the 45 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) rate. About 17% of the C that was added to the soil as MCST-leaves remained in the soil one year after the end of the three-year period of annual applications. Soil organic nitrogen levels increased from 1.0 g kg(-1) for the unamended soil to 2.0 g kg(-1) for the 45 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) rate. Soil pH levels and Mehlich-3 extractable P, K, Cu, Mn, Zn, Co, Cd, Pb, Ni and Cr were unchanged by the applications of MCST-leaves while levels of Ca and B were increased. Percentage of exchangeable Ca increased in the amended soil while the exchangeable Mg decreased. The practice of land applying MCST-leaves is consistent with sustainable agriculture, to raise soil organic matter and Ca levels without causing an excessive buildup of soil test P.

AB With the cessation of World Bank counterpart funding of extension service in Nigeria, most of the Agricultural Development Programs have been finding it difficult to adequately and effectively fund extension activities. The aim of the study was to identify sustainable alternative internal sources of funds for extension service. A sample of 400 small scale-farmers, 12 large-scale farmers, 12 chief executives of agro-allied, agro-based and multinational companies, 20 local government chairmen and 25 very wealthy citizens of Ogun State, Nigeria were either interviewed or asked to respond to a questionnaire. Results indicated that all the five groups of respondents were willing to counterpart-fund extension service in Ogun State. More than 1/3 of the actual amount spent on extension service may be realized through alternative internal sources of funds. Farm size, income, educational level, length of contact with extension service and gender of small-scale farmers had significant correlation with their willingness to contribute to fund extension service. It was recommended that Ogun State Agricultural Development Program should establish a committee or subunit (under Extension sub-program) whose main function will be to search for and generate funds locally. It will also be charged with managing such funds.

AB The concept of an Ideal Soil (IS) has been presented in a previous paper where soil attributes have been grouped in four functions or services that they must render to crops. However, attributes of an IS have critical values, which must be above certain Critical Thresholds (CT). Here we are proposing some edaphic variables which are taken as parameters of the physical state, chemical composition and biological activity of such soils (especially in Mollisols in Argentinian North Pampean Region). Based on our own experience, we also show the appropriate measurement techniques and critical thresholds of the soils.

   agri-ecotourism; community supported agriculture; holistic management
AB Agricultural production in the US and the EC has expanded so successfully over the last 40 years that both governments are now seeking ways to limit it and the resulting environmental costs. The EC is therefore encouraging habitat management payments which provide public environmental benefits instead of crop subsidies to farmers. The 1996 Farm Bill in the US is following a similar approach with a transitional buyout program.
   This paper compares habitat payment programs between the two regions and provides examples of how farmers can integrate sustainable agriculture with habitat management for an economic return. A case study of a 3,200-acre coastal ranch in central California demonstrates some alternatives to achieve this.

AB This paper reports the effectiveness of plastic shelters in overcoming soil-related and biotic constraints to vegetable production in Belize, Central America, where rainy-season tomatoes and sweet peppers are almost totally destroyed by geminiviruses. Use of pesticides is rampant, while rapid decline in soil productivity induces farmers to abandon previously used lands acid clear new lands from virgin forests. We postulated that plants growing in the open-field environment are infected early by the soil-borne pathogens deposited on the plants from clouds of fine soil particles arising from the soil splash during high-intensity rainfall. The products of fungal and bacterial decay attract white flies (the vector for geminiviruses) and plants already weakened by the infection succumb easily to the viruses. A production system in which plant and soil surfaces are protected from direct rainfall using plastic shelters, was designed and field tested with tomatoes and sweet peppers. On average, plastic shelters increased tomato and sweet pepper yields by 169% and 96%, respectively, without any use of pesticides. Weed growth under the shelter was negligible, and plants maintained greenness and production well into the fourth month after transplanting. In contrast, open-field plots were infested with weeds, and plants were completely destroyed by the middle of the third month. The number of white flies visiting the plastic-shelter plants was only about 28% of that in the open-field. We conclude that total protection of soil and plant surfaces from rainfall is the most effective plant protection measure. The proposed system uses small land area on a continuous basis, provides stable production, requires little or no plant protection chemicals, and raises Farmer income.

DE vegetable intercropping; montmorillonitic soils; sustainability;
   sub-humid tropical climate
AB The studies were carried out to ascertain the sustainability of intercropped versus sole crop vegetable cultivation in black montmorillonitic clay soil (Typic Haplustert), on the basis of response on indices of sustainability such as growth attributes, yield, quality, net return analysis, crop nutrient uptake, soil fertility changes, land equivalent ratio (LER) and sustainability value index (SVI). The combination of cabbage plus radish produced highest yield followed by cabbage plus spinach and cabbage plus coriander. Qualitywise, the total soluble solids in cabbage showed no significant difference with any of the six intercrops tested. The economics of total yield produced revealed highest net monitory return with cabbage plus radish followed by cabbage plus spinach, cabbage plus coriander and cabbage plus sorrel. The spinach contained maximum N and K content, while radish proved to be a better accumulator of P. The sole crop of cabbage removed higher N, P and K, when compared with cabbage intercropped with sorrel, indicating less nutrient exhaustion under intercropped cabbage. On the basis of total nutrient uptake by main crop and intercrop, the maximum N, P and K were removed by cabbage plus radish followed by cabbage plus spinach. No significant reduction in soil available pool of nutrients was noted despite such a high magnitude of nutrient removal by different main crop-intercrop combinations. The LER and SVI were highest, with cabbage plus radish followed by cabbage plus spinach in comparison to monocultured cabbage, indicating the superiority of intercropped cabbage over a sole: crop. These observations warrant a strong potential of improving vegetable production through intercropping on a sustained basis using a compatible cropping strategy.

TI Soil fertility status in the communal areas of Zimbabwe in relation to
   sustainable crop production
SO JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE

DE maize-based fields; village-level assessment; regional level assessment;
   nutrient decline; general acidification
AB Improvement and maintenance of soil fertility is the major constraint to sustainable crop production in the communal areas (CAs) or peasant farming areas of Zimbabwe. This study assessed soil fertility status in CAs at two levels, i.e., regional and village levels. The regional soil fertility assessment was based on soil samples submitted by CA farmers to the Soil Testing Laboratory of the Chemistry and Soil Research Institute (CSRI) for analysis and fertilizer recommendations in 1992-1994. It was assumed that these samples would represent the general soil fertility conditions in the most crop production-based CAs since CSRI soil testing service is the only one normally available for farmers in the CAs. To assess soil fertility status at village level, systematic soil sampling in maize-based fields was conducted in Chinamhora and Mhondoro CAs using mapping units of 1-10 km(2), which would presumably capture some effects of farmer soil management on soil fertility status. The regional assessment revealed that 77% of the soils required lime (pH [CaCl2] < 5.0) far most crops, and problems of potential Al toxicity (pH [CaCl2] < 4.3) and P deficiency in over 40% of the soils. Serious problems were incidences of very low N (82%) and marginal to deficient P (84%) levels. The levels of K and Mg were generally adequate (94%). The village Level assessment showed wide variations in soil properties between fields of less than 2 hectares within distances of about 1 km. This implied high probability of multiple soil fertility problems for crops in the CAs. Compared to previous assessments, the results revealed that there is a general acidification and decline in the nutrient status of CA soils. Soil fertility management effects were implied by the lower incidences of P deficiency in the more heavily fertilized Chinamhora CA, and lower incidences of potential Al toxicity and low K at the regional level than at village level which suggested greater use of acidifying N fertilizers and more depletion of soil K under maize. Acidification and depletion of nutrients may become even greater constraints to crop production in the CAs if the trend continues, especially under maize.

AB In West Africa, climate influences (i) virus disease outbreaks, (ii) the rate of development and activity of virus vectors and also of their migration, and (iii) the phenology of crops, weeds and wild hosts that harbor plant viruses. Rainfall, temperature and wind are identified as key weather components in virus pathosystems involving maize (cereal), okra (vegetable) and cassava (tuber crop), and are therefore important in determining the most suitable period in which to undertake crop protection measures. The intricate interrelationships among cropping seasons, intercrop periods and virus incidence in West Africa must be thoroughly understood in order to develop ecologically-based and sustainable management practices. This calls for a greater cooperation between agrometeorologists and those involved in crop protection.

ID METAANALYSIS
AB Studies of the profitability of organic and no-till grain cropping systems relative to that of conventional systems were compared and analyzed. In all, enough information was collected from the literature for 321 separate profitability results including 120 direct comparisons of organic production to conventional and 144 no-till vs. conventional direct comparisons for North American grains for a metaanalysis. The first part of the analysis was a standard, descriptive summary of the data. This showed that the relative profitability of organic production was, on average, higher for corn and grain sorghum and if the research was conducted at a research experiment station. No-till averaged higher profitability in on-farm trials and with oilseeds, corn and grain sorghum in the descriptive analysis. Then the study proceeded with a meta-analysis of the economic comparisons. The meta-analysis results indicated that study location (Eastern, Central or Western North America) was a key factor in explaining the relative profitability of each alternative cropping system relative to the conventional system. In addition, study type (on-farm or research station experiment) and type of grain crop (small grain, oilseed, other) were important in explaining the relative profitability of both systems.

AB The payer examines the scope of issues related to sustainable agricultural practices associated with weed control in Iowa. The results of the survey indicated that a majority of respondents use sustainable agricultural practices associated with weed control, and continued to show interest in learning about those practices they consider sustainable. Respondents are likely to get interested in learning about the practices they already use. Demographic characteristics of the respondents (age, level of education attained, number of years in farming, number of acres owned and acres rented) played some role in the management decisions regarding the adoption of sustainable agricultural practices.

AB The attainment of sustainable food security in sub-Saharan Africa requires the efforts of a large cadre of well-trained agricultural resource specialists familiar with the constraints and perspectives of smallhold farmers and experienced in interdisciplinary problemsolving. The Forum for Agricultural Resource Husbandry (FORUM) was initiated in 1992 by The Rockefeller Foundation to stabilize Faculties of Agriculture in Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Uganda and Zimbabwe by providing resources, mission and peer support, leading to knowledge contributing to improved lives of smallhold farmers. The focus of this effort is improvement in the quality of training at the Master of Science (M.Sc.) level. The FORUM is a competitive grants programme with well-defined objectives, proposal requirements and technical review procedures. Applicants must not only identify an approach to better understanding and improving a smallholder cropping system, but also to show how M.Sc. students play a central role in research. To date, 56 grants providing US $4.6 million were awarded to 40 Principal Investigators at nine universities resulting in scholarship opportunities for 121 students and the publication of 55 scientific papers. Mechanisms for improving M.Sc.-level agricultural education include distance learning in biometrics, presentation of awards to winners of student competitions, collaboration between universities in student supervision and comparison of M.Sc. programmes between universities. The FORUM approach is easily replicated and other organizations interested in strengthening the abilities of African universities to undertake relevant agricultural research are encouraged to design similar programmes.

AB Nebraska producers have been applying agricultural chemicals to their crop land through irrigation systems since the 1960s. Beginning in 1987, environmental regulatory requirements were implemented to prevent water contamination associated with this practice. The purpose of this paper is to use the contingent valuation method to estimate the value chemigation producers place on a reduction in ground and surface water contamination from agricultural chemicals, and to estimate producer surplus associated with a change in environmental quality resulting from the adoption of a new chemigation technology. The analysis shows that a sample of Nebraska certified chemigation applicators indicated positive willingness to pay estimates to reduce water pollution from agricultural chemicals applied through irrigation systems.

AB Enhancing soil quality in intensive agricultural systems is important to sustaining productivity and improving environmental quality. Crapping systems play an important role in determining soil physical characteristics and in nutrient cycling mechanisms. Field experiments were conducted at the Agronomy Farm of The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio on a well-drained Miamian silty-clay loam soil to assess cropping systems effects on soil physical properties. There were a total of 11 cropping system treatments involving 6 cover crops, 4 crop rotations and a fallow plot. All cropping system treatments were managed at two fertilizer levels. Dry soil aggregate stability, mean weight diameter, and moisture retention were determined for the 0-10 cm layer. Aggregate stability was high (93-96%), and not significantly affected by cropping systems and fertilizer levels. The mean weight diameter of aggregates varied from 5.9 to 6.1 mm. The cropping systems had no significant effect on mean weight diameter but the fertilizer level had a significant effect on it. The effect of cropping system treatments on soil moisture retention characteristics was significant only at near field capacity (-0.1 MPa suction).

SO JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE

DE bean seed; seed multiplication; seed dissemination; promotional
   strategies
AB Farmers have shown considerable interest in purchasing seed of newly released dry bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) varieties in Malawi. However, this seed is not available on a large scale to farmers at present. The private seed sector in the country is not interested in bean seed production due to low profit margins. As a self-pollinating crop, once farmers have obtained initial seed stock, it can be recycled for some time. A strategy has been developed to focus on alternative sustainable informal seed production and dissemination systems, which builds on lessons learnt from previous experiences within Malawi and other African countries. These include: (i) informal seed multiplication, using smallholder farmers; (ii) informal seed distribution channels, using grocery shops, rural traders, extension agents, health clinics, and NGOs; and (iii) intensified variety promotion through publicity, using posters, leaflets, brochures and radio messages. These activities are carried out in close collaboration with farmers, NGOs, extension agencies, village traders and various other institutions. The results from initial sales through informal distribution channels were encouraging and 80% of the seed was sold.

ID PARTICIPATORY DESIGN
AB The 'fit' of information and communication technologies (ICT) in community health is important in meeting the needs of patients, carers, staff and organizations in the delivery of services. A good fit leads to greater efficiencies and effectiveness in ICT use. A multi-step research project was conducted to look not only at the role of ICT but at how to manage ICT and make a good ICT fit to enhance community health services. Telehealth was identified as the application of ICT to enhance population health, health promotion and health-service delivery. A participatory process was identified as critical to determining needs and potential uses as well as to the successful design and implementation of ICT in health. There was additional value in ensuring a diversity of desired outcomes which balance costs and benefits while fostering capacity and technical sustainability.

Over the long term, wolves accounted for at least 14-22% of die inter-year variation in buck harvest in the region, but an unknown amount of variation in hunter effort may have obscured any more precise estimate. For part of the area with poorest habitat, we found strong inverse relationships (r(2) = 0.66-0.84) between annual wolf numbers and buck harvests from 1988 to 1995 when hunting pressure was considered relatively constant. However, in better habitat, where our buck harvest sample was larger, we found no evidence of wolves influencing buck harvest. Our findings tend to confirm the suitability of the Minnesota Department of Natural Resource's deer harvest regulations for a sustainable yield.

AB Anterograde conduction over fast and slow pathways was studied in 150 patients with paroxysmal reciprocal atrioventricular nodal tachycardia. influences of types of atrio-ventricular conduction and other electrophysiological parameters on possibility of initiation of paroxysms of nodal tachycardia and their sustainability were also studied. Transesophageal pacing of the heart showed that definite critical relationships between conduction times and refractory periods of structures constituting re-entry circuit were necessary for the formation of sustained nodal tachycardia. Parameters of conduction time over alternative pathway and values of effective refractory periods established in the study allowed to determine criteria of sustainability of paroxysmal reciprocal nodal tachycardia.

SO LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT

DT Article
DE indigenous soil and water conservation; soil productivity; participatory
   research and development; subSaharan Africa
ID KNOWLEDGE
AB Farmers in many parts of Africa use indigenous soil and water conserving (ISWC) practices as an integral part of their farming systems. Farmers have developed such methods which have maintained productivity and contributed to long-term sustainability, while introduced measures have often been rejected or simply failed to achieve their technical objectves,
   This paper examines the strengths and weaknesses of some ISWC practices in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania. An evaluation has been carried out based on farmers' evaluation criteria as well as criteria identified by researchers, Farmers' criteria are often based on the quality of their natural resources (farmers are more likely to conserve those soils that will give the highest return on the:ir investment), the resource level of the household (particularly income levels and labour availability), cropping intensity as well as cultural traditions related to age, education and gender. Of great importance, however, is the need to maintain or increase soil productivity. Methods that conserve moisture, reduce soil erosion, maintain soil fertility and increase productivity, which are socially acceptable and economically viable, are those which farmers favour. ISWC practices often have these qualities but farmers have not always been able to adjust the techniques to rapid changes in farming systems and increasing intensity of land use.
   Soil productivity and economic modelling indicate that although yields declines are lower when traditional technologies are used, long-term productivity remains a problem. There is an urgent need to work closely with farmers to improve and develop traditional SWC techniques, Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

ID KNOWLEDGE
AB The steeplands worked by Malaysian farmers are being severely degraded by loss of fertility, landsliding and soil erosion. Although the need to conserve and carefully manage agricultural land is clearly stated in government policies, the actual outcomes of policy implementation are often not effective, real government action appearing to be concentrated on alleviating urban environmental problems rather than on sustainable use of rural land. Detailed investigations in villages in western Sabah, Malaysia Borneo, found that lack of commitment to ensure the long-term sustainability of the land farmed by the rural poor was reflected in the types of training programme of the agricultural extension service field workers, and the advice and practices encouraged by the government.

ID QUATERNARY VEGETATIONAL HISTORY; NORTHWEST GREECE
AB An analysis has been undertaken of the land-use evolution in the island of Lesvos for the last 5000 years, based on historical and archaeological documents and recent soil and vegetation survey data. A series of maps were compiled using historical documents for the period from 3300 BC to 1886 BC and vegetation field survey data for the period from 1886-1996. A soil survey (scale 1:50 000) was conducted in 1996 in order to relate the land-use changes to the present physical environment.
   Cultivation of the land started around 3300 Be and intensified during the 18th century BC. During the Roman period forests were already significantly reduced to satisfy the increasing demands for agricultural products, timber and heating. In the Byzantine period (4th-15th century), vineyards and pastures expanded, mainly by clearing the forests. Olive plantations increased during the 13th century, motivated by the allocation of subsidies. During the first centuries of the Ottoman period, there was a further expansion of olive groves and pastures by reducing forests, while vineyards declined. Great changes occurred in the last century in the geographical distribution and the total area occupied by the various types of land use. Olive groves significantly expanded and were redistributed covering more fertile and productive land on hilly areas by clearing mainly pine forests, Oak forests increased on previous pasture areas.
   Today, pasture is the main type of land use in hilly areas. These previously forested areas have been cleared without any accompanying measures against soil erosion. This highly degraded land with shallow and severely eroded soils is not able to sustain any profitable agricultural use or natural forest. However, areas cultivated with olives remained sustainable for more than seven centuries without being significantly degraded. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Periodic monitoring of the status of natural resources is fundamental to generating adequate information for planning and policy-making for their sustainable management. This paper provides an overview of the concepts, issues and challenges that planners and policy makers face in designing natural resource monitoring systems and using their outcomes in the formulation of policies and intervention programs. It begins with a discussion of a new conceptual framework for monitoring based on resource management domains (RMDs), which defines monitoring units based on resource problems and potential policy interventions. This is followed by a description of steps necessary for effectively implementing a monitoring system and possible flows and use of information in decision-making. Finally, the paper identifies issues relevant to the design of natural resource monitoring systems, and future challenges facing governments, academic institutions, and donor agencies. The paper concludes that a monitoring system which is simple, user-driven, based on existing institutional structures, and has the commitment of decision makers for using the information in policy design and program development is more likely to be successful.

   Jakarta, Indonesia
SO LAND USE POLICY
LA English
DT Article
DE globalisation; centre-periphery; urbanisation; crisis; land-use;
   speculation; spatial effects
AB The 1997 economic crisis in Indonesia has a close relationship with the effects of globalisation as characterised by inflows of industrial and financial capital, originating from the global shift since the 1980s. In Jakarta especially, metropolitan expansion has witnessed substantial inflow of international capital into property-development activities. The crisis in Jakarta is characterised by a typical suburbanisation sprawl along development corridors extending beyond the scope of its Master Plan. Both the public and private sectors have been associated in the development programmes whereby a large number of new towns and industrial estates have been constructed. Adverse effects are obvious as a result of ineffective urban management and a lack in infrastructure and commitment to the planning principles. Jakarta's CBD expansion has also initiated the move of industries and low-income groups towards the peripheral zones. Consequently, the traditional urban villages face demolition, replaced by more lucrative and intensive land use. The kampung restructuring policy, once a symbol of social welfare, has virtually stopped to function under the impact of the globalisation and international capital. The high vulnerability of the speculative property market and its inherent urban problems question the sustainability of the Indonesian economic growth model. Educational upgrading, however, is seen as one of the fundamentals for supporting this model. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

DT Article
ID SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB This article analyzes the environmental degradation of the Argentine interior, emphasizing the roles played by different income groups. Argentina beyond the pampa is composed of fragile ecosystems that have been substantially degraded through decades or even centuries of overuse and abuse. This study ascertains the nature and extent of environmental degradation for each part of the interior, the relative importance of various income groups in agricultural production, and the differential tendency to degrade the environment of agriculturalists at different income levels. These variables are used to show that both the wealthy and the poor have played crucial roles in the environmental degradation of the Argentine interior.

SO LATIN AMERICAN RESEARCH REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
AB This article focuses on environmental protection issue networks (EPINs), defined here as networks among domestic and international environmentally concerned actors that seek to protect local environments. EPINs may be important agents in efforts to promote environmentally sustainable development in Latin America, but their effectiveness has varied considerably. The article presents a model for assessing the effectiveness of EPINs based on their strategic capacity, the environmental visibility of the issues with which they deal, and the nature of their opposition targets. The model was inspired by hypotheses generated in comparing three EPINs established to address environmental and social problems created by development projects financed by the World Bank in Brazilian Amazonia between 1981 and 2000.

TI Sustainability reference systems and indicators for responsible marine
   capture fisheries: a review of concepts and elements for a set of
   guidelines
SO MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB This review was prepared as a background document for the Consultation on Sustainable Indicators for Capture Fisheries held in Sydney, Australia, 18-22 January 1998. It aims to facilitate the development and implementation of indicators and to serve as a basis for the development of part of the series of Technical Guidelines in Support of the FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries. The paper reviews the concept of sustainable development ('sustainability'). Five sustainability frameworks are suggested for developing and grouping indicators. A discussion of the criteria that could be used to measure and monitor progress towards sustainability includes the types of possible indicators, their use within the sustainability concept, use of reference points on which to compare indicators and their relation to planning and management. Sustainable Development Reference Systems are introduced as a tool for grouping indicators and representing the interrelationships among them. Visual methods of portraying the human and environmental dimensions of sustainability and their indicators can be broadened to permit temporal and spatial comparisons. These, combined with systems to scale the different dimensions to reflect different societal values of their importance, can assist policy makers, fisheries managers, industries, non-governmental organizations and the general public in understanding and assessing progress towards sustainable development of capture fisheries.

AB This paper briefly reviews some of the progress made to address the issues of measuring sustainability since the Rio 'Earth Summit' in 1992. It provides the broader context within which to integrate indicators of fisheries sustainability. Although the immediate focus of fisheries indicators will be to achieve sustainability in the management of each fishery, it will also be necessary to aggregate some appropriate indicators geographically and temporally for global measures of fisheries sustainability. Conversely, global indicators of pressures on fisheries are needed as inputs to local sustainability calculations.

TI Indicators for assessing the sustainability of Australia's marine
   ecosystems
SO MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID COASTAL ZONE MANAGEMENT; SOCIETY; INDEX
AB Principles of integrated ecosystem-based management have been used to derive 61 potential environmental indicators for reporting on Australia's marine and estuarine ecosystems. They are focused on tracking the condition of marine ecosystems in the face of a variety of uses and pressures, and are consistent with approaches used for assessment of public- and private-sector environmental activities, and with the international standard. The indicators cover issues in protected species, common habitats, renewable and non-renewable resources, water and sediment quality, and integrated management. Gaps in knowledge and technical capacity include: knowledge of the nature of the ecosystems is incomplete (ineffective indicators may be selected); scientific understanding of environmental issues is limited (the wrong cause may be identified); the resolving capacity of a monitoring programme cannot be determined (monitoring may falsely infer that no changes have occurred, or provide an answer to the wrong question); procedures for synthesis and aggregation of data across spatial, temporal and taxonomic scales, or for estimating uncertainty in national summaries are lacking; case-study trials, reference sites, and suitable interpretative models are needed; and an established procedure for revising and updating the indicators as new knowledge accrues, or if new issues arise, is lacking.

TI Sustainable recruitment: the bottom line
SO MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH

DE stock-recruitment relationships; sustainability; concave regression
ID FISHERIES
AB This paper develops a single-species perspective on the limits of sustainable fishing. Given uncertain data and assessments, the problem is to determine lower confidence limits for the minimum fishing mortality rate F-tau that, if maintained indefinitely, would drive the stock to extinction. For non-depensatory stocks, F-tau is determined by the slope of the stock-recruitment curve at the origin. The paper reviews three different approaches to making inferences about F-tau: recruit-per-biomass relationships (e.g. F-high), parametric curves (e.g. Ricker), and nonparametric curves (e.g. LOWESS fits; Cook 1998). Of these, nonparametic curves are potentially the best, but existing implementations suffer from operational difficulties and do not always give biologically sensible fits. These problems can be circumvented by two new nonparametric methods, CONCR (Concave Recruitment) and DIMPOS (Diminishing returns, Positive recruitment), which are described and applied to several ICES stocks. Finally, the paper explores issues surrounding the use of sustainable recruitment measures in assessment and management.

AB There is a need to integrate indicators relating to complex human-nature systems. This paper discusses the scope and limitations of achieving such integration through the interim version of the system of integrated environmental and economic accounting (SEEA) published by the United Nations in 1993. It also briefly considers alternative or complementary approaches such as the National Accounting Matrix including Environmental Accounts (NAMEA) developed in the Netherlands. Issues that arise when applying SEEA to the marine fisheries sector are discussed, and examples are given of indicators for the marine fisheries sector derived from the SEEA and NAMEA.

The primary indicators of the impact of land-ocean interactions on marine capture fisheries are decentralized prices net of the effect of taxes and subsidies; these are the indicators that guide private use of watersheds, and estuarine and coastal systems.

AB Experience in the fisheries of the Bay of Bengal has demonstrated that a key factor in the sustainability of the resource is the involvement of whole communities. The degree to which this is achieved can be assessed with reference to signs such as the attitude of the resource users, the participation of the community in management, the relationship of fishers with money-lenders and market intermediaries, and a reduction in the degree of pollution deriving from the community. These can be used as indicators to monitor trends in the use of fisheries resources in this and similar regions.

SO MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH

DT Article
AB In 1988, FAO adopted its definition of sustainable development. In 1995 it adopted a Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries, which offers an integrated comprehensive framework for the sustainable development of fisheries and aquaculture. The paper analyses briefly the correspondence between the principles contained in the definition and the provisions contained in the Code. It shows that both texts represent a sustainability framework (with different degree of detail) and identifies the main criteria and indicators implicitly or explicitly called for in both the FAO definition and Code of Conduct.

TI Ageing, catch-at-age and relative year-class strength for snapper
   (Pagrus auratus) in northern Spencer Gulf, South Australia
SO MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH

DE otoliths; recruitment; catch and effort
ID REPRODUCTIVE-CYCLE; VALIDATION; SPARIDAE
AB Commercial landings of Pagrus auratus declined to 25-year lows in South Australia in 1994, and sustainability of the fishery was questioned. This study investigated two potential explanations for the decline - changes in fishing effort and recruitment variability. Data for 1983-97 from northern Spencer Gulf, which contributes the majority of snapper catches in the State, showed that 74% of the variance in targeted catch was explained by catch per unit effort, and 20% by fishing effort. Recruitment variability was examined by analysis of age structures of the commercial catch. An ageing procedure was established by examining sectioned sagittal otoliths of 1046 snapper caught in 1991 and 1994/5; their use was first evaluated by assessing the bias and precision of multiple readings and by comparing annulus counts with ring counts from scales. The timing of annulus formation was determined by marginal increment analysis. Interpretation of the age structures suggests that year-class strength is highly variable and has a strong influence on catch patterns in the commercial fishery. A qualitative comparison of temperature with year-class strength did not show a strong relationship.

TI The Malacca Straits
SO MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
LA English
DT Article
AB The Malacca Straits have long been an important trade route linking the Indian Ocean to the South China Sea and Pacific Ocean. From the seventh to the eleventh century, the Srivijaya empire controlled them, followed in the fifteenth century by the port kingdom of Malacca. Western maritime powers also recognized the strategic importance of the Straits, and in 1511, the Portuguese captured Malacca. In 1641, the Dutch occupied what is now known as Jakarta, and from the seventeenth to the eighteenth century, the Dutch East India company controlled the trade in the Straits (Ross et al,, 1995). The British also recognized the need to control the Straits to ensure the safe passage of British merchant ships on their way to China, and in 1819 established a colony in Singapore. In 1824, the British and the Dutch ended their rivalry with a treaty whereby Britain agreed to 'safeguard the Straits and keep them open for other friendly nations' (Chia, 1998).
   In recent years, the Straits have become a very important trade route. In 1993 and 1995, over 100 000 oil and cargo vessels traversed it each year, carrying 3.23 million barrels of crude oil through the Straits each day (Sakura Institute of Research, 1998), Shipping accidents have occurred more frequently, recently, which is attributed to heavy traffic in the Straits with shallow, narrow channels and shoals, Despite these hazards, economic efficiency dictates that vessels continue to use the Straits.
   The Straits are also rich in renewable and non-renewable resources, including productive coastal ecosystems, extensive capture fisheries, aquaculture, coastal tourism, mining and valuable natural gas reserves.
   This chapter looks at the natural environmental conditions and the status of the coastal resources, the sustainability of existing activities, critical environmental problems and management. It is based on the Malacca Straits Environmental Profile (Chua et al., 1997) and other studies undertaken by the GEF/UNDP/IMO Regional Programme for Marine Pollution Prevention and Management in the East Asian Seas, referred to as the Regional Programme in this document.

AB The global malaria situation has scarcely improved in the last 100 years, despite major advances in our knowledge of the basic biology, epidemiology and clinical basis of the disease. Effective malaria control, leading to a significant decrease in the morbidity and mortality attributable to malaria, will require a multidisciplinary approach. New tools - drugs, vaccine and insecticides - are needed but there is also much to be gained by better use of existing tools: using drugs in combination in order to slow the development of drug resistance; targeting resources to areas of greatest need; using geographic information systems to map the populations at risk and more sophisticated marketing techniques to distribute bed nets and insecticides. Sustainable malaria control may require the deployment of a highly effective vaccine, but there is much that can be done in the meantime to reduce the burden of disease.

AB The opportunities and challenges for the study and control of parasitic diseases in the 21st century are both exciting and daunting. Based on the contributions from this field over the last part of the 20th century, we should expect new biologic concepts will continue to come from this discipline to enrich the general area of biomedical research. The general nature of such a broad category of infections is difficult to distill, but they often depend on well-orchestrated, complex life cycles and they often involve chronic, relatively well-balanced host/parasite relationships. Such characteristics force biological systems to their limits, and this may be why studies of these diseases have made fundamental contributions to molecular biology, cell biology and immunology. However, if these findings are to continue apace, parasitologists must capitalize on the new findings being generated though genomics, bioinformatics, proteomics, and genetic manipulations of both host and parasite. Furthermore, they must do so based on sound biological insights and the use of hypothesis-driven studies of these complex systems. A major challenge over the next century will be to capitalize on these new findings and translate them into successful sustainable strategies for control, elimination and eradication of the parasitic diseases that pose major public health threats to the physical and cognitive development and health of so many people worldwide.

TI Pararetrovirus-crucifer interactions: attack and defence or modus
   vivendi?
SO MOLECULAR PLANT PATHOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB The compatible infection of plants by viruses usually leads to the development of systemic symptoms. Symptom expression of this kind is generally understood to be a host response that indicates an inability of the host to defend itself from attack. We have been studying compatible interactions between the plant pararetrovirus cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) and its crucifer hosts in order to understand the relationship between viral activity, symptom expression and plant defence. A CaMV protein (P6) appears to play a major role in eliciting symptom expression. This host response leads to a regulation of the viral multiplication cycle that is associated with leaf mosaics. The host regulation of CaMV appears to operate at the transcriptional level through an effect on the 35S promoter, or at the posttranscriptional level by a process that is akin to gene silencing, and can lead to host recovery depending upon the genetic background of the host. The plant apex is a focus for antiviral defence mechanisms, presumably because viral infection of the apical meristem would rapidly compromise the ability of the plant to generate new leaves and flowers for reproduction. The balance of interactions between CaMV and crucifers can provide a sustainable source of host plants to ensure viral propagation and viral exposure allows the host to adapt and develop its repertoire of defence mechanisms.

TI Remineralization for sustainable agriculture: A tropical perspective
   from a Brazilian viewpoint
SO NUTRIENT CYCLING IN AGROECOSYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
DE stonemeal; sustainable development; tropical agriculture
AB Current Latin American tropical agriculture is not sustainable. It has become dominantly large-scale, bringing irreversible environmental damages such as devastation of the flora and the fauna and soil-degradation for vast tracks of land. Instead of bonding man to the land, it is bringing unemployment and rural exit. Furthermore, a land management model has been developed with technology that has been transferred from countries with temperate soils without taking into account basic climatic, mineralogical, geochemical, ecological and cultural differences, which are present in our tropical ecosystem. One such technology has been the indiscriminate use of highly soluble NPK fertilizers. Under deep leached conditions, this strategy does not bring nutrient conservation. As an alternative, or as a support to those 'chemical' fertilizers, and as an important step towards sustainable development, we suggest the use of native-rocks (stone meal) as the ultimate way to restore to the leached tropical soils, a balanced inorganic compositionon which plant growth and biodiversity can thrive.

TI Incentive instruments for the sustainable use of marine resources
SO OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID COASTAL MANAGEMENT; AUSTRALIA; ISSUES; OCEAN
AB The Australian Government recently ratified the "Oceans Policy" which provides a policy framework to effectively manage the resources and uses of the Australian Exclusive Economic Zone. The Oceans Policy is to be implemented through Regional Marine Plans that are based on the notion of large marine ecosystems and have the objective to integrate sectoral commercial interests and conservation objectives. This paper makes a theoretical contribution to the development of Regional Marine Plans which will demand the specification of detailed policies for regulating the various marine uses and impacts in the respective marine regions. The paper discusses a wide range of policy instruments and exemplifies their potential role for the management of marine resources and uses. The term incentive instrument includes financial and economic instruments as well as legal and regulatory instruments, education, co-management, voluntary approaches, community-based mechanisms and research. A set of criteria is established for the evaluation of individual incentive instruments. They are further placed in the context of a series of principles for policy design. The paper explores potential management instruments to: improve water quality of streams, estuaries and oceans, create sustainable fisheries, ensure sustainable marine tourism and recreation, manage conflict between user and interest groups, ensure environmentally sound marine transport and petroleum exploration and mining.

TI The ocean and international environmental law: swimming, sinking, and
   treading water at the millennium
SO OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Various images help capture the status and trends of international law and policy efforts to protect the ocean environment. While "treading water" and "sinking" partly describe legal conditions at the millennium, this paper examines seven challenges in the international environmental law field which at the very least promise to make for a "hard swim" in coming decades. Those challenges include: coping with the proliferation of negotiated instruments; overcoming political opposition to environmental commitments; clarifying the jurisprudential underpinnings of international environmental law; sorting out the relation of environmental ethics, science and the rule of law; fleshing out the principles of sustainable development; addressing practical problems of implementing international responsibilities; and visioning future paths of ocean governance.

TI Third world states and fluid sovereignty: development options and the
   politics of sustainable ocean management
SO OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB As land resources become exhausted or less valuable, Third World states are integrating coastal and marine regions into their development strategies. Given current industrial practice, increased development in these regions have negative environmental consequences, and there is increasing pressure to address these. Third World states' management of their marine and coastal areas is shaped by factors such as fugitive resources, changing or indeterminate marine boundaries, economic vulnerability and evolving environmental regimes. These factors contribute to fluid sovereignty and affect states' ability to exercise authority, autonomy and control. This payer uses the case of the Wider Caribbean Region to illustrate that the net result of fluid sovereignty is diminished ability to sustainably manage ocean and coastal resources.

AB There is a fundamental shift in how the problems confronting a practicing coastal manager are being defined. Coastal zone management began as an expression of an environmental protection strategy and has evolved into a promising vehicle for progressing towards more sustainable forms of development, The contemporary practice of coastal management requires integrating within a curriculum a diverse mix of knowledge and skills that emphasize the two defining features of adaptive management. These are a governance process footed in the principles of participatory democracy and the application of the scientific principles that can produce reliable knowledge. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

ID SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB In the early 1990s, integrated coastal management (ICM) in the Mediterranean basin found general acceptance as an important issue both at national and international levels, and since then it has been, though slowly, steadily developed. Donor organizations such as the European Union and the World Bank, and the UNEP's Mediterranean Action Plan played catalyst roles in this development by initiating and supporting pilot projects. In 1992, the European Union launched the Mediterranean programs in which the environment, and especially the coastal environment, was considered as a priority issue. Parallel to this development, several NGO initiatives took place for public awareness on pressing coastal issues and in training and education. The idea of MEDCOAST, which is an NGO network of Euro-Mediterranean academic institutions, was born in 1990 and the new initiative was launched in two directions in 1993. One of these was the organization of the First International Conference on the Mediterranean Coastal Environment (2-5 November 1993, Antalya, Turkey), which placed strong emphasis on the management issues. The second was the development of a project proposal to the Med-Campus program of the European Union. The project, which had the title of Educational Programs in Coastal Zone Management, was selected for funding and became operational in early 1994. The first international training program organized by MEDCOAST was the MEDCOAST Institute 94: Coastal Zone Management in the Mediterranean. This three-week long training effort took place in August-September 1994. Since then, MEDCOAST organized eight training programs in by 1999 five different countries, which were participated by 173 professionals representing 31 countries. Development of an international Masters Degree program in ICM was the second goal of the MEDCOAST's Med-Campus project. Efforts for pursuing this goal are still continuing. This paper elaborates the potential for the NGO's contribution to training and education in the field of integrated coastal management in the Mediterranean and the Black Sea by introducing the MEDCOAST experience. Tt presents the past and planned MEDCOAST efforts and discusses the strengths and limitations of the role of NGOs at the regional scale. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Coastal and marine resource use conflicts and sustainable development in
   Tanzania
SO OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB A survey of coastal and marine resource use conflicts in Tanzania was carried out to highlight them, investigate their origin and finally, suggest ways of minimizing them. Although Tanzania is putting emphasis on environmental issues, including coastal zone management, integrated coastal area management has not yet been integrated into the government management structure/approach. Many conflicts are the result of sectoral approach to coastal and marine resources management, and improper or poor implementation of government policies. Additionally, the local coastal community, who are the foremost stakeholder, were most often not involved in the planning, decision and implementation of many projects and policies even those that affect them directly. Ignorance about the linkages of coastal and marine ecosystems and resources is also an important factor. I suggest that integrated coastal area management which is the foundation for sustainable development, as far as coastal and marine resources are concerned, should be integrated into the government administrative structure. A lead agency with full authority on all activities on the coastal area, including issuance of permits for environmental sensitive businesses/activities, should be nominated or established. This will reduce conflicts by bringing about national coordination of coastal area management. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Guidelines for developing and implementing sustainability indicators for marine capture fisheries were drafted during a recent expert consultation jointly organised by Australia and FAO in Sydney (Australia). This paper provides an overview of the guidelines and illustrates their application with an Australian example. As a background to the guidelines, the concept of sustainable development (SD) for marine capture fisheries was discussed and an agreed set of definitions and usage of common terms developed. The guidelines then outline the five sequential steps that need to be addressed in developing a meaningful set of indicators in the context of a Sustainable Development Reference System (SDRS). The five steps are:
   1. specifying the scope of the SDRS; 2. developing a framework to agree on components within the system; 3. specifying criteria, objectives, potential indicators and reference values; 4. choosing the set of indicators and reference values; 5. specifying the method of aggregation and visualisation.
   These steps are further elaborated in terms of how to scope the SDRS, define the dimensions and hierarchical levels to be included in the system, set multiple objectives and link these to indicators and reference values (e.g. targets, thresholds and/or standards). The guidelines also provide some examples of possible indicators, criteria for selecting some indicators over others and present ways of aggregating and visualising the indicators so that progress towards achieving sustainable development can be communicated easily to decision-makers.

TI Group farming for sustainable aquaculture
SO OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Sustainable farming is a critical issue in aquaculture development. The concept is well understood but the issue is that of methodology for implementing it. It is well recognized that fragmented holdings have been a major constraint in the implementation of farming practices by small-scale farmers. In India 80 per cent of the shrimp production comes from small and marginal holdings which follow different systems of production, including the traditional. 'pokkali' farms of Kerala state, improved traditional farming, and scientific methods. Group farming, which was highly successful in paddy farming, was tested among small-scale shrimp farmers practicing paddy and shrimp farming in rotation in a cluster of 'pokkali' fields in Kerala. The model served as an effective extension intervention to educate farmers on sustainability while helping them to improve their farming practices. The farmers, including women, could be equipped with the technology for farming not only shrimp but also finfish, crab and aquaculture feed production by strengthening the farmer-extensionist-researcher-political-administrative linkages. The work was done during 1993-1996 at the Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute, Cochin, India. The study formed a part of the action research project on empowerment of rural communities through extension. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The spread of exotic Spartina anglica (rice grass) occurs in temperate estuaries of the USA, UK, Netherlands, France, China, New Zealand and Australia. In Australia S. anglica infestations are found in the southern States of Tasmania and Victoria. The ecological, social and economic costs associated with its continued spread in Tasmania have resulted in the development of a management program supporting eradication and control. The paper begins by outlining the suite of problems associated with the management of exotic S. anglica infestations. The legislative framework for S. anglica is then critically evaluated. Recent developments that Facilitate integrated coastal zone management are presented and assessed with respect to S. anglica. The paper makes recommendations on resolving legislative and institutional responsibility, promoting sustainable development practices in the coastal zone and raising the profile of environmental and aquatic weeds such as S. anglica.

TI Regional marine environmental management and the GPA-LBA: perspectives
   and the need for scientific support
SO OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Enclosed and semi-closed seas are suffering due to an increase of discharges and emissions of polluting substances. Regional and subregional cooperation is crucial for the development and implementation of successful actions aiming at protecting and managing the marine environment as well as in identification of priorities for action. In spite of good will, the implementation of agreed programmes is in most cases a very slow process. Even in regions, where scientific knowledge is remarkable, and political commitment has been shown in ministerial meetings and declarations, the targets set in those meetings are very seldom achieved in the agreed time-table. We have high-level decisions on ocean-related issues, which are far behind the schedule in the implementation. To facilitate decision-making it is necessary to provide clear information based on comprehensive programmes, long lasting and large enough to meet the demands far beyond the own political career of the decision makers concerned. In the implementation of the GPA, the regional-seas approach and results of the existing conventions and action plans are fundamental. There are problems related to living marine resources, where scientific understanding of how the oceans and seas interact with the world climate system, and how the changes are affecting the marine ecosystems. In addition to the active regional cooperation in marine environmental issues, there is a need for global activities, joint responsibility to solve problems together. The UN Commission of Sustainable Development (CSD) considered ocean issues in 1999 calling upon the governments to strengthen national, regional and international action, and to develop integrated approaches to oceans and coastal area management. The CSD identified areas of particular concern, including problems related to marine resources, land-based pollution and marine science and emphasized that scientific understanding of the marine environment is fundamental to sound decision-making. Different UN organizations and programmes were invited to consider, how to support building of scientific capacities, needed for interdisciplinary, sustainable and effective management of the marine: environment. The new cooperation PACSICOM (Panafrican Conference on Sustainable Integrated Coastal Management) is one of the first attempts to streamline coastal management on a Continental basis based on scientific knowledge. It is also an attempt to strengthen the national and regional measures already going on. It may pave the way to rise the public awareness and it may lead to implementation to conserve at least part of Africa's coastal nature. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. Ail rights reserved.

SO OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT

ID SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB The coastal zones are home to almost 60% of the people worldwide. The land-water interface at the coast results in high fish productivity. Industrialization has resulted in the creation of urban agglomerations on the coast primarily because of facilitation of trade by way of sea. Environmental problems resulting from industrialization and urbanization have had disastrous effect on the coastal ecology and on the socio-economic status of a number of coastal communities. The concept of "integrated coastal management" is central to the management of coastal zones and ocean areas under national jurisdiction in Chapter 17 of the Agenda 21. adopted at the UNCED in 1992. For this to be effective, coastal zone communities have to be involved, and this will be sustainable only if their socio-economic conditions are improved. This payer reports on one such attempt made in India where a global NGO is working along with a local NGO to improve the socio-economic as well as environmental conditions of a part of the east coast of India. The focus has been on achieving economic security by creating new avenues for employment and using micro-credit schemes as a forerunner for environmental protection activities.

TI Environmental and social impacts of management approaches in Sevastopol
   Bay in a historic retrospective: a case study from the Black Sea
SO OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB The article is aimed at discussion and comparison of ecosystems succession and landscapes transformation through influences of management approaches that were applied in the Sevastopol Bay Region (SBR), by several cultural traditions of different civilisations governing the territory in various times till present. These management consequences and possible solutions for the implementation of the sustainability principle in the development of the territory as civil and economically independent one, aimed at achieving non-destructive longlasting anthropogenic transformations in coastal environments, were paid special attention. The article is focused on comparison of consequences of different models of management applied in SBR in various times. In this article is also a proposed list of helpful actions to be applied here. Also given is a description of an early industrial society management model with analysis of its difference from the late industrial society coastal zone management model, now commonly used all over the world as a method for obtaining sustainability in coastal zone. These societies have principally different structure of investments, sources of economical growth and social priorities not speaking about their public opinions, Principal differences in management models real for early and late periods of industrialisation are analysed taking into account that in general nature/environmental management could be effective only in democratic societies, but the set of management methods in these two cases must be principally different. The difference between these two options is mainly the difference in their social priorities and is treated as a key point for development of management strategies for certain regions/ecosystems to be effective and not only to declare some conservation/recovery efforts to perform, In other words coastal management is shown to be an extremely "socially sensitive" field of applied science, especially in developing societies. Creation and importance of special educational programmes/bodies for the implementation of management efforts and increasing of public and governmental awareness, is discussed.

TI Coastal environment assessment procedure for sustainable wastewater
   management in tropical islands: the Mayotte example
SO OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB The recent evolution of the coastal environment is characterized by an increase of human potential impacts: coastal zone is located at the cross-road of sectoral issues which give rise to a number of often competing uses. Today, the main challenges in the coastal environment management are not derived from "technical problems" but correspond to the global coastal management and to the means to harmonize the different uses. This new approach has generated the need to apply systemic concepts which are able to describe and analyze large and complex systems. In the coastal zone - and especially in sensitive environments such as tropical island surrounded by coral reefs, lagoons or boat channels - one of the major challenges is to conciliate the waste waters and pipe outfalls management and the ecological preservation. The paper presents the results which have been obtained with a global approach for the definition of a sustainable wastewater management strategy in highly sensitive coastal areas located in Mayotte, (Comoros archip, Indian Ocean). This example allows to explain and identify the necessary tools and essential procedures as hydrodynamic modelling or public participation. From this application, a procedure for a coastal environment assessment procedure is formulated and proposed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A new millennium offers an opportunity to think about possible future directions in ocean policy. But such an effort must take account of the considerable changes in the world political and economic system since 1989-globalization with its rapid transportation, communication, economic interdependence; population increase, increased pressure on the stock of the world's natural resources and spaces, the end of the Cold War but with diffusion of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, and a rise in world environmental consciousness. In this context we must develop patterns of sustainable use, and learn how to implement forward look principles for ocean management such as those propounded by the Luso-American Foundation. However, we have nor calculated the political and economic costs or understood how we will achieve outcomes consistent with the principles. These are critical to successful global ocean governance. We understand what must be achieved but not by whom or how.

AB An Internet service provider is examined, along with the factors that should be considered when entering the ISP market The global Internet scenario is discussed regarding the phases of the Internet in India, i.e. pre and post commercialisation. The main players are described: ERNET, NICNET, STPI, VSNL, MTNL, Satyam Infoway and Bharti-BT. The financial and legal implications are highlighted in the Indian context. Many companies entered the nascent ISP business in India due to deregulation. Building local content, foreknowledge of new Internet technologies, connecting issues, competitiveness, etc, would help in their sustainability.

Questions are raised about this, based on the observation of a day in each of the lives of two headquarters managers at Greenpeace, the Executive Director and a Director of certain of the central units. In our analysis, we look beyond the obvious doing and the obvious planning, beyond the obvious acting and the obvious politicking.

DT Article
DE African elephants; agriculture; conflict; land use
ID LARGE MAMMALS; PEOPLE
AB The future persistence of African elephants over the 80 per cent of the species's range that remains outside protected areas is increasingly uncertain in many parts of the continent. Conflict between elephants and agriculturalists is already widespread and can lead to displacement or elimination of elephants, causing a further decline in their range and numbers. 'Protectionist' conservation groups have recently attempted to play down the importance of human-elephant conflict, contending that it has been greatly exaggerated by those advocating sustainable use of wildlife. The future of elephants in ecosystems over much of the continent will depend largely upon the attitudes and activities of humans. The realities of survival faced by rural Africans may mean that little attention will be paid to a debate taking place on conservation philosophy in the developed world. Therefore, the IUCN African Elephant Specialist Group (AfESG) is investigating how human land use can be integrated with the needs of elephant populations in Africa's biogeographical regions. Findings from these studies will be used in attempts to benefit elephant conservation and management in the 37 African elephant range states.

ID INFORMATION; ARRIVAL
AB The Asian economic crisis brought the institutional framework within which markets operate in this region under scrutiny. This gave rise to a broad consensus that both recovery and more sustainable markets require major governance reform, not the least being a shift towards more transparency. Adequate, timely and reliable information was portrayed as a major factor in the crisis, preventing informed investment decisions and contributing to a dramatic loss of business confidence. But what does this imply for authoritarian controls over the media? Are they a likely casualty as the objective needs of markets now assert themselves? In this study, we examine one of the most advanced economies in the region where transparency and media freedom have been markedly absent. Yet the city-state's policy-makers have responded to the crisis by forcefully promoting Singapore as an international finance centre - wherein a free flow of information is thought to be critical. The rhetoric of transparency, and even some reforms in that direction, has been adopted. However, neither a free media nor political openness is part of the government's agenda. To date, this selective approach certainly does not appear to have deterred investment. This not only suggests that the People's Action Party's brand of authoritarianism is durable, but that the institutional frameworks within which advanced capitalism can operate remain varied.

DT Article
DE employee development; personal development; workplace learning; human
   resource development; democracy; regulations
AB The article explores the growth of EDAP-style employee led development (ELD) schemes in the 1990s and critically appraises the arguments offered in their support The dominant claims for ELD sit with equal comfort in the discourse of trade unionists promoting "bargaining for skills" and managerialists promoting populist notions of the "learning company": However the article draws on recent research which suggests that ELD is better understood as a marginal addition to the effort-reward bargain; a "fringe benefit": a "way of giving something back" in a period characterised by an intensification of effort, upheaval and uncertainty. Its contribution, therefore, to the emergence of sustainable human resource development is minimal - at least in conventional terms. Through the exposition of two case studies a reformulated argument is offered which seeks to place ELD in a framework of theory and practice which is both more durable and liberating The article concludes that the ability to make and act upon an informed and rational interpretation of one's interests, as an individual or as a member of a collective within the workplace, must surely be premised on the development of an ongoing educational process; a process toward which a reformulated notion of ELD may well contribute.

AB The main objective of this research was to test the hypothesis of whether family agriculture, as defined herewith, would indeed be predominant in the Taquara Branca watershed, in the State of Sao Paulo, Brazil, site of a larger sustainable development assessment study. Data on 33 of 106 landholdings in the watershed were obtained by directly applied cross-section questionnaires. The variables for multivariate analysis were first selected through a unidimensional analysis, when some questions were selected with basis on answer variability. Multivariate statistics was used (PROC CLUSTER, SAS) to define and analyze the groupings. Twenty two respondents (out of the 33) were involved in agricultural activities, comprising, then, the universe of the study. Cluster analysis allowed the identification of three natural groups among the 22 landholdings. It was possible to classify each group, according to their characteristics, as follows: group 1 - twelve typical family landholdings; group 2 - six non-family, small landholdings; and group 3 - four non-family, large landholdings. Although not predominant in terms of area, typical family agriculture was found to be the more frequent (36%) in the watershed.

AB In the arid areas of the European Union there exist locations in which there is scarcity of water relative to the demand and the water demand has substantial temporal variations, rising during the summer many times over the annual average. Locales where such conditions exist are found primarily, but not exclusively, in the Mediterranean basin. Where water resources are limited relatives to demand, their sustainable management is the instrument through which economic growth can be attained, with due regard for protection of the environment. The proposed alternative to traditional water supply modes consists in desalinating brackish groundwater, instead of seawater, coupled with an effective strategy for controlling saltwater intrusion that enhances the hydrologic budget through reuse of wastewater. The economic viability of this approach is to be examined. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Major problems are experienced in South Africa due to the invasion of non-indigenous or alien species of terrestrial plants in several catchments. Alien invaders are estimated to use approximately 6,7% of the estimated mean annual runoff of water over the entire area of South Africa and as high as 15,8% in the Western Cape Province. The impacts are significantly higher, on a percentage basis, during drought periods as the riparian invaders still have free access to water. Rural and urban communities with limited storage capacities for water supply that depend on the flow of water in the river are particularly affected by the reduced flow of water. The invasion of alien plants in catchments is influencing the total water resources system and affecting all sectors. The nature and extent of invasive alien plants, the effects thereof on available water resources, the threat to ecological environment and impacts on society, need to be understood to ensure the success of the integrated approach to control the spread of invasive alien plants. If properly managed, the programmes to control invasive alien plants can provide the stimulus needed for an active participatory approach in integrated management of catchments in South Africa to deal with water scarcity and to ensure sustainability of the environment, land use and water.

AB The paper clarifies the differences between the criteria of managing-water as a scarce resource, since it is likely that the planner confuses these criteria. These criteria include economic efficiency, cost recovery, fairness, effectiveness, and sustainability. Reference is made to the case of Egypt where water scarcity is imminent, thus water demand management (WDM) is needed. The paper shows that, to manage a scarce resource like water, the economic allocative efficiency can be a criterion to start with. The economic allocative efficiency can be improved by allocating certain water quotas to certain users. Determining these quotas can be a first step of WDM. The second step can be to work out a strategy for implementing these quotas. This strategy can be a combination of taxes (negative incentives), subsidies (positive incentives), enforcement (regulations), and technology changes. The preferred combination can be the one that scores best at criteria like implementation cost, fairness, and sustainability. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The Portland Aluminium smelter, located near the town of Portland, Australia, currently discharges over 715 ML of wastewater into the ocean each year. As an alternative to ocean discharge, Portland Aluminium has constructed a number of trial evaporation ponds to receive this wastewater. These ponds must not only be efficient evaporative pans, they must not pollute nearby wetlands, and also be aesthetically pleasing. Hence, water quality is a major issue. In this study, a comparison was made between the concentrations of fluoride (F-), sulphate (SO42-), sodium (Na+, potassium (K+), calcium (Ca2+), magnesium (Mg2+), and chloride (Cl-) ions in the ponds. Our results show that there was a correlated increase in fluoride, sodium, potassium, chloride, magnesium and sulphate concentrations in April and May 1998 in the constructed ponds, followed by a significant reduction in ion concentration by July 1998 (p < 0.001). Calcium ion was the only ionic species to not behave in this manner. Statistically there was no significant change in calcium concentration over time in the constructed ponds (p > 0.05).

AB The sustainable use of wetlands and water resources requires management approaches that incorporate explicitly the spatial and temporal interconnections among different aquatic ecosystems. Current management practices, on the contrary, are characterised by conceptual, thematic and spatial divisions generated by the same fragmented worldview behind non-sustainable growth. Here we identify several shortcomings in the current management of European wetlands. These stem from the contradiction implicit in the creation of highly protected 'natural' reserves surrounded by unprotected 'non-natural' territory. We will illustrate the consequences of this policy for the management of certain Mediterranean watersheds containing SPAs, SACs or Ramsar sites - in particular the Guadalquivir and Guadiana watersheds, which respectively include the Donana and Tablas de Daimiel nature reserves. To exemplify these points, we also analyse the degree of integration of the multiple directives and regulations affecting the European wetlands policy. Finally, we propose future avenues for improved institutional cooperation aimed at catalysing the emergence of a spatially-integrated, but regionally-diverse approach for water management.

AB Physiological changes in roots in response to tropospheric ozone can lead to altered below-ground processes, and responses are not always predictable due to the complexity of the belowground ecosystem. Previous experiments have shown that ozone reduces carbon allocation to roots and mycorrhizal hyphae, and reduces root starch in ponderosa pine. Ozone was found to increase CO2 flux from soils containing ponderosa pine seedlings in controlled exposures, a response seemingly inconsistent with results showing decreased allocation to roots. We hypothesize this apparent paradox is due to a combination of factors including altered root metabolism and increased soil microbial respiration. Increased microbial respiration is hypothesized to result from increased root exudation, which was observed in trials with wheat, and possibly increased root mortality and turnover. Increased microbial respiration was supported by findings of increased bacterial and fungal populations in soil of plants exposed to ozone. Responses are expected to be short term, since chronic ozone exposure would lead to lower standing root biomass over time and decreased CO2 flux from soil.
   Changes in carbon allocation to roots and mycorrhizae, reduced root growth, and altered carbon release to soil are all important factors that affect carbon fluxes into and out of forested ecosystems. The dependence of the soil organisms on carbon substrates from plants illustrates the potentially important role that ozone may play in altering ecosystem carbon fluxes. Ozone may alter nutrient availability, soil moisture holding capacity, and ultimately plant productivity through indirect effects on soil chemical and physical characteristics. Studies are currently underway in naturally regenerated stands of ponderosa pine to better understand how natural and anthropogenic stresses such as ozone affect roots and soil processes, and how changes occurring below-ground affect ecosystem productivity and sustainability.

DT Article
AB Hedeoma multiflorum Bentham (Lamiaceae) is a native aromatic-medicinal species which is under pressure with severe regression of its populations, due to extensive and indiscriminate extraction for commercial purposes. This work studies the germination of this species under laboratory conditions in order to gather data for its commercial cultivation. Seeds from plants of the San Luis sierras were collected during 1994, 1995 and 1996 and stored in airtight containers. Their germination energy was determined on the 3(rd) day of germination and their germination power on the 7(th) day. The results show that the seed goes through a state of primary rest which ends six months after harvest, when germination energy and power reach maximum values. Beyond one year of age, those values decrease significantly.

AB The present work had the objective of raising plants of "peperina de las lomas", from seeds, in experimental plots, under mountain conditions, to gather information about requirements of the species for use in its commercial cultivation. The results, after repeating the test for three years, show that plants complete a life cycle and then die, i.e, they behave like annuals (in nature they are perennials) may be due to intraspecific competition (higher plant density under cultivation than that observed in the wild populations of the area). The growth reached by the plants, expressed as total length of the aerial part, surpassed that of those that grow wild; and the average production of 1430 g was fresh matter /m(2) and 17,468 of dry matter. In winter, the plants have withstood 10 degrees C without shedding leaves.

AB The most commonly observed change in soil following slash-and-burn clearing of tropical forest is a short-term increase in nutrient availability. Studies of shifting cultivation commonly cite the incorporation of nutrient-rich ash from consumed aboveground biomass into soil as the reason for this change. The effects of soil heating on nutrient availability have been examined only rarely in field studies of slash-and-burn, and soil heating as a mechanism of nutrient release is most often assumed to be of minor importance in the field. Few budgets for above and belowground nutrient flux have been developed in the tropics, and a survey of results from field and laboratory studies indicates that soils are sufficiently heated during most slash-and-burn events, particularly in dry and monsoonal climates, to cause significant, even substantial release of nutrients from non-plant-available into plant-available forms in soil. Conversely, large aboveground losses of nutrients during and after burning often result in low quantities of nutrients that are released to soil. Assessing the biophysical sustainability of an agricultural practice requires detailed information about nutrient flux and loss incurred during management. To this end, current conceptual models of shifting cultivation should be revised to more accurately describe these fluxes and losses.

AB Two pre-established agricultural field trials were assessed for the abundance of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) in the soil (density of spores, species richness and lengths of extra-radical mycelium [ERM]) in association with one of three tropical plant species (Gliricidia sepium, Peltophorum dasyrachis and Zea mays). The trials were managed by one of three agricultural practices: soil disturbance in a monoculture system, a root barrier to prevent interactions between plants in an agroforestry system or the addition of organic matter (OM) in an agroforestry and a monoculture system. The lengths of ERM of AMF in the soil were greater in the agroforestry system than the monoculture system. These were greater when a root barrier was present, but decreased when OM was added. Soil disturbance reduced the density of spores, species richness and the lengths of ERM of AMF compared with the undisturbed soil. This work indicates that agricultural trials may provide a useful tool to monitor the abundance of AMF in the field. Clearly, there is potential to increase the abundance of AMF, from different genera, in the soil through the management of agricultural practices. The significance of the abundance of AMF for subsequent benefits to plant growth and development and ultimately the sustainability of tropical agro-ecosystems are discussed.

AB The research is focused on an ecologically sound and highly productive cultivation system for fodder and/or biomass for thermal power generation on the basis of winter legumes and maize as subsequent summer crop, managed without additional nitrogen fertiliser. Therefore the yield of biomass and N-fixing capacity of a winter pea (Pisum sativum L.) and crimson clover (Trifolium incarnatum L.) monocropped and intercropped with rye (Secale cereale L.) were examined for five years in a field trial. In mid-June above-ground biomass of winter crops was removed and maize transplanted. The winter crops achieved maximum dry matter yield about three to five weeks before maturity. Mixed stands yielded more biomass than pure stands and exhibited greater yield stability. The relative advantage of intercropping, expressed as land equivalent ratio (LER), determined for intercropped winter pea/rye were 1.1 to 1.2 and for crimson clover/rye 1.3. At maturity, the amount of fixed nitrogen ranged between 178 kg N for crimson clover and 242 kg N ha(-1) for winter pea, respectively. At the end of anthesis (middle of June, harvesting stage for silage fodder) 75% and 88% of the total fixed nitrogen was achieved, for clover and pea, respectively. In intercropping the amount of fixed nitrogen was lower than in pure stands due to a lower seed density of the legume; however, the N-fixing efficiency was greater than in pure stands. N-release of the winter pea in a pure stand produced a maximum yield in maize (Zea mays L.) without additional N-fertiliser. An additional N mineral fertilisation of 75 to 150 kg N and 75 to 225 kg N was necessary to achieve maximum yields in maize following intercropped winter pea and crimson clover, respectively. Legumes in mixed stands with rye resulted in lower amounts of residual nitrogen after maize harvest. The beneficial effect of legumes on maize can be divided into N-effects and rotation effects. Both effects were positive regarding winter pea. The rotation effect of crimson clover in pure stands on maize was negative. Allelopathic effects and the high sensitivity of crimson clover to mineral nitrogen in the soil, released by residues of the preceding crop, winter rape (Brassica rapa L.), were discussed as the reason for this observation. The combination of the winter pea in pure stand and maize achieved the highest total biomass yield from winter and summer crops, unfertilised (156 dt ha(-1) dry). The combinations of intercropped legumes and maize produced biomass yields of 142 to 145 dt ha(-1). Because winter pea is highly susceptible to lodging, intercropping with low seed density of rye is recommended (3/4 winter pea, 1/4 rye). The rye crop prevents lodging by providing support and high rates of N-fixation are achieved with high seed density of pea. lntercropping with crimson clover and rye should be based on high seed densities of legumes, too because rye is highly competitive within those mixtures.

AB Reindeer/caribou (Rangifer tarandus) constitute a biological resource of vital importance to the physical and cultural survival of Arctic residents since time immemorial, Recent and possible future economic, social and ecological changes raise concern for sustainability of these resources and the well-being of those who depend on them. In February 1999 eighty scientists, reindeer/caribou users and resource managers gathered in Rovaniemi, Finland, for an interdisciplinary workshop to develop a circumpolar research plan that addressed the sustainability of human-reindeer/caribou systems. Small working groups addressed six themes: hunting systems, herding systems, rangeland/habitat protection, minimizing industrial impacts, maintaining the strength of indigenous cultures, and responding to global change. The resulting Research Plan calls for interdisciplinary comparative studies, advancement: of tools for assessing cumulative effects, implementation of regional and a circumpolar monitoring and assessment programmes, and cultural studies on the transmission of knowledge. Cross-cuttings directives for future research include:
   improving humans' ability to anticipate and respond to change;
   understanding better the dynamics of human-reindeer/caribou systems;
   developing research methods that are both more instructive and less intrusive;
   facilitating open communication among groups with interests in reindeer/caribou resources;
   organizing researchers into a strong, coordinated network;
   re-framing the conventional research paradigm to be more inclusive of differing cultural perspectives.
   Three follow-up initiatives are proposed: 1) development of a web-based resource on the human role in reindeer/caribou systems (www.rangifer.net); 2) establishment of a Profile of Herds database to support comparative research; and 3) convening of working groups to address specific problems identified by workshop participants.

AB The resilience of tundra ecosystems is limited, with relatively few key biotic components determining the general pattern of the dynamics of these systems. Sustainable use of reindeer pastures, which are natural tundra ecosystems, should take into account interactions within the whole complex of key components. Among the most important are the small herbivorous rodents. For example, during peak densities lemmings may reduce above-ground plant biomass by 50-70%. At the same time, rapid turnover of nutrients in the form of significant amounts of potassium, phosphorus and nitrogen that lemmings excrete in urine promotes vascular plant growth. It is concluded that these kinds of studies are essential for the sustainable management of Russia's grazing lands: 1) comparative studies of productivity, biological diversity and structure of plant communities under the different pressures exerted by the main groups of herbivorous animals (reindeer and small rodents), as well as under varying levels of industrial development; 2) studies of the direct and indirect effects of herbivorous mammals on biological turnover and energy flow within the system; 3) studies of the role of industrial contamination on the turnover of nutrients in tundra ecosystems.

CY FEB 10-14, 1999
CL ROVANICMI, FINLAND
AB The importance of migratory caribou (Rangifer tarandus) to northerners, the increasing pressure to extract non-living resources, and predicted global climate change have led researchers, managers and resource users alike to focus on how to improve our knowledge of this unique northern ungulate. Unprecedented threats to caribou sustainability, along with the increasingly acknowledged value of indigenous hunters' contribution to caribou research, pose the additional challenge to innovate research methods that accommodate differing cultural perspectives and facilitate communication among groups. This paper surveys the state of scientific knowledge of the eleven major northern mainland herds of North America. We recommend an approach to improve our working knowledge of barren-ground caribou in order to assess better future impacts. The transfer of knowledge gained from years of research and indigenous experience on many aspects of caribou ecology should be evaluated and, where applicable, transferred to herds with more modest databases. The establishment of a North American Caribou Monitoring and Assessment System, based on a synthesis of local knowledge and research-based science, is recommended as a tool for improved communication and collective learning.

SO POLICY SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
AB An important current of research in international environmental affairs deals with the roles of non-state actors in international environmental governance. For many, the growing influence of non-state actors is a welcome trend because these actors, especially non-governmental organizations, facilitate environmental negotiations between states and perform key information-gathering, dissemination, advocacy, and appraisal functions that states are either unwilling or unable to do. For the student of international relations (IR), examining the roles and responsibilities of non-state actors in global environmental affairs is a departure from the ordinary concern of that field - namely, the study of interstate behavior. But for the study of global environmental problems, particularly those problems that are simultaneously global and local, the investigator must map the influence of an even broader assemblage of actors. Little is known about how local level institutions or ordinary citizens fit into global environmental policy processes. Understanding what motivates public demands for global environmental quality is an especially important research task, especially for those pervasive environmental problems like global climate change and complex exhortations like sustainable development that require the attention and acquiescence of ordinary citizens.

AB In an effort to add to our understanding of why government chooses to take actions in certain situations and not others, this article applies competing theories of agenda building to a specific environmental issue, forest policymaking in British Columbia (BC), Canada. Clearly, how well BC and the rest of Canadian provinces manage their forests and other natural resources will contribute to the ability of Canada ar a whole to become a sustainable society. In the 1990s the BC government enacted the Forest Practices Code, a comprehensive approach to managing the province's forests. This study relies on several different theoretical approaches to explain how such an ambitious program war developed and implemented. How difficult and complex environmental issues manage to reach the political agenda is crucial to our understanding of policy change and is addressed in this study.

AB This article examines the attempt by the Canadian Federal Government to pass endangered species legislation (1995). It focuses on the constraints which confront the creation of environmental policy in Canada and identifies jurisdictional overlap and stakeholder conflict ar the prime source of difficulties which confronted the Federal Government as it moved through the policy process for creating endangered species legislation. The wide-ranging consultation process leading up to the creation of the legislation provided ample opportunity for powerful interests to undermine the protection of endangered species. The article concludes with a discussion of endangered species legislation ar an example of the failure of the "crisis management'" approach to conservation and sustainability.

TI Policy design and the acceptability of environmental risks: Nuclear
   waste disposal in Canada and the United States
SO POLICY STUDIES JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
ID PERCEIVED RISK; TRUST
AB This article examines the controversial process of developing high-level nuclear waste disposal policy in Canada, with some comparison to experience in the United States. It argues that a policy design perspective can assist in understanding the difficult social and political issues associated with waste disposal and the environmental and health risks that it poses. I examine several critical questions related to such an endeavor and link them to long-term goals of building a sustainable society. Success in formulating and implementing a nuclear waste policy in Canada will depend on the nation's capacity to create requisite processes of public participation. Particularly important are those actions that can help the public understand and assess environmental risks. including related ethical and social issues, and build public trust and confidence in the siting processes and the implementing agencies.

TI Canadian foreign policy and straddling stocks: Sustainability in an
   interdependent world
SO POLICY STUDIES JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
ID ATLANTIC
AB Canada cannot manage straddling fish stocks, which extend beyond Canadian waters into the high seas,without an effective-foreign fisheries policy. This article examines the politics and fate of two such stocks in the Northwest Atlanlic: cod and Greenland halibut. More successful management of straddling stocks, I argue, can be achieved if enforcement policies ore conducted within the framework of multilateral fisheries organizations. By appealing to the rules and information provided by these institutions, Canadian governments can pursue more aggressive and proactive fisheries policies while maintaining a high level of political support at home and abroad.

AB Both Taiwan and Mexico have experienced remarkable economic growth since the 1960s. Taiwan demonstrates that higher income level can be accompanied by falling income inequalities. However, unlike Taiwan, the course of economic growth in Mexico has left the country with a very unequal distribution of income. This paper compares the government policies of income distribution in Mexico and Taiwan and identifies the factors contributing to the success of Taiwan and to the highly uneven income distribution in Mexico. The paper concludes that market-oriented growth does nor automatically reduce inequality or poverty. The prospects for better income equity and sustainable economic development would be greatly enhanced through implementation of policies aimed at redistributing land and skills, facilitating small enterprises, and increasing domestic saving.

DT Article
AB This article constructs framework for policy-oriented a conceptual and normative discussions of environmental uncertainty and risk. Human-caused environmental risks me unavoidable in a technologically cmd economically advanced society. Contemporary environmentalists deploy ecological and ethical axioms to structure the debate over environmental uncertainty and risk management. They adopt the "imperative of sustainability" and the "precautionary principle" as the foci of an ethical and ecological effort to evaluate and limit environmental risk. The policy implications of these axioms for those engaged in environmental risk and cost/benefit analysis are explored.

TI Strategic environmental planning and uncertainty: A cross-national
   comparison of green plans in industrialized countries
SO POLICY STUDIES JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB Uncertainty is a distinct feature of environmental policy and environmental issues. This article explores the potential of strategic and comprehensive environmental planning for dealing with these uncertainties. First, four types of uncertainty and their specific impacts on environmental policy are distinguished. Strategic environmental planning could be a promising approach for dealing with these uncertainties. Bared on an empirical analysis of national environmental policy plans and sustainability strategies in Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries, this article comes to the conclusion that although only few of the existing green plans fully explore the theoretical potential of this new approach to environmental policymaking, it Iras proven an effective mechanism to deal with and reduce at least some of the uncertainties with which environmental policymakers are confronted. The greatest potential of strategic planning lies in increasing the political system's capacity to deal with those problems of long-term environmental degradation, which in spite of the past successes of environmental protection remain largely unsolved.

SP Glaxo Welcome
AB We are in a period of reconsideration and revision of international ethical guidelines for the conduct of biomedical research involving human subjects. The proximate cause of much of this activity is the recent controversy over the ethics of the use of a placebo control in the clinical trials of the short-duration regimen of zidovudine for prevention of perinatal transmission of HIV infection, trials that were carried out in several so-called technologically developing countries. Critics of these trials claimed that they were in violation of Article II.3 of the Declaration of Helsinki., which states: "In any medical study, every patient-including those of a control group, if any-should be assured of the best proven diagnostic and therapeutic method. This does not exclude the use of inert placebo in studies where no proven diagnostic or therapeutic method exists." The critics claimed that since the "best proven... method" is the 076 regimen, this is what must be provided to members of the control groups. Failure to do so, they asserted, was a serious breach of ethics. In response to this allegation, several major international and national agencies convened multidisciplinary groups to consider the ethics of multinational clinical research. The first thing they realized was that Article II.3 was in error in that it did not reflect contemporary ethical thinking. Moreover, it was routinely violated in research conducted in developed as well as in developing countries. What replaces this standard? The 1993 CIOMS International Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical Research Involving Human Subjects include several criteria for justification of research carried out in developing countries. Most importantly, the research must be responsive to the health needs and priorities of the host country. They also require that any therapeutic products developed in such research must be made "reasonably available" to residents of the host country. A new standard is emerging for selecting therapies to be administered to participants in multinational clinical trials and for use as the control "treatment" in such trials. It is called the "highest attainable and sustainable" therapeutic method. Application of this standard differs from application of the "best proven method" standard in that it permits the evaluation of new therapies that are responsive to the health needs and priorities of resource-poor countries. It has long been recognized that the Declaration of Helsinki is a flawed document in that it relies on the illogical distinction between therapeutic and nontherapeutic research. This distinction has been removed from the most recent draft revisions of the Helsinki and the CIOMS documents.

AB The demands for energy are increasing as countries become richer, and if all mankind achieved the per capita energy consumption of the United States then the total energy consumption of the world would rise by a factor of about 4.5. This would make a large demand on fuel supplies and probably increase pollution beyond a sustainable level. This paper examines the limits to the theoretical efficiency of power generation, including both heat engines and fuel cells, and demonstrates that thermal efficiencies of above 60 per cent are achievable in each case if combined plants are used. It is shown that the fuel cell has benefits over the heat engine when the plant operates for a significant time at low load.

AB The new millennium will present daunting challenges for the world community: how to sustain prosperity while preserving the global environment in the presence of increasing world population. Science and technology hold the keys to resolving this well-publicized "tri-lemma" of balancing economy and environment under the increasing burden of population growth.
   Technologies have been developing rapidly in recent years and their impact is being felt in every corner of the global community. It is expected that the process will only accelerate and expand in the new millennium. This, together with people's aspirations for better life, will put enormous demands on energy production. Thus, energy and environment will remain two poles of a central global issue in the new century. Electricity's role in mitigating environmental degradation is well known and global electrification promises the best hope for achieving globally sustainable growth. The question is then how to produce energy that can generate electricity harmoniously with environment. Nuclear power offers the best answer, as it is one of the few non-carbon sources that can produce electricity in significant quantity.
   In examining the big picture of global priorities for the new millennium, the role of electrification and nuclear power is brought to the fore in the context of globally sustainable growth, and a strategic roadmap for revival of nuclear option is proposed.

AB Nuclear power at present does possess proven technologies that ensure adequate safety levels and safe radwaste disposal. Many in the nuclear community support the idea that further development in the nuclear industry should be evolutionary rather than revolutionary. The author argues that the nuclear industry needs to work on new, innovative technologies in order to reduce significantly the costs and to facilitate the dialogue between the nuclear industry and the public by providing more transparent, convincing solutions in safety and non-proliferation areas. A successful development of innovative nuclear technologies addressing two key challenges: competitiveness and public acceptance would permit a large-scale development of nuclear energy in the next century.

AB The purpose of this study is to analyze the role of nuclear power in the sustainable energy supply future of Korea. For this purpose, an energy-economy interaction model of the computational general equilibrium (CGE) approach, the Korean Energy and Environmental Policy model(KEEP) was adapted. The model is a non-linear optimization model that maximizes the discounted value of Korean economic utility. The model operates over the time horizon of 1995-2040 in annual steps.
   Some scenarios are established in accordance with three possible nuclear growth rate and the strength of the carbon tax imposed. At first, business as usual(BAU) nuclear growth scenario was set up and maintaining the current installed capacity and phasing out the nuclear power options are considered. After that, the investigation has been done on each scenario in the case that a tax for CO2 emission regulation was imposed.
   Results show that limiting CO2 emissions with a nuclear phase out scenario will have the most serious impact on the economic welfare compared with the other scenarios. If the CO2 emission target will be imposed in Korea in the foreseeable future, nuclear power will play an important role in mitigating the economic impacts.
   This analysis gives us a chance to consider the trade-offs between the most important energy issues of today-concerns with the risk of nuclear power, those involving future climate change, and energy security. (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB With economy developing rapidly and energy demand increasing promptly, the environmental pollution was intensified in China. In order to achieve economy sustainable development, the electricity industry must adjust existing energy structure and adopt new efficiency clean generation technology. However, in exiting electricity planning, nuclear energy develops slowly due to lack of funds and technology The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) provided an opportunity and challenge for developing country parties in achieving sustainable development.
   The "Clean Development Mechanism" (CDM) was proposed by the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nation Framework Convention on Climate Change. It aims at assisting developing country parties to achieve sustainable development, and assisting developed country parties to achieve their obligation of emission reduction promised in the Kyoto Protocol in lower cost. It means it is a mutual beneficial mechanism that could be implemented between developed and developing countries. Therefore there is much interest in CDM by international bodies.

AB National Parks and other figures linked to environmental managing have changed their objectives. Nowadays the social and economic development of the areas nearby Parks is one of the first aims that politicians, staff, social actors, researchers and all the society do must have in mind. The emergence of new paradigms suggests us the following questions: Which is the influence of Parks on the welfare of people living near them? and How should natural areas be organized so as to make possible both high standard of environment and economic results? The paper shows us the convenience of specific methodological proposals supported on GIS in order to evaluate the progress on the economic side and its influence on the environmental traditional objectives.

AB Countries of the developing world are characterized by rapid urbanization, high growth rates of traffic and congestion, and decreasing regulation of public transport. Because the majority of the developing world's inhabitants depend on public transport services for their mobility needs, safe, effective, and efficient public transport is essential to ensure adequate and affordable accessibility and the sustainable development of livelihoods in the rural and urban sectors. The operational environment of the public transport sector in Nepal, India, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe is examined, as well as the extent of accidents involving public transport vehicles and the likely causes. Finally, recommendations are made to reduce both the severity and the number of public transport accidents.

AB Demographic change, new family structures, and concerns about personal safety are contributing to a growing use of motorized transportation by women. The increasing importance of women as travelers has implications for the ways in which transportation policy must be reviewed in an era when sustainable development has become a key issue. An appreciation of the particular nature of women's travel behavior, and their designed behavior, could facilitate an easier path to sustainability. The travel patterns, needs, and psychology of women are examined, as well as the influence of these patterns and behavior on efforts to promote sustainable development. Women's travel patterns differ in important ways from those of men. In particular, gender differences arise in (a) the distance traveled, (b) the mode of travel, and (c) the complexity and purpose of trip making. The particular psychology of women contributes to these patterns. In comparison with men, women tend to be prone to ambivalent feelings, but their analysis of these feelings can prompt leaps in thought and creative solutions to problems. In addition, women are more risk averse than men. Risk aversion may affect women's travel decisions-for example, when security is a concern. Changes in the economy also are placing new demands and constraints on women, their lives, and their travel patterns. Future research on women and transportation should focus on the psychological aspects of women's travel, the special travel needs and circumstances of women, and the influence of changing economic conditions on women's travel patterns and the environment.

AB SunSmart is a programme of the Anti-Cancer Council of Victoria. It is an evidence-based health promotion programme where decisions about the form and content of the programme are influenced by available evidence and community consultation processes. A systematic evaluation and research strategy is in place to ensure that as much information as possible is available on process, impact and outcomes. Over the past 19 years the Anti-Cancer Council of Victoria has made a substantial impact in Victoria in relation to sun protection. It is one of the very few campaigns that has been able to demonstrate substantial changes not only in behaviour and attitudes but also in the downturn of skin cancer rates. Substantial sustainable changes have also occurred in the physical landscape as public authorities and commercial operators design their environment to be as sun protective as possible. This paper focuses on the key strategies that have encouraged positive change in the behaviour and attitudes of the Victorian population and the research that has documented the outcomes.

AB Sustainable use of wildlife has become equated with exploitation of animal products (meat, skin or feathers) and/or removal of wild progenitors into the pet trade. This consumption of the wildlife is therefore largely ex situ and so removes nutrients and energy from the rangelands. Demand for lethal or a removal action is often driven by the severity of the perceived conflict between the wildlife and other enterprises, especially agriculture, rather than for the resulting products. Such uses also raise community concerns about humane treatment of animals and a valuing of the natural heritage. Wildlife-based tourism, as part of the valuable and growing nature-based or ecotourism industry in Australia, is an in situ use that may be a more ecologically sustainable and economically viable option for use of rangeland wildlife. This paper examines these possibilities and their problems with a focus on the commercial kangaroo industry and the use of arid-zone mammals, birds and reptiles for pets. It provides new evidence that wildlife-tourism based on free-living kangaroos in the rangelands is both feasible and in demand. This industry should be given advocacy in the on-going debate on the management and future of the rangelands.

AB Correlation between vegetation composition, soil quality, and grazing since the introduction of pastoralism, were investigated on mid-altitude Brown Soils in the Ids Valley, Central Otago, New Zealand. Sampling sites were chosen to minimise the effects of environmental variation whilst maximising differences in vegetation as a consequence of long-term (100+ years) pastoralism (e.g. either side of fence lines). Gradient analysis was used to order 31 sites and the underlying gradient was identified through correlation with site factors and management information. A pattern of vegetation change along the first gradient (unrelated to altitude or aspect) showed dense Chionochloa rubra (red tussock) present where grazing intensities had been lowest. Induced mixed short fescue tussock (Festuca spp.) and adventive grass were present in the middle of the gradient, whilst Hieracium pilosella (mouse-ear hawkweed) dominated those sites where long-term (100 year+) grazing intensities had been highest. H. pilosella invasion is viewed not as a consequence of current grazing intensities, but rather invasion has occurred at a faster rate and more completely into vegetation types where long-term grazing intensities have been greatest.
   Soil physical properties showed lower total porosity, macroporosity, and water content, and higher bulk density, with vegetation composition associated with higher long-term grazing intensities. Soil biological properties also showed lower hot water extracted carbon (labile C) and anaerobically mineralisable N in these soils, although the pattern for the latter was not consistent across all fence lines.
   It was concluded that vegetation change accompanied by a loss of desirable soil properties has been greatest where long-term grazing intensities have been highest. This loss of properties may be affecting the ability of some plants to grow and survive drought. It is not known if soil changes are in equilibrium with vegetation changes.

AB The importance of biomass as the most accessible primary energy source in Cameroon is presented. The valorization of wood wastes and residues is seen as a way of implementing the sustainable use of biomass resources. A recent survey of wood-based industries in Cameroon reveals that large volumes of industrial wood residues are generated in the rain forest areas and are unefficiently used. Important quantities are lost in the form of burning in the four main forestry provinces, while other parts of the country suffer from fuelwood shortage. With the exception of the plywood factories, the wood industry is essentially dependent on commercial energy. An analysis made to show the economic and environmental benefits of converting wood residues to energy for industrial and domestic use is presented. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Complexity and multi-disciplinary represent the challenge that the design and construction of sustainable buildings have to face. The nature and quantity of information needed are further considerations which lead to re-thinking the whole design process. The architect alone cannot have all the skills required, so he/she should be able to rely on other specialized professionals. In some European countries, environmental consultancy-which deals with ecology matters-is becoming more and more crucial for the design of a successful building. Taking into account two British consultancy companies-investigated as case studies-this paper looks at the way the design process related to complex projects is managed, and at the effects on the architectural sector.

SO RENEWABLE ENERGY

DT Article
AB Sustainability is regarded as a major consideration for both urban and rural development. People have been exploiting the natural resources with no consideration to the effects-both short term (environmental) and long term (resource crunch). It is felt that knowledge and technology have not been used optimistically. The urban areas depend to a large extent on commercial energy sources. The rural areas use non-commercial sources like firewood, agricultural wastes. Even this is decreasing over the years, with the Villagers wanting to adopt the ready to use sophisticated technology. The debate now is to identify a suitable via media. The option that fills this gap aptly is the renewable energy source. Though it is often argued that the link between renewable energy and sustainability is only theoretical and academical rather than practical, it must be realised that in the long run renewable energy is the only option that could meet the growing energy needs. An attempt has been made here to analyse the supply side management of energy resources contrary to demand side management which is followed now. The results reveal that exergy destruction is reduced thus increasing the returns and paving the way for sustainable development. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

This paper considers a multiple-attribute decision making problem in which three soil tillage alternatives - conventional tillage, no-till, and ridge-till - are evaluated based on a finite number of hierarchically arranged attributes. Web-HIPRE, a newly developed Java-applet for multiple criteria decision making by Hamalainen [10], is used to show that no-till agriculture is the most desirable farm management practice with respect to surface and groundwater objectives in Southwestern Ontario, Canada.

AB As in most fisheries world-wide, the South African rock lobster fishery is fraught with complexities and conflict. In addition to ensuring the sustainability of fishing resources, decision-makers are increasingly also required to weigh up the political, economic and social aspects of fisheries in a transparent and participative way. This is a particularly difficult task in light of the uncertainty surrounding biomass estimates and projections of future resource productivity. Fisheries management decisions typically impact upon numerous stakeholder groups, and there is a powerful lobby for less bureaucracy, and more stakeholder participation in fisheries management. The South African situation is unique in that fisheries management policy has been significantly influenced by the government's Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP), aimed at rectifying the wrongs of the apartheid past. This research was carried out at a time of great change and transition, when a new fisheries policy for the country was being formulated and negotiated. As consultants, our task was to structure the messy problems facing the scientific working group upon whose recommendations management decisions are taken. Fishing company directors, government officials, scientists, labour union representatives and informal fishermen were involved in the planning process. A soft-OR method called SODA, as well as multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA), were used to provide group decision support to this diverse group of stakeholders.

AB The management system for solid and liquid organic waste affects the environment and surrounding technical systems in several ways. In order to decrease the environmental impact and resource use, biological waste treatment and alternative solutions for sewage treatment are often advocated. These alternatives include increased agricultural use of waste residuals. To analyse whether such proposed systems indicate improvements for the environment and its sustainability, systems analysis is a useful method The changes in environmental impact and resource use is not only a result of changes in waste treatment methods, but also largely a result of changes in surrounding systems (energy and agriculture) caused by changes in waste management practices. In order to perform a systems analysis, a substance-flow simulation model, the organic waste research model (ORWARE), has been used. The results are evaluated by using methodology from life cycle assessment (LCA). An economic analysis was also performed on three of the studied scenarios. The management system for solid organic waste and sewage in the municipality of Uppsala, Sweden, was studied. Three scenarios for different treatments of solid waste were analysed: incineration with heat recovery, composting, and anaerobic digestion. These three scenarios included conventional sewage treatment. A fourth scenario reviewed was anaerobic digestion of solid waste, using urine-separating toilets and separate handling of the urine fraction. The results are only valid for the case study and under the assumptions made. In this case study anaerobic digestion result in the lowest environmental impact of all the solid waste management systems, but is costly. Economically, incineration with heat recovery is the cheapest way to treat solid waste. Composting gives environmental advantages compared to incineration methods, without significantly increased costs. Urine separation, which may be implemented together with any solid waste treatment, has great advantages, particularly in its low impact on the environment. However, there is a large increase in acidification. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

ID DESIGN; WASTE
AB A normative strategy is proposed for resource choice and recycling to meet the criterion of sustainability, defined as near constancy of natural resources. In this strategy resource choice should be fitted to the fate of products and product wastes, with geochemically scarce virtually non-renewable resources being reserved for uses that allow for nearly 100% recycling and negligible loss of irretrievable material and material deterioration. Sustainable recycling is argued to be strongly dependent on product design that slows loss of quality by products and materials. Recycling processes should aim at quality conservation by cascading. Non-product and recycling outputs should match with required inputs into the economy. Finally technologies should be employed that prevent the build-up of contaminants in products. Examples are given of the ways in which elements of this normative strategy may be implemented. Internalisation of currently external costs will strongly favour the proposed strategy.

AB One of the purposes of the present paper is to understand the concept of community development as close related to the notion of social change dynamics, under the influence of psychological and socio-cultural variables. The article also focus on how the variables are related with the social acceptance or rejection of community innovations. This paper analyzes community development as a complex output of two processes: (1), external in nature, named "implantation", Known to be the activities supported by institutions promoting social change; and (2) other internal, called "assimilation", concerned with the way the community members accept and appropriate the innovation. The present analysis is exclusively centered in the implantation process and its elements: the needs for implantation, the relations emerging from this process, the implantation plan, the stabilization of the implantation process and the generalization, and innovation sustainability.

AB This research investigates the livelihood systems of two mountain villages in the northwest Himalaya, focussing or? household strategies of diversification as a means of maintaining livelihood security Field research was carried out with women of different age and caste from 32 households. Eight strategies were found to be of particular importance: (1) the diversification of activities and household inputs, (2) the maintenance of crop biodiversity and landscape diversity in the agricultural system, (3) the increased negotiations with the market, (4) the reliance on agricultural wage labour (5) the building up and drawing down of household inventories, (6) the reliance on common property resources, (7) the development of social networks, and (8) the formation of community groups. Policy for sustainable livelihoods in mountain ecosystems must be firmly rooted in an understanding of these complex strategies and the knowledge of women's own efforts to ensure that their households are secure and resilient.

AB Through the past three decades development agencies have increasingly adopted the rhetoric of participatory development This shift has been informed by a desire to achieve greater sustainability of initiated projects. This paper examines the relationship between participatory development and international development interventions, and focuses on the difficulty of adopting participatory strategies while maintaining existing, powerful development agencies. The significance of participatory development has, however, remained minimal as changes in the praxis of development have seldom resulted from the rhetoric.

AB In the participatory land management approach, the strategies for sustainable development are based on the definition of new relationships between the land and its users. Rational managerial and accountable decisions and actions allow adequate responses to local planning needs and interests, provided that the management units relevant to each group are well identified. They are based on the socio-cultural incentives of all stakeholders and their perceptions and knowledge of the natural resources. Such an approach is presented and discussed from a case study in Burkina Fare. It relies on PRA tools and GIS techniques to develop an information system to support a multiple level planning process.

TI Populations of large mammals and ostriches in Zakouma National Park,
   Chad: their status and trends
SO REVUE D ECOLOGIE-LA TERRE ET LA VIE
LA French
DT Article
AB Zakouma National Park is situated in the south-east of Chad Republic and covers more than 3000 km(2). Rehabilitated in 1989, it is certainly one of the best-preserved wildlife sanctuaries in Sahelian Africa. Aerial census shows that most of its original fauna is still present, making the Park an exception in the region despite the recent troubled history of this country. Total population estimates of elephants, buffaloes and topis are given and distribution maps are presented for eleven species. Results are compared with two previous estimates. Except for the ostrich and perhaps the warthog, probably in regression, the populations of two species are stable (hartebeest and giraffe) while the others are clearly increasing (buffalo, topi, elephant and room antelope). Those encouraging results are the consequence of the remoteness of the park, wich is far from any big town, and also overflooded and isolated during the wet season. Those facts contribute to maintain the human pressure at a sustainable level.

AB The use of exotic entomophagous insects to control pests of agriculture is more than one century old. During the fifties, development of classical biological control have been noted consecutively to the increase of agronomic problems due to the rise of chemical control. After a development of scientific and ecological approaches, biological control is more and more considered as an economic and safety strategy of integrated pest control for environment and is now developped in many agricultural systems.
   The industrial and commercial development of biological control joined to the awareness of the problem of protection of environnement and biodiversity are at the origin of the question of the non-target effects of introductions of exotic entomophagous insects. As a matter of fact, such strategy commonly considered as safe for environnement may have undesirable effects on indigenous species or ecosystems. Precautionary measures, needs of complementary studies and also regulations are recommended to limit these non-target effects with the aim to facilitate biological control strategy as an important part of integrated pest management in a sustainable agriculture.

AB The aids epidemic has confronted the health systems with problems for which they were badly-prepared, thus explaining the controversy over the role of the State and the public intervention methods. In the European welfare states, only medical treatment could be adequately catered for by the existing institutional structures. Prevention, however, required the development of new structures and approaches, taking into account the lateral coordination of policies, the specific situation of socially underprivileged populations and the border line between what was considered as private and what as public issues. This article analyses how the different health systems in Europe responded to the challenge of the epidemic. It elaborates the national models of institutional change, which emerged with the epidemic but whose objectives reach beyond it to aim at sustainable public health policies.

DE social security; majority voting
AB We consider a two-period overlapping generations model in which individual voters differ by age and by productivity. In such a setting, a redistributive pay-as-you-go system is politically sustainable, even when the interest rate is higher than the rate of population growth. The workers with medium wages (not those with the lowest wages) and the retirees form a majority which votes for a positive level of social security. This level depends on the difference between the rates of population growth and interest as well as on the redistributiveness of the benefit rule.

AB In Finland, Norway and Sweden forest management is presently changing towards a more nature-orientated management. In this study the European Forest Information SCENario (EFISCEN) model was applied to determine how this change might affect the potential for wood production in the three countries. Three different management regimes, traditional, traditional with nature conservation ("conservation"), and longer rotations with nature conservation ("conservation +"), were combined with two alternative felling levels. The results show that conserving 6.1-8.8% of the older forests in the southern regions had no limiting effects on production levels, as foreseen by the European Timber Trend Studies V by the UN-ECE for Finland and Sweden. Under the conservation + scenario, maximum sustainable felling levels decreased to 84, 79 and 72% of the present levels in Finland, Norway and Sweden, respectively. Increasing the rotation length put more pressure on the older age classes and thus did not increase the average age of the forest. If the consumption of wood increases as quickly as indicated by other studies, it will be hard to fulfil that demand and at the same time conserve considerable areas of forest in the southern regions of the countries.

AB This article focuses on a neglected aspect of international trade in services i.e. trade in Higher Education. The purpose of the research endeavour is to draw together the determinants of this trade using its most visible aspect - foreign students. There are many categories of foreign student, but the study is confined to those students who opt to complete higher education outside the home country. There is much competition among host nations for international students and the factors influencing demand for and supply of university places for foreign students are considered, using medical educations as a case study. Little if any attention has been given to theory generation in this field and this study was undertaken to redress the balance. The model presented here clearly illustrates the many variables which impact on a student's decision to study overseas, and their choice of destination, the most critical one being information.

AB Using the Finnish MELA model, a set of scenarios were produced and used to map the possibilities and risks surrounding the utilisation of peatlands in wood production in Finland. One of the scenarios was an estimate of allowable-cut calculated by maximising the net present value of the future revenues using a four per cent interest rate subject to non-decreasing flow of wood, saw logs and net income over a 50-year period, and net present value after the 50 year period greater or equal than in the beginning. The estimate for maximum regionally sustained removal in 1996-2005 was 68 million m(3) per year - approaching 74 million m(3) during the next decades. In this scenario, 14 per cent of all cuttings during the period 1996-2005 would be made on peatlands, which comprise ca. 31 per cent of the total area of forestry land. By the year 2025, the proportion of peatland cuttings would increase to over 20 per cent. The increase in future cutting possibilities on peatlands compensated for a temporary decrease in cuttings and growing stock on mineral soils. The allowable-cut effect was especially pronounced in northern Finland, where peatlands play an important role in wood production. In addition, the sensitivity of cutting possibilities for assumptions related to growth and price were analysed. The estimate of maximum sustainable yield as defined here seems to be fairly robust on the whole, except in northern Finland where the cutting scenarios were sensitive to the changes in the price of birch pulpwood. The proportion of peatland stands that are profitable for timber production depends on the interest rate: the higher the rate. of interest the less peatland stands are thinned. The effect of cutting profile on future logging conditions and resulting costs were analysed in two forestry centres. If clear cuttings on mineral soils are to be cut first, an increase in future logging costs is inevitable.

AB Large-scale forest scenario models are intensively used to make projections of forest areas of up to hundreds of millions of hectares. Within Europe, such projections have been done for 11 countries at the individual national scale, most often to foresee the long-term implications of the ongoing forest management. However, the validity of the models has rarely been tested.
   The aim of this study was 1. to validate the European Forest Information SCENario model (EFISCEN) by running it on historic Finnish forest inventory data, 2. to improve the model based on the validation, and 3. to project the Finnish forest development till 2050 with the improved model under alternative scenarios.
   The results of the validation showed that EFISCEN is capable of making reliable large-scale projections of forest resources for periods up to 50-60 years. Based on the validation, the model was improved concerning simulation of age development, thinning regimes and regrowth after thinning. The projection of the Finnish forests till 2050 with the improved model presented a maximum sustainable felling level of around 70 million m(3) per year. That provides an average growing stock of 106 m(3) ha(-1) in 2050 and a net annual increment. of 3.6 m(3) ha(-1) y(-1). If the current trend towards more nature oriented forest management continues and 1.39 million ha of forests have been set aside additionally for nature reserves by 2050, the felling level could meet a realistic demand of 57 million m(3) per year in 2050. Under the latter regime the average growing stock will have grown to 160 m(3) ha(-1) in 2050.

AB The long-term financial and ecological effects of diameter-limit regimes and basal-area-diameter-q-ratio (BDq) regimes were compared by simulation in the case of northern hardwood forests. Varying the cutting cycle between 10 and 20 years had little effect on returns or stand structure. A 28-cm diameter-limit cut gave the highest production and financial returns, and the highest species diversity, but considerably lower size diversity. A 38-cm diameter-limit cut and a heavy BDq selection harvest gave high returns, while maintaining high levels of diversity. On lands of equal site quality, Michigan's stands were more productive than Wisconsin's. The results suggest that it is possible to manage northern hardwood stands sustainably with diameter-limit cuts, combined with removal of poorly performing understory trees. Adjusting the diameter limit gave rise to stands similar in productivity and structure to those obtained by BDq cutting regimes. Given their simplicity of implementation and monitoring, more attention should be given to diameter-limit cutting regimes, with attendant stand improvement measures, as a practical means for uneven-aged management of northern hardwoods.

AB During the course of the past ten years, the World Bank has become the single largest external financier of health activities in low and middle income countries and an important voice in national and international debates on health policy. This article highlights the Bank's new strategic direction in the health sector aimed at: improving health, nutrition, and population outcomes of the poor; enhancing the performance of health care systems; and securing sustainable health care financing.
   Millions of preventable deaths and treatable illnesses, together with health systems that are inefficient, inequitable and ineffective, have motivated expanded Bank support for the health sector in many of its client countries. The new policy directions and system-wide reforms observed in these countries are the result of both demand and supply factors. It is part of a general shift in the Bank's approach to development assistance, which sees systemic reform as a way to improve the impact and sustainability of investments in health. On the demand side, the Bank is trying to adapt to ongoing political, technological, economic, demographic, epidemiological and social pressures. On the supply side, the Bank's growing international experience and substantial financial resources are used to complement the development assistance provided by other organizations and the global effort to improve health and health systems in low and middle income countries.

TI Public pension reform in Japan
SO SOCIAL SECURITY BULLETIN
LA English
DT Article
AB The March 2000 pension reform in Japan focused on the long-term financial sustainability of the country's two-tiered public pension system. The government opted for incremental changes in order to maintain pension solvency through 2060. Those changes could reduce future pension funding liability by an estimated one-third. Further, the decision to avoid structural reforms of its pension programs was based on fiscal considerations. Expanding general revenue funding for the first tier from the current share of one-third to cover the entire cost would require increases in the consumption tax that proved to be politically unacceptable. Fully privatizing the second, earnings-related tier would entail transition costs too great to bear at a time of rising budget deficits. In addition, the Japanese public generally supported the sharing of financial burden for public pension programs through a combination of benefit cuts, a raise in the pensionable age, and contribution rate increases. If current cost projections prove to be inaccurate, future pension reviews (scheduled every 5 years) will give the government further opportunity to fine-tune program changes.

AB Annual production of citrus in Florida amounts to over $1.6 billion. Fertilization and irrigation play important roles in the sustainable production of citrus. Because of increased concern over water quality, improved agricultural practices to increase nutrient utilization efficiency and to minimize nutrient loss are required. Citrus (Citrus spp.) trees have been grown in Florida for nearly 500 yr, and application of fertilizer to citrus can be traced back to the late 1800s. From the 1930s to the early 1980s, studies were conducted to understand the effects of fertilization on yield and quality of citrus. The information and knowledge generated during that period are still useful in guiding current citrus fertilization practices. Since the introduction of irrigation practices in the 1980s, the interactions of irrigation and fertilization on citrus production and water quality have become a major focus of research. Studies on best management practices (BMPs) in the 1990s has added more to our understanding of citrus production with regard to water quality as affected by water and nutrient management. Progress also has been made in the development of optimized fertilization programs to enhance citrus production and to minimize impact on water quality. Future studies need to be directed to integrated approaches to optimize fertilization and irrigation programs and to increase the soil's holding capacity for nutrients and water, thereby reducing nutrient leaching and subsequent contamination to surface and ground water.

AB Soils are relevant to society in diverse ways, supplying various economic and cultural services or functions as well as being the substrate for plants and a life-support system. Attitudes to the diverse kinds of soil resources and resulting land-use practices throughout human history indicate that mankind has frequently used other than the most fertile or easiest accessible soils. Many special techniques, such as terracing, have been developed to utilize and preserve less accessible land and shallow soil on slopes. Soil degradation and erosion following deforestation have frequently been a problem in the past, especially when some land was abandoned for cultural or economic reasons. Better data on current degree and extent of soil degradation are needed.
   Man has made soils fertile on a large scale, providing more secure food resources for the ever growing population. Yet, there is a growing threat to soils, in many instances, on marginal soils or in less resilient soil regions. A good environmental ethic requires equally good soil care of open spaces and of forests, woods, and deserts for better quality of life and for future generations of town and country populations. For this purpose an Eleventh Commandment was formulated a generation ago, and efforts are now being made to institute an internationally secured global treaty or soil convention for better soil care and sustainable use of soils. Soil scientists need to support such proposals and to bridge the gaps and differences between local and governmental efforts.

AB National well-being will continue to depend on the productive use of soils, but society will increasingly demand that soils be managed sustainably, Soil scientists, therefore, need to contribute technology to land management in a holistic way to satisfy society's requirements. They must also help formulate public policy, contribute to public understanding of environmental issues, and be alert to opportunities provided by new knowledge to improve soil and land management. Close cooperation with land owners and managers is necessary. Appropriate training of soil scientists is needed to prepare them for these responsibilities. Training in the natural sciences is a prerequisite for both vocational and research careers in soil science. This basic training should be concurrent with, or followed by, adequate exposure to the principal subdisciplines of soil science. Training in team-based problem solving is essential. Examples that support these assertions are discussed.

AB Wheat in the semiarid region of Argentina has often been grown as a low-input crop, Rainfall scarcity and distribution are the main characteristics of this region. The knowledge of the combined effects of crop rotation and fertilization on soil physical and chemical properties are the key for a sustainable crop production. Soil properties for an Entic Haplustoll in the semiarid region of Argentina were evaluated, where differ ent crop rotations were used for 15 years. Wheat-wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) (WW), wheat-grazing natural grasses (WG) and wheat-legume [vetch (Vicia sativa L,) plus oat (Avena sativa L.) or Triticale (Triticum aestivum L. x Secale cereale L,)] (WL) rotations with and without fertilizer (64 kg N and 16 kg P ha(-1)) were studied. The annual wheat cropping system (WW) resulted in the lowest soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (N-t) levels. Extractable phosphorus (P-ext) values were sufficient for wheat growth with all treatments and decreased with depth. Fertilizer applications significantly increased the proportion of large pores (>8.81 mu m) in the 0-0.07 m depth of the WW and WG system plots. A decrease in the proportion of medium size pores (0.19-8.81 mu m) and in the water holding capacity was observed in the WG rotation plots. The fertilized treatments resulted in the following sequence of available water: WL > WW > WG, Bulk density was similar with all treatments for each depth, except with the fertilized WG treatment that had the lowest value in the 0-0.07 m depth. These results showed the positive influence of legume inclusion (WL) and alternate cable grazing (WG) on SOC and N-t contents, (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Wheat (Triticum aestivum L,) in the semiarid region of Argentina has often been grown as a low-input crop. Rainfall scarcity and distribution are the main characteristics of the region. Consequently, a knowledge of the effect of different management practices is the key to sustainable crop production, The objective of this work was to study the effect of 15 years of different wheat management practices on plant nutrition, dry matter production and grain yield and quality. The treatments were: continuous wheat (WW), wheat-grazing natural grasses (WG) and wheat-legume: [vetch (Vicia sativa L,) plus oat (Avena sativa L.) or Triticale (Triticum aestivum L, x Secale cereale L,)] (WL), with and without fertilizer (N + P) application. The WW and WL treatments involved annual tillage and a long fallow period (4-6 months) under stubble mulch, and WG involved annual alternate tillage and a short fallow (1 month). The experiment was started in 1975 and the data presented were obtained in 1989, Wheat yields were higher with the WW than with the WG rotation, but in both rotations fertilization was required to obtain better grain quality (protein content higher than 11 per cent). The wheat-legume rotation resulted in the highest yield, protein content, and better yield components. Fertilizer application did not increase dry matter production but improved nutrient uptake and grain quality. Yield component differences could be attributed to water availability due to different fallow length. The wheat-legume rotation seemed to be the best practice in the semiarid Pampean region.

TI The Kyoto mechanisms and the prospects for renewable energy technologies
SO SOLAR ENERGY
LA English
DT Article
AB The Kyoto protocol to the Climate Change Convention sets out legally binding emission targets and timetables for developed countries. In order to ease compliance, it allows countries to achieve their emission targets through the 'Kyoto Mechanisms'. These mechanisms comprise International Emissions Trading (ET), Joint Implementation (JI), and a Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). This paper analyses the capacity of the proposed mechanisms of the Kyoto Protocol to promote investment in renewable energy technologies (RETs). Analysis of abatement costing studies indicates that the increasing use of renewable energy tends to be a higher cost option compared with other greenhouse gas (GHG) abatement technologies. This finding, however, does not make RETs unattractive for GHG mitigation as such because, apart from their vast technical potential to reduce GHG emissions, RETs have great capacity to contribute to other aspects of sustainable development. The extent of investment into renewable energy induced by the Kyoto mechanisms will depend on whether the rules and guidelines that are to be developed in the coming years will explicitly support renewables. The Kyoto mechanisms could be instrumental in leading to significant investment into these resources if rules are defined appropriately. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

DT Article
AB This paper presents some thermodynamic indicators useful for energy planning of urban areas, and for defining the scenarios of integrated low environmental impact energy strategies and actions in an urban area. It is based on the results of the energy balance of a reference volume obtained by the Geographical Information System (GIS) techniques applied to the built-up area studied. The defined parameters allow evaluation of the sustainability of energy use in an urban area and its areal distribution in different building meshes superimposed on the area considered, using entropy.

SO SOLVENT EXTRACTION AND ION EXCHANGE
LA English
DT Article
AB This article discusses the application of separation technologies, in particular solvent extraction and ion exchange in the uranium nuclear fuel cycle. The history and decisions in selecting the technology are briefly discussed. The global trends in the energy sector are reviewed and the impact of other energy sources on the nuclear power industry both now and in the future is described. The effect of over capacity in uranium mining and milling, UOC refining and uranium enrichment on the development of new technology is a key feature of this article. Although over capacity is not the case with irradiated fuel reprocessing, other constraints limit the development of new technology and/or process improvements. The environmental considerations of all stages of the uranium nuclear fuel cycle will require better process technology and it is this key balance between the environmental and economic considerations that constitute a key component of this article. Some new solvent extraction processes that may offer a way forward to the segregation of actinides from highly active waste, integrated technologies and non aqueous systems are discussed.

AB "Sociopolitical strategies for Russia's development" (by Victor Levashov) looks into the issues of sociopolitical developments surfacing in Russia at the end of the millenium. A systems approach to the balance sheet of the century is suggested to support a plea for strategic correctives in the development of Russian society and state. A choice of eventual social and political strategies is formulated embracing liberal fundamentalism, oligarchic autarky, and social solidarity. Certain foci for sociopolitical consolidation of the society and state are argued for to launch a strategy of social solidarity and sustainable development.

ID INODORUS
AB A roving creel survey of recreational shore anglers in Namibia was used to determine catch and effort of line-fishing. A stratified sample of 240 anglers was surveyed to determine expenditures. Results showed that, between October 1996 and September 1997. some 8 800 anglers spent around 173 000 days angling and had direct expenditures of N$29.7 million. In all, 93% of angling took place in the West Coast Recreational Area. Some 44% of anglers were foreign visitors who contributed 55% of the expenditures. Value added to gross national income within the shore-angling fishery was N$14 million, equivalent to 3.6% of the value of the whole fisheries sector. The expenditures ultimately amounted (through a multiplier) to a gross national income of N$3 069 per angler, or N$27 million in aggregate. These amounts could be sustainable ii policies to reduce fish mortality without affecting angler numbers are implemented.

AB This article reviews papers from a recent conference on community action research in order to identify factors that contribute to long-term maintenance, sustainability, or institutionalization of community project interventions. The descriptions of long-term outcomes and aftereffects of projects that emerged in the conference are valuable because relatively few instances of institutionalization have been documented in the scientific literature. After a general theoretical discussion of institutionalization in communities, the article identifies characteristics of successful community action programs that outlived their original funding. These characteristics include honoring community values and cultural relevance, cultivating key leader support, and utilizing indigenous staff. They also include developing local resources, maintaining flexibility, and leveraging prior success. The paper concludes by noting that aiming for policy and structural changes is a goal for an institutionalization of measures positively affecting desired health outcomes, even if the programs which created them are nor themselves sustained.

AB The major focus of this paper is the sustainability of a one-year demonstration project on drug misuse prevention, which was implemented in a local community affected by acute economic crisis and high unemployment. The project was initiated by the Institute of Psychiatry and Neurology, and supported by the European Commission. The primary goal of the project was to demonstrate that community-based prevention is possible and feasible within the context of current transitions in Poland. Its major outcome was a community prevention package consisting of a number of booklets and videos to assist other communities in their prevention efforts, Experiences from this study suggest that factors contributing to the sustainability of a community prevention project can be identified and emphasized through simple analysis of community surveys, as well as focus group discussion.

AB Sustainable highway-engineering improvements have been developed or adopted to mitigate the unique environmental impact that highways and roads have in Canadian Rocky Mountain National Parks, which are also World Heritage Sites. Three levels of sustainable highway development are presented. The first is the reconstruction or rehabilitation of park roads. Examples are presented from several national parks in which parkways and low-volume roads were reconstructed or repaired in ways that reduced impacts. The second is the development of the passing-lane system on the Trans-Canada Highway in the Rocky Mountain National Parks. The passing-lane system has extended the design service life of the two-lane highway by approximately 15 years while maintaining an acceptable level of service. The third example is the twinning of 18.6 km of the Trans-Canada Highway, which represents a logical next step in a program of sequential twinning following the passing-lane phase. Discussion includes the ways in which highway-engineering improvements were developed to address and mitigate numerous potential project impacts that were identified during environmental assessment. Included in the environmental mitigations were a series of measures such as fencing, animal-crossing structures, and underpasses to address wildlife movement, biodiversity, and mortality. Stream, terrain, and vegetation disturbance-minimization techniques also were applied. Research has found that the mitigation measures have been effective in reducing wildlife-vehicle collisions by as much as 97 percent.

AB The potential of using market-based reforms to address economic, social, and environmental problems associated with transportation is explored. Various transport-market distortions are identified and discussed, and strategies to reduce the distortions are described. Several technically feasible strategies are identified that increase consumer choice and encourage more efficient use of transportation resources. These are called "win-win transportation solutions." Three packages of state-level market reforms are evaluated for their impacts on vehicle travel, emissions, congestion, consumer expenses, tax revenue, and equity. The proposed reforms represent "no regrets" actions that are cost-effective and justified for their direct economic benefits while also achieving social and environmental objectives. This approach is particularly important for sustainable transportation. Win-win solutions are predicted to meet Kyoto emission-reduction targets, increase economic productivity and competitiveness, provide net benefits to consumers, and increase overall equity, while helping solve common transportation problems such as traffic congestion and facility costs.

AB A sustainable transportation system is one in which fuel consumption, vehicle emissions, safety, congestion, and access to social and economic opportunity are of such levels that they can be sustained into the indefinite future without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own transportation needs. Each of the stakeholders in the transportation system-local, state, and federal governments; the fuel and motor-vehicle industries; and public-transportation providers, users, and others-will have roles to play in moving toward sustainability. The motor-vehicle industry, as manufacturers of the vehicles that are used for 99 percent of the personal ground veh-km of travel, will need to participate proactively with all of the stakeholders in the transportation system as it addresses the challenges and opportunities in the areas of fuel consumption, emissions, congestion, safety, and access.

AB This study, which was conducted in the field during the 1997-1998 cropping season, assesses growth and symbiotic performance of six cowpea varieties (namely, Pan 311, Glenda, Bechuana white, Chappy, Encore and NWK) cultivated in a rich mineral N soil environment. The experiment was carried out on a sandy loam, Hutton form soil using randomized complete block design. At 42 and 63 d after emergence (DAE), the plants were assessed for nodulation, N-2 fixation, dry matter yield and tissue N concentration. Estimates of N fixed were determined using the N-15 natural abundance technique with maize as reference plant. Except variety Encore, which grew significantly (p<0.05) better than Pan 311, Glenda and NWK, the rest maintained similar plant growth. Nodulation varied significantly (p<0.05) among the six varieties, Pan 311 showing the lowest number of nodules per plant, in fact, a number of plants sampled from Pan 311 had no root nodules at 42 and 63 DAE. By contrast, Glenda, Chappy and NWK produced significantly (p<0.05) many more nodules under the same field conditions. At 42 DAE, the delta(15)N values for plant roots were between 4.77+/-0.3 parts per thousand and 5.46+/-0.7 parts per thousand, while at 63 DAE they varied from 5.05+/-2.6 parts per thousand to 5.89+/-1.6 parts per thousand. However, shoot delta(15)N values at 42 DAE were high, ranging from 7.09+/-0.4 parts per thousand. to 7.35+/-1.8 parts per thousand, and decreased at 63 DAE to lower levels, ranging from 5.12+/-4.7 parts per thousand to 5.80+/-1.1 parts per thousand. The delta(15)N value of the maize reference plant was 8.06+/-0.45 parts per thousand at 42 DAE and 7.34+/-0.68 parts per thousand. at 63 DAE. The high delta(15)N values obtained for these cowpea varieties were consistent with a low dependence on symbiotic fixation for their N nutrition. The proportion of plant N obtained from atmospheric fixation ranged from 32.3+/-10.1 to 48.8+/-14.8% at 42 DAE, and 235+/-2.4 to 41.1+/-10.5% at 63 DAE, clearly showing strong varietal differences in nodule functioning. Estimates of N fixed at 63 DAE show that Chappy and Encore fixed the highest amounts of N, while Pan 311 (the commercial variety) fixed the least. The marked differences (p<0.05) in nodulation and N-2 fixation exhibited by the six cowpea varieties was due to inhibition by mineral N. Analysis of soil at planting and at 63 DAE revealed very high concentrations of available N (NO3-N + NH4-N) in soil solution. About 13-40 mM was obtained for soil within 0-30 cm depth at planting, and 63.9-98.9 mM for the same depth at 63 DAE. The presence of such large concentrations of available N in soils of the experimental site was responsible for the poor nodulation and low level of N2 fixation in root nodules of the six cowpea cultivars. Nodule formation and function in the commercial variety (Pan 311) was for example very sensitive to soil mineral N, whereas Bechuana White, Encore and Chappy were more tolerant of this anion. Identifying legumes with relatively high rates of N-2 fixation in N-rich soils has potential for sustainably increasing yields of cereals and non-legume crops from the soil N spared by legume and from that fixed by symbiosis.

AB PV technology is of major interest for the energy sector because it offers the possibility of generating renewable electricity, using a resource that is widely available throughout the world, and without producing noticeable environmental externalities. The performance of the technology has progressed significantly over the last 20 years, thanks to learning effects, which have enabled PV diffusion to be extended beyond the initial niche markets. If this learning process can be maintained, PV may become an efficient technology for electricity generation and contribute to a sustainable world energy supply. Different technologies are competing in the production of PV cells. This paper analyses the mechanisms whereby one technology (crystalline silicon) has become established in a dominant position by using a knowledge base shared with the electronic components industry. The increasing diffusion of PV applications in new market segments as a result of public policies is then discussed, along with the resulting reinforcing mechanisms in favor of silicon technology. Given the limited progress margins remaining on this technological trajectory, a discussion is finally presented of new, more promising PV technologies and their possibilities for overcoming this lock-in situation and extending the current PV learning process.

TI A standardization of nature? The discursive structure and dynamics of
   environmental impact analysis
SO TIDSSKRIFT FOR SAMFUNNSFORSKNING
LA Norwegian
DT Article
AB Environmental impact analysis (EIA) was developed in the USA in the late 1960s, but was not mandated in Norway as a tool for environmental planning until 1989. In this paper, we investigate how EIA in the Norwegian context contributes to the production of knowledge about the environment. Starting from the fairly broad diagnosis provided by the concepts of risk society (Ulrich Beck) and ecological modernization (Maarten Hajer), the assumption is that EIA is consistent with a discursive structure emphasizing particularistic, local and shortterm problems.
   The study is based on an analysis of EIA guidelines provided by relevant government ministries and two case studies, one examining EIA in relation to a planned road development in Trondheim called 'Nordtangenten', the other investigating EIA in relation to plans for a new site for the furniture chain IKEA.
   The results are consistent with expectations about particularism, localness and short-term point of view, but it seems as if the production of knowledge about the environment provided by EIA is less controlled by the discursive structure outlined by guidance manuals and procedures than originally assumed. While the constructors responsible for performing EIA are clearly disciplined by considerations about reducing the environmental impact, the EIA documents become partisan in putting the view that the projects under planning are environmentally sustainable.

ID TECHNOLOGY
AB Norwegian energy policy on the promotion of energy efficiency is a well-defined goal, less clear is how it can be accomplished. A basic assumption of this article is the implicit importance of knowledge of the professions that contribute to the promotion of energyefficient solutions in building design. Architects, in particular, pray an important role in this process. The article analyses the relationship between architects and energy efficiency by investigating how the most important Norwegian journals of architecture handle these issues. It looks at how energy efficiency and environmentally sustainable building designs were presented in two Norwegian journals on architecture in the period 1970 to 1999, drawing upon theories from technology studies. The analysis shows that very few contributions in these journals focus on energy efficiency and sustainability in building design. The article therefore demonstrates the importance of taking into account meso-level features such as professional traditions and paradigms in coming to an understanding of the problems of implementing energyefficient technology. Macropolitical means for implementation of measures may prove ineffective if the meso-level is overlooked. The article suggests that this is likely to be the case with Norwegian energyefficiency policy.

ID IMPACT ASSESSMENT
AB Organisational and professional culture can be expected to play an important role in the implementation of environmental policy. The increased importance placed on integration of environmental concerns within sectoral administrations makes the possible discourse coalitions between the environmental core administrations and sectors an interesting development. An empirical study of attitudes, knowledge and thought styles in Nordic environmental administrations, as well as in some sector administrations at central and regional level, was carried out. Based on the results of this study the problems of integration and the possibility of emerging discourse coalitions are discussed. The problem of consensus over vague concepts such as sustainable development is also discussed.

DE restructuring discourses; Germany; discourse analysis; desolidarisation;

AB The German discourse on the future role of the state is currently at the turn of the millennium is dominated by the joint paper by Tony Blah and Gerhard Schroder, 'Europe: The Third Way/ Die Neue Mitte' (Blair ge Schroder 1999). Using the crisis of the post-war Fordist mode of regulation as a background, various concepts of the restructuring of the State and society are discussed. This paper intends to show that the prevailing dominant social democratic restructuring discourse is rooted in a number of important elements in preceding conservative and neo-liberal discourses about the future of society and the State. The notion of desolidarisation is identified as the common denominator of conservative and neo-liberal approaches as well as the 'Third Way' (Neue Mitte). To cope with growing social inequality it is argued that only a new European political project that re-animates solidarity and sustainability is viable.

AB Landowners along the Missouri River in Montana believe that the operation of Fort Peck Dam has initiated bank erosion, thus threatening agricultural development within the region. Their concerns have been heightened by proposals to increase discharge in order to enhance fisheries and wildlife interests. Geomorphological evaluation indicates that bed degradation and bank erosion have declined since construction of the dam, and the channel is now approaching dynamic equilibrium; public sensitivity to the proposed change is greater than the morphological sensitivity of the river. Sustainable management of the Missouri is now based on strategies that place more emphasis on partnership with local citizens.

DE Foucault; government; planning for housing; sustainable; development;
   south east England
AB Foucault's understanding of government as the 'conduct of conduct' is adopted in order to investigate how the state 'governs at a distance' across space and through time. Rationalities and techniques of governance are identified as the main means by which the state establishes 'networks' across the domains to be governed. The effort required to keep the networks in place is emphasized and it is indicated that conflict can emerge around the rationalities and techniques that underpin governmental networks. A case study examining how conflict unfolds is outlined drawn from the planning-for-housing sector in England. It is shown that governmental rationalities associated with 'developmentalism' are coming into conflict with those associated with 'sustainable development'. It is argued that a new rationality of government is thus beginning to recast the networks of planning and that this rationality privileges space over time.

AB Recent evidence suggests that eye-seeking flies are important trachoma vectors. We conducted a series of investigations to identify which species of synanthropic flies are potential vector(s) of this blinding disease in The Gambia. Several species of fly were caught in fish-baited attractant traps placed in villages throughout the year (1997/98) but only 2 species, Musca sorbens and M. domestica, were caught from the eyes of children. M. sorbens comprised <10% of the total number of flies caught with attractant traps but was responsible for >90% of fly-eye contacts, the remainder were made by M, domestica. All fly species were more numerous in the wet season than the dry season. Eyes of young children are considered to be the main reservoir of Chlamydia trachomatis, the causative agent of trachoma. Collections of eye-seeking flies from children showed frequent fly-eye contacts (median [interquartile range], 3 [1.5-7] every 15 min). Children with potentially infective ocular or nasal discharge had twice as many fly-eye contacts than children with no discharge (P < 0.001). There was no difference in exposure to fly-eye contacts ifa child sat inside or outside a house (P = 0.273). Female flies were more commonly caught from eyes than male (P < 0.001). The presence of Chlamydia DNA was demonstrated by PCR on 2 of 395 flies caught from the eyes of children with a current active trachoma infection. Both positive flies were M sorbens, one male and the other female. Further elucidation of M, sorbens behavioural ecology and the development of sustainable strategies to control these flies should be a priority. It is likely that M. sorbens is the principal insect vector of trachoma in The Gambia.

TI Sustainable urban development and transport - a Eurovision for 2020
SO TRANSPORT REVIEWS
LA English
DT Article
AB One of the major challenges for urban planning at the end of the century is the problem that the continuous growth in traffic has had on the achievement of sustainable urban development. This paper presents the major elements of the debate from a European perspective and it sketches out the choices available to decision-makers, together with the very considerable barriers to implementation. The major issues to be addressed, if transport is to conform to the principles of sustainable urban development, are outlined from an international perspective. The actions available are grouped under the three headings of technology, economic and financial, and regulation and planning. The particular problems in Europe relate to the shortage of space, higher densities and the protection of open space. It is argued that high-quality liveable cities must be the basis for sustainable urban development and policies should be implemented to achieve that objective, so the outward migration of residents is reversed. Sustainable living requires people to want to live in close proximity in an attractive, affordable urban environment. Recent research in Europe on the options available at the strategic and the city level will be cited to illustrate the actions that are now being considered to achieve sustainable transport in 2020. To achieve this objective, action is required on both the technology of transport and decoupling of transport from economic growth. In addition, the commitment and involvement of all affected parties is essential, so that imaginative and effective measures can be implemented.

TI Optimal transport strategies for European cities
SO TRANSPORTATION
LA English
DT Article
DE efficiency; optimisation; strategy; sustainability; transport; urban
AB A new procedure for generating optimal transport strategies has been applied in nine European cities. A public sector objective function which reflects concerns over efficiency, environmental impact, finance and sustainability is specified and a set of policy measures with acceptable ranges on each, identified. Optimal strategies based on combinations of these policy measures which generate the optimal value of the objective function, are identified, and compared between cities. Resulting policy recommendations are presented. The results demonstrate the importance of an integrated approach to transport strategy formulation. They emphasise the role of changes in public transport service levels and of fares, and of charges for car use. By contrast, new infrastructure projects are less frequently justified. In the majority of cities the revenues from car use charges are sufficient to finance other elements in the strategy. However, private sector involvement either in initial financing or in operation may be desirable. Revised objective functions to reflect private sector involvement are specified, and optimal strategies with private sector operation of public transport are also identified. The requirement to meet private sector rates of return for public transport operation typically results in lower frequencies and higher fares; charges for car use then need to be raised to satisfy public policy objectives, but system performance is reduced.

DT Article
AB Different criteria of intergenerational justice are used in a model where the present generation has the chance of implement a technical innovation that increases its welfare, but involves a risk of welfare loss for future generations caused by an irreversible environmental damage. A criterion of sustainability suggests that the present generation should not innovate for any parameters of expected benefits and costs. This extreme result represents ultra-conservative attitude towards the loss of biodiversity, ozone depletion and global warming. Alternatively, using criteria such as Rawls' distributive justice, utilitarianism and Pareto optimality, it is possible to accept risky innovation according to cost and benefit parameters. Although less extreme than the result of sustainability, these alternative criteria suggest that present generation perspective, including altruism to the future, is not enough to ensure intergenerational justice, so an exogeneous intervention is required.

AB A large survey of animal protein production in sub-Saharan Africa was performed. The objective was to identify specific production needed to ensure sustainable development. Starting from data collection and analysis to gain control of this information, the study proposes possible paths of evolution for supply and demand for animal production. Africa will be the continent where the demand will grow the most (together with Asia), because of demography and urbanization. Urbanization will represent an extraordinary opportunity for the development of animal production. In 2020, the global demand will be 20 million tons per year (7.3 in 1994) for meat, 45 million tons for milk (18.6 in 1994) and 2.9 million tons for eggs (1.1 in 1994). Red meat, which now provides 55.6% of present meat consumption will satisfy only 36.5% in 2020. This underlines the immense effort needed to intensify ruminant production and/or to develop monogastric production. Consequently, there is a need in tropical animal health and research for better knowledge and control of monogastric diseases and particularly those linked to intensification. The development of peri-urban milk production will require particular attention to hemoparasitic diseases. Globally, there is an urgent need to set up projects for the development of animal production.

AB Bovine theileriosis caused by Theileria parva continues to be a major economic problem in many parts of Eastern, Southern, and Central Africa. Due to the unsustainable nature of the present control method-using toxic acaricides to kill ticks-alternative control methods are being sought. Live vaccines are being used in many countries in the region. These vaccines are based on the infective sporozoite stage of the parasite. Sporozoites are inoculated in cattle with simultaneous administration of a long-acting formulation of oxytetracycline. These vaccines are poorly adopted in the region, mainly because of problems associated with the use of live parasites. An experimental recombinant vaccine based on a sporozoite surface antigen (p67) has been developed. Immunization with this antigen induces neutralizing antibodies and, under laboratory conditions, this technique protects approximately 70% of the immunized cattle to a defined needle challenge. The efficacy of the vaccine is currently being evaluated under field challenge in Kenya. Since a vaccine based on a single antigen may not be sustainable under field conditions, a search for schizont antigens that induce protective cell-mediated immune responses continues. It is expected that the ultimate vaccine against theileriosis will incorporate a mixture of several antigens derived from both sporozoite and schizont stages, contributing to robust immunity.

AB The historical reasons for the introduction of tick control during the nineteenth century are reviewed. Background and concepts for the choice between long-term tick control and tick eradication are compared. Case studies of large-scale tick control or eradication programs in Africa, Australia, the United States, and the Caribbean are used to highlight successes and failures. The main reasons for lack of sustainability, or failure, of programs are discussed. These include the economic constraints that were faced in several African countries, or technical shortcomings such as were perceived as a major problem in Puerto Rico. The successes are generally associated with enforcement of appropriate legislation and good management, such as occurred in Zimbabwe. These case studies are analyzed to identify features that may assist in the implementation of the ongoing tropical bout tick eradication program in the Caribbean. The paper concludes with some practical suggestions for the future, and the need to reassess the economics of control and the potential additional animal health benefits derived from tick control programs.

DE PVC waste; thermal treatment; chemical degradation
AB This paper presents a new environmentally sustainable technology for chemical recycling of PVC waste. The new technology transforms PVC waste into completely new chemical products/raw materials. The process is based on a combined thermal and chemical degradation of PVC in a reactor. In the reactor, the chlorine from the PVC reacts with fillers producing calcium chloride. The metal stabilisers (lead, cadmium, zinc and/or barium) are converted to metal chlorides. Exploiting the influence of pH, temperature, liquid to solid ratio and comminution on the metal solubility, metals and calcium chloride are sequentially extracted from the reaction product. This occurs in a downstream multi-stage extraction-filtration procedure. The products from the process are: (1) calcium chloride, which satisfies the specifications as thaw-salt, (2) lead (metal) product, which may be further purified and re-used, (3) coke and (4) organic condensate, which may be used as energy resources for the process. This paper presents the basis of the technology in terms of reaction and separation principles, selected process equipment and process design. Further the economy of the process, environmental issues and product purities/applications are addressed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The concept of sustainable development is gaining ever more interest in the political discussion. However it is often overlooked that this concept has important repercussions for technological development. This is especially true for process industry as this sector is responsible for most material flows within human society as well as the exchange of material and energy with the environment. Based on an operationalised set of criteria for sustainability and on conventional mass and energy balances, the concept of the sustainable process index (SPI) measures the potential impact (pressure) of processes (or more generally 'activities') on the ecosphere. The SPI compares mass and energy flows induced by human activities with natural flows [Krotschak C, Narodoslawsky M. The sustainable process index-a new dimension in ecological evaluation. Ecological Engineering 1996;6(4):241]. As natural flows are always linked to area (examples are the growth of biomass, precipitation and, most importantly, solar radiation) the basic unit of the SPI is area. It is the total surface area that is required by any activity that exchanges material with the environment to be "sustainably embedded into the ecosphere (= environment)". Integrated assessment of processes with the SPI aggregates resources as well as emissions to the three different ecological compartments air, water and soil [Krozer J. Operational indicators for progress towards sustainability (no. EV-SV (T94-0374. EU project final report. Den Haag (The Netherlands), TME, 1996]. The lower the requirement of area for a given activity is, the lesser is the impact of this activity on the environment. The SPI concept allows a quick and reliable evaluation of very diverse processes according to their environmental impact from a sustainable development point of view [Krotscheck C. How to measure sustainability? Comparison of flow based (mass and/or energy) highly aggregated indicators for eco-compatibility. EnvironMetrics, 1997; 8: 661]. It uses data available to a process engineer even at a very early stage in process development and may therefore be used as a tool for optimising processes in the course of their development.

AB A comparison is made of the water efficiency of two types of drip-irrigation systems and one micro- and one flood irrigation system, using nutrient-enriched water, in the production of selected vegetable and maize crops. Results showed the micro- and drip-irrigation systems to be the most economical in terms of water usage. Of these, the drum-drip-irrigation system was the most efficient and probably the system of choice to be developed further for community-based sustainable food production systems in predominantly rural areas of South Africa.

AB Within the last 15 years 34 waste stabilization pond systems have been built in Central America in the countries of El Salvador (8 systems), Honduras (12 systems), Guatemala (9 systems), and Nicaragua (8 systems); these systems were built for municipalities with populations ranging from 5,000 to 80,000 persons. There are 14 additional systems in the final design phase or under construction in the region, including the first designs for large cities: a 162 hectare facultative system for Managua, Nicaragua (population ( 1,000,000); and a 168 hectare system for San Pedro Sula, Honduras (population (640,000). Monitoring data from Honduras and Nicaragua show that treatment efficiency is generally comparable to tropical pond systems cited in the literature in other parts of the world, although fecal coliform removal has not been as good as theoretically predicted and the desludging of facultative ponds has been a significant operational cost. While waste stabilization ponds are generally considered the technology of choice for municipal wastewater treatment within Central America. theta are, nevertheless, problem areas that need to be addressed if waste stabilization pond use is to have continued acceptance and longterm sustainability. These areas of concern at the regional level are: i) design guidelines using parameters from data developed in Central America; ii) effluent guidelines that are realistic for pond effluents for reuse or surface water discharge; iii) monitoring programs focusing specifically on pathogen removal; iv) cost-effective grit removal and sludge removal from facultative ponds; v) improving designs for pathogen removal; vi) the need for centralized (El Salvador and Nicaragua) versus decentralized (Guatemala and Honduras) mechanisms for financing and operation and maintenance; vii) the development of comparative cost data for construction, operation and maintenance, pond desludging, and microbiological monitoring; and viii) the development of training programs for design, operation and maintenance, and monitoring.

AB Research aimed at solving important environmental problems at all scales ranging from global to individual will continue to be an essential part of the process by which sustainability of life on earth may be achieved. Solutions to environmental problems that relate to water are especially critical to this process and are likely to involve use of innovative technologies that emerge from research with sufficient promise to justify their development, a process that evaluates them at a scale that will yield engineering design parameters and confidence in their technical performance and economic value. Privatization of water and wastewater systems and mergers of equipment manufacturers may provide the economic bases needed for development of innovative water and wastewater treatment technologies in the 21 st Century that have emerged from research in the 19th and 20th Centuries but have not as yet been fully developed or adopted.

DE sustainability; water resource; water quality; water scarcity; water
   purification; precautionary principle
AB The water resource is under increasing pressure, both from the increase in population and from the wish to improve the living standards of the individual. Water scarcity is defined as the situation where demand is greater than the resource. Water scarcity has two distinctly different dimensions: water availability and water applicability. The availability is a question of quantitative demand relative to resource. The applicability is a question of quality suitability for the intended use of the water. There is a significant difference in this regard with respect to rural versus urban use of water. In the former case, the water is lost by evaporation and polluted. In the latter case, the water is not lost but heavily polluted. With increasing scarcity, the value of water and the need for controls increase. In this situation, water reuse becomes an option that has been considered exotic until recently. This paper sets the stage with respect to perspective and management options related to implementation of water reuse. Water treatment has to be interpreted as the means by which to purify the water from any degree of impurity to any degree of purity that fits the desired use, including reuse. The historical distinction between processes used in water treatment for water supply versus processes used in water treatment of used water (wastewater) will fade, because it will all be unit processes and operations in combinations to fit the purpose of water use. Water can be purified to any degree of purity - except zero. The challenge of future reuse will be to account for the attitudes related to trace chemicals in water. How precautious is it prudent to be? Risk analysis is no longer an elitist business. It will involve the perception of the public, politicians (and the press).

AB The water sector in Palestine suffers from great damage and serious institutional fragmentation. The deterioration in the water services and the inadequate coverage at the different levels are two major weaknesses in the sector. Adding to that, the responsibilities are scattered among relevant institutions and unclear. Aiming at facing the challenges and obstacles, and in order to approach the achievement of sustainable development in the water sector, the Palestinian Authority (PA) had to take certain measures and actions. The elements of a "National Water Policy" have been adopted that aim at sustaining the resource. However, a set of measures and regulations in line with the policies still has to be issued and enforced. A central independent authority, the Palestinian Authority, was established in order to execute the National Water Policy. The main aims of this authority as a regulator will be represented. This fairly new approach for managing water resources in Palestine is time consuming and requires a big change in the national culture. Public awareness and stakeholder participation are vital strategies to create incentives for public commitment and involvement.

DE rainwater catchment; water supply
AB Early mankind impounded rainfall in rock caverns for consumptive needs. The first farmers situated plots below slopes where runoff could be diverted. Rainwater catchment was an early step in pursuit of sustenance. What is ancient in one respect, however, remains new in another. Rainwater catchment is today employed worldwide for potable and agricultural water supply. Technology is advancing in roofing, guttering and storage, water quality protection and distribution. Catchments abound in both developing and economically advanced nations. Applications include both adaptations to traditional dwellings and modern architecture. Fundamentally more changed than new technology or applications, however, is the viewpoint from which rainwater catchment can be evaluated. Rainwater catchment is a systems problem, a collection of interactive components best understood not as parts. but in their interrelationship. So viewed, rainwater catchment merits consideration as a component of sustainable water resource development. This paper reviews the challenges of rainwater catchment in sustainable development.

AB This work was developed in two stages: initially in water hyacinth ponds under batch conditions (pilot-scale) and later in full-scale ponds under a continuous slate, so as to determine local parameters for the operation of this kind of pond for piggery wastes treatment. Seasonal variations are important features influencing plant productivity and performance. The water hyacinth ponds were able to remove around 50% of the applied organic loads (COD, BOD, TN, TP), even in case of elevated values (110 kg/ha/day) applied for total nitrogen surface loads. An hydraulic retention time of 20 days was shown to be ideal for the treatment. The utilization of water hyacinths as a complement for the animal diet closes the productive cycle in a sustainable way. The results have demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed treatment system.

AB The main aim of the Portuguese-Spanish active bilateral international rivers Conventions (1964 and 1968) was to rule on the sharing of water and hydroelectric potential production of bordering river stretches. The new "Convention on Cooperation for Portuguese-Spanish River Basins Protection and Sustainable Use", signed by the two governments but still to be ratified, envisages co-ordinating efforts on shared river basins management, aiming to attain improved risk prevention and ecosystem protection on those basins, respecting modern principles of international law. An analysis of the new Portuguese-Spanish Convention will be presented, bearing in mind international and European Union law and principles, namely the European Union Water Framework Directive Proposal. Different issues such as water resources development, protection and management of the Portuguese-Spanish river basins, including an envisaged flow regime definition, will be analysed, always according to the legal and political paradigms.

   law; sustainable development; water resources management
AB The need is being increasingly felt within the international community for more careful consideration of the legal and institutional aspects involved in the use and management of water resources. Existing legal regimes, both national and international, may have no provisions for regulating or controlling new needs for sustainable management of waters. Innovative legal frameworks for water must thus be designed to both facilitate and achieve efficient allocation or reallocation of resources for environmental protection and proceed towards the attainment of social, economic and more general sustainable development goals. The no-harm rule, the equitable apportionment principle and the duty of consultation and negotiation among riparian or sharing States are now integrated by rules and standards pertaining to the new branch of international law on sustainable development: the duty of cc-operation, the precautionary principle, the prevention rule, the polluter-pays principle, the environmental impact assessment requirement, which are gaining relevance also in the context of international water resources law, as shown by the 1997 New York Convention on the Law of the Non-Navigational Uses of international Watercourses. Sustainable water management also implies widespread adoption of good governance principles that ensure broader participation in development decisions and an open decision-making process. in developing and using water resources, priority has to be given to the satisfaction of the basic right to water. This paper intends to identify an effective legal international regime for management of water resources, compliant with sustainable development principles solemnly asserted within international law.

DE Maslow's pyramid of human needs; hierarchy of groundwater needs;
   groundwater sustainability management; long-term environmental planning
AB The psychologist Abraham Maslow developed a pyramid of human social needs. A comparable pyramidal hierarchy of groundwater needs can be envisaged. In the pyramid of social needs, until lower level needs are fulfilled, higher level needs remain irrelevant to people. Analogously. only once a society's basic groundwater concerns are fulfilled can groundwater management decision-makers hope to press onwards towards an ultimate goal of attaining sustainable groundwater resources development. Groundwater resources of the Sharon region of Israel's coastal aquifer can be taken as a case in point. To effectively carry out management recommendations for achieving sustainable groundwater development. technical concerns must be integrated with social concerns. Alignment between comparable levels of the pyramids of social and groundwater needs can only be achieved by educating the society to perceive the significance of sustainable resource development for future generations. Only then will the society be fully prepared to pay the price for such development and to participate in the long-term environmental planning required.

DE Palestinian villages; southern West Bank; sustainability; water quality
AB Springs discharging to the Mediterranean Sea drainage systems provide domestic and irrigation water for a group of Palestinian villages in the southern West Bank. Analysis of the water sampled from 70 of these springs at three-monthly intervals from September 1998 to May 1999 determined its suitability for the various uses to which it is put, based on internationally accepted chemical and biological standards. The 1998-99 rainy season was one of the driest on record, causing hardship to those dependent on springs, which diminished in flow or completely dried up. The springs in the area selected have not received the attention their significance deserves. Some of these rural agricultural villages are little removed from subsistence farming. All of these springs are contaminated with bacteria, some dangerously. Chemical pollutants were also observed in many of the springs. There are some rain-fed cisterns, but these too are often contaminated. A few villages receive some water from the network. This study considers the steps which ought to be taken to improve the quality of water, especially drinking water, and suggests possibilities for increasing the amount of water available. It also seeks to determine to what extent these villages can survive as demands for water increase.

AB The concept of driving force-state-response (DSR) framework was used to identify and develop the assessment model of water-land environment carrying capacity (WLECC) for a river basin. The river basin water-land management (RBWLM) decision support system was developed, based on the assessment model of WLECC, as a decision making tool. The Chung-Kang river basin, located in northern Taiwan, was used as a case study to generate a sustainable water-land management strategy. This strategy simultaneously derives the optimal solutions for landuse management, water demand allocation, and water quality management. Furthermore, the sustainable WLECC can also he obtained. The WLECC can be used as the area-based indicator of sustainability to accurately measure the progress towards sustainable development for a river basin.

AB In accordance with the development of tourism, sea pollution has become the major problem of the coastal tones. In order to realize sustainable touristic activities in Turkey, it is very important to treat wastewater and preserve the environmental quality. It is roughly estimated that there are around 2000 small treatment plants in Turkey. However, it is necessary to construct 10,000 more wastewater treatment plants to solve the wastewater problems in small settlements. In this study, performances of small treatment systems were investigated. Two types of the treatment plants were of concern. The first one is a continuous system based on fixed bed activated sludge process, whereas the second system is based on batch activated sludge process. 96 treatment plants have been investigated in this study. The wastewater characteristic is determined as strong domestic wastewater. it has been observed that the effluent quality of the batch activated sludge and aerated biofilter systems meet the discharge requirements of Water Pollution Control Regulation in Turkey. Furthermore, they would be easily adapted to meet the stringent standards that are proposed for sensitive zones.

DE sludge management; life-cycle assessment; sustainable reuse options
AB This analysis suggests that a holistic or life-cycle approach be taken when assessing the longterm sustainability of sludge reuse options, issues such as compliance with world best practice environmental/health standards, energy usage, greenhouse gas emissions, odour control and volume reduction must now be taken into account when assessing the long-term sustainability and public acceptability of the various management options. Four major criteria for the assessment of sludge reuse options are proposed and five management options are assessed using these criteria. The results indicate that traditional land application reuse options must be evaluated in more detail to confirm whether they offer a long-term sustainable management option. Newer thermal based management options may however provide long-term sustainable management options.

AB Sustainable wastewater treatment requires that household wastewater is collected and treated separately from industrial wastewater and rainwater run-offs. This separate treatment is, however, still inadequate, as more than 70% of the nutrients and much of the chemical oxygen demand (COD) and potential pathogens of a domestic sewage system are confined to the few litres of black water (faeces, urine and toilet water). Whilst grey water can easily be filter treated and re-used for secondary household purposes, black water requires more intensive treatment due to its high COD and microbial (pathogens) content. Recently developed vacuum/dry toilets produce a nutrient rich semi-solid waste stream, which. with proper treatment, offers the possibility of nutrient, carbon, water and energy recovery. This study investigates the terrestrial applicability of Life Support System (LSS) concepts as a framework for future domestic waste management. The possibilities of treating black water together with other types of human-generated solid waste (biowastes/mixed wastes) in an anaerobic reactor system at thermophilic conditions, as well as some post treatment alternatives for product recovery and re-use, are considered. Energy can partially be recovered in the form of biogas produced during anaerobic digestion. The system is investigated in the form of theoretical mass balances, together with an assessment of the current feasibility of this technology and other post-treatment alternatives.

AB Weeded check plots are an integral part of most weed control experiments. They provide a measure of the maximum crop yield without weed competition in a given site-year environment. The traditional way to create weeded check plots is to hoc and pull weeds by hand in the row and hoe weeds between rows. But erratic heavy rainfall can prevent timely hoeing. The objective of this experiment was to compare faster, less-laborious mechanized ways to control weeds between crop rows as alternatives to hoeing in corn and soybean. Hoeing, the traditional method for controlling weeds between crop rows, was compared with either repeated mowing using a cord-mower or a string-trimmer or shallow tilling with a rototiller between rows. Weeds growing in rows were controlled by hand-pulling and hoeing because the focus of the experiment was on speeding weed control between rows. All four methods for controlling weeds between crop rows were equally effective when measured as either corn or soybean yield, visual rating of weed control, or weed ground cover in two rears under contrasting rainfall patterns. Cord-mowing or string-trimming between rows was possible when soil was dry enough to walk upon but too wet to hoe or rototill.

AB As part of a large-scale monitoring program linked to the management of kangaroos in the South Australian pastoral zone, the western grey kangaroo populations have been surveyed annually with fixed-wing aircraft over the 15-years-period 1978-92. Western grey kangaroos are restricted in their distribution to the southern regions of the pastoral zone. During the period of the study, western grey kangaroo numbers showed no long-term trends, but did show some marked fluctuations, principally in association with a severe drought. Despite this, and unlike red kangaroos in the South Australian pastoral zone, no consistent, direct association between changes in western grey kangaroo numbers and antecedent rainfall could be demonstrated. The postulated reason for this is that most of the regional western grey kangaroo populations examined in this study were low-density populations at the edge of the range of this species. Outside of drought, these populations are likely to be limited by factors other than food, such as climate and unmodified resources in the form of suitable habitat. Also, because boundary populations may well only be maintained by constant loss and recolonisation, local extinctions associated with drought may result in extended delays in the re-establishment of populations in marginal areas. Over the period 1978-92, these populations were harvested commercially at annual rates of 5-25%, which were, on the whole, considered to be below the rates suggested to be maximum and sustainable.

The traditional cropping systems include the practise burning, sowing by hand, pre-emergence or post-emergence application of herbicides plus repeated hoeing with machetes. These practices result in low weed species diversity, high competitive weeds populations, small crop densities, high erosion possibilities and low yields. This situation is intensified through the increased displacement of perennial crops by annual crops and their cultivation systems. Results of field experiments and farm analysis in Mexico, Nicaragua and Costa Rica demonstrated traditional cropping and weeding practise. Recommendations and examples for more sustainable, integrated weed management under the mentioned conditions conclude the paper.

AB Motor vehicle accidents may cause apart from physical also psychological aftermaths. Despite of posttraumatic psychologic symptoms may remit after 2-3 months, 10-20% of the injured persons will develop sustainable psychopathological symptoms. This report aims at an overview on possible psychopathological disturbances and their perpetuating conditions. Possible treatments are shown and the necessity of an interdisciplinary cooperation with the aim of a secondary prevention is emphasized.

TI Pension scheme in Singapore - Case study and implications
SO ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL WEEKLY

DT Article
AB Recent pension reform literature has appropriately stressed the importance of mandatory pre-funding as an important element in ensuring socially adequate, secure, and sustainable retirement financing. Tit is paper, based an an analysis of Singapore's experience, offers several suggestions for economies contemplating a move from non-contributory to contributory fully funded Schemes. While pre-funding of retirement financing is desirable, to ensure intended results, it is essential to give considerable attention to design, implementation, and regulatory issues. In particular, great care needs to be exercised in undertaking the investment of accumulated funds in a prudent, yet remunerative manner.

ID VEGETATION; RESTORATION; MANAGEMENT; FRANCE
AB French rivers have been transformed by centuries of development to satisfy various social demands such as navigation, hydro-electric power production, flood control, or checking erosion. These modifications have led to impacts that are detrimental to ecology, to resources, and to human interests. In recent years, increased public and management awareness of these problems has given way to new conceptions and objectives in the field of river engineering, among which the goal of establishing sustainable long-term management strategies is of the highest importance. Because many of these problems are directly or indirectly related to changes in the geomorphological functioning of fluvial systems, there is a need to integrate a geomorphological approach into river engineering practices, The principles of "engineering geomorphology" are developed here and are illustrated by examples taken from rivers that drain the French Alps and their piedmont.

AB Europe has a long history of landscape use, ranging from prehistoric to present times. Many old cultural landscapes have high qualities, but the management regime they developed under is no more feasible economically. Modern society increasingly utilizes landscape in a great variety of ways and for many purposes. This poses a complex pressure on cultural landscapes, threatening landscape qualities. Therefore planners and managers are facing the question: how can a sustainable future for old cultural landscapes, based on sound economics and the commitment of all actors be achieved? After a comprehensive overview of landscape use in the past, the various ways in which people have regarded their landscape and the ever changing attitude towards landscape use are reviewed. Modern agricultural practices, urbanization and recreation all threaten the existence of valuable cultural landscapes, but simple solutions to conserve many of these landscapes are not at hand. Perspectives for a sustainable future for historic European cultural landscapes are based on the following observations: society's demand for multifunctionality; the inclination of farmers to meet this demand if it is economically profitable; support from national and local authorities (and the public) for ecologically sound management and finally, decentralization of landscape ruling and legislation, which favours regional solutions. Landscape ecology, as a study of relations on the earth's surface can tackle planning and management issues from numerous view points, each with its own focal points. Scientists from all over Europe, convening in the Netherlands, set out new directions for landscape science. Priorities for the next century include: integration between disciplines; matching of scales in rime and place with users, researchers and decision makers to enhance interaction and understanding.

AB This article discusses some procedural issues relating to a multicriterial assessment of farm sustainability, based on the criteria proposed by the European Union Concerted Action on 'The Landscape and Nature Production Capacity of Sustainable/Organic Types of Agriculture'. Two main problems are stressed: (1) the treatment of basic information used for evaluating farm performances as regards the criteria; and (2) the difficulties in evaluating a case-study farm, Firstly, the problem of implementing multicriterial analyses when using qualitative ordinal data and discrete quantitative data is faced, stressing the importance of clearly defining and applying procedures that can be transferred and repeated. This is due to the fact that almost all research contributions describe in detail multicriterial methods and results, but give little space to the problem of collecting and analysing basic information. Nevertheless, final results heavily depend on the way basic data has been gathered and processed in order to obtain the indices that have been used for the assessment. The lack of standards and of procedure description hampers the comparison of assessments and the possibility to judge their suitability to the aim of farm sustainability assessment. Secondly, the problem of finding external points of reference for judging a case-study farm is confronted. Case-studies can be important as 'models' for other farms. Indeed, it is easier to persuade farmers to adopt farming styles and decisions that somebody else has already successfully implemented rather than to adopt unexplored ways of managing their farms. This asks for reliable methods to assess a single farm, but almost all multicriterial methods only provide a tool for ranking a set of objects, e.g. farms, from the best to the worst. Conclusions provide some comments on the usefulness of these approaches. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B,V. All rights reserved.

ID FARMING SYSTEMS; DEFINITION
AB The objective of this paper is to identify criteria for sustainability at a regional level (intermediate scale) for the evaluation of landscapes. The study site and the criteria were chosen while keeping in mind the situation in Eastern Germany, where the political change in 1989 has had tremendous influence on structures of cultural landscapes. These changes have been investigated in a rural area, north of Leipzig: Dubener Heide, This region now has the status of a nature part, so recreation and nature conservation have been explicitly added to the many functions of the landscape for the socio-economic survival of the people living there. Agriculture used to be crucial in supporting these functions. The rapid decline of agriculture in this marginal area is endangering the income of farm households and adversely affecting nature conservation and recreation. To revive the multifunctionality of the landscape, agriculture as a main land user could be embedded in the concept of sustainability, which itself has to integrate ecological, socio-economic and cultural aspects, There is a vast variety of published criteria for sustainability, but most of them relate to a very small scale (global level) or to a very large scale (field level). To evaluate sustainability on a intermediate scale (regional level), there is a need to derive criteria from the local level by agglomeration and from global level by differentiation.

AB The potential for nature conservation value of unsprayed field margins in intensive arable areas is attracting much attention. The research on this compares the presence of plants, invertebrates and vertebrates in unsprayed and regularly sprayed crop margins, Little is known about the opportunities that grassy field margins offer for nature enhancement in agricultural areas. We present the scope of a research project and some results on the population development of arthropods, mainly insects, in grassy field margins in the Wieringermeer, the Netherlands, paying attention to the implications for farming practice.

AB The role agriculture plays in our economy is changing. The former preference for production is being replaced by a preference for the production of landscape.
   The landscape: we live in has been created by rural tradition. It is the kind of landscape we perceive as pleasant; it is also highly appreciated from the ecological and aesthetic points of view.
   The problem facing us is how we should preserve the character of the rural landscape, which is closely connected with agricultural activity, under conditions of decreasing agricultural production. This question is extremely important in marginal areas whose economy is based on agriculture. Declining agricultural production in these areas results not only in social changes but also in changes in the landscape patterns of environmentally valuable areas.
   One possible solution to this problem is a policy of landscape management. This has been tried out in the Czech Republic, by implementing new types of subsidies in agricultural policy, to encourage sustainable landscape management. Our article seeks to reveal the shortcomings in the functioning of these ecological subsidies in marginal areas. Our qualitative analysis is based on interviews with farmers in Sumava Mountains to ascertain their opinions and experience with ecological subsidies as a new form of state support. The main reason that the ecological subsidies are failing appears to be because they ignore the social factor: the recipient of the subsidy. Most of the subsidies are awarded to businessmen ('new experts') who have no ties with the landscape or with its values and management.
   We conclude that the landscape cannot be managed from outside. We need a living countryside with farmers - recipients of subsidies and the real creators of the landscape. The social situation in the countryside must be taken into account in a broader context. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

DE planning framework; rural area; geo-information system; modelling
AB Problem-oriented planning in rural areas requires a holistic approach in which the different spatial levels are combined within a framework. The highest level of this framework (e.g. a federal state) has to provide general ideas for the development of landscapes. Modified methods have to be used at the regional and local levels, in order to visualise the consequences of different planning measures. Geographical information systems and modelling approaches are very efficient for doing this. The participation of the people concerned, particularly at the local level, has to be guaranteed and integrated within the planning process. Planning in this sense needs not only a top-down but also a bottom-up approach. This paper presents the concepts involved and gives some results of such planning, using the example of Baden-Wuerttemberg in south Germany and examining the regional level (exemplified by an intensively farmed area) and local level (a community) within this federal state.

AB A procedure is presented for restyling the lay-out and management of farms in order to increase the biodiversity in the agricultural landscape as well as the sustainability of farming. The protocol for the development of an on-farm Nature Management Plan explicitly uses landscape ecology characteristics, local biotic and abiotic data and potential, as well as the fanning system data and farmer's personal interests. It may also enhance the farmer's interest and understanding of agro ecological pattern and process and induce a more conscious approach to elements of nature on the farm, which may he the starting point in ecologising agricultural practice.

AB A desk study on current market-oriented approaches promoting more sustainable agriculture compared organic farming (ERO), agro-ecolabelling (AMK), 'environmentally-aware cultivation' (MBT), Albert Heijn's controlled cultivation, Sainsbury's integrated crop management and the TNO label developed for the retailer A&P. The contribution of these to individual Dutch environmental policy themes was analysed. The results of an inventory for arable farming are presented, with special reference to the cultivation of ware potatoes. They show that all the labels include the themes of climate change, acidification, eutrophication and ecotoxicity. The themes of hydrological changes and habitat loss and fragmentation are scarcely taken into account in the Dutch labels. This implies that these labels do not guarantee that sustainable agriculture will be developed. However, the British retailer Sainsbury's does consider all the six topics explicitly. Although both the environment and biodiversity will benefit from a reduction of pollutant emissions, the labels do not assess the actual effect of the criteria, as there is no analytical framework for transforming the present ecolabels into manageable and effective instruments to achieve sustainable agriculture. Several criteria are proposed for use in market-oriented tools aiming to enhance biodiversity. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB During the last 10 to 20 years vaccination has become established as an important method for prevention of infectious diseases in farmed fish, mainly salmonid species. So far, most commercial vaccines have been inactivated vaccines administered by injection or immersion. Bacterial infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria such as Vibrio sp., Aeromonas sp., and Yersinia sp, have been effectively controlled by vaccination. With furunculosis, the success is attributed to the use of injectable vaccines containing adjuvants. Vaccines against virus infections, including infectious pancreatic necrosis, have also been used in commercial fish farming. Vaccines against several other bacterial and viral infections have been studied and found to be technically feasible. Pasteurellosis, streptococcosis (lactococcosis) and infections with iridoviruses are candidate diseases for control by immunoprophylaxis in the near future.
   The overall positive effect of vaccination in farmed fish is reduced mortality. However, for the future of the fish farming industry it is also important that vaccination contributes to a sustainable biological production with negligible consumption of antibiotics. A potential side-effect associated with injectable vaccines is local reactions in the peritoneal cavity,
   The paper presents recent developments in immunoprophylaxis of fish and some problems that should be addressed by the research community in the years to come. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

SO CURRENT SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB The Indian Patent Act is being amended, in part, because of our commitments under General Agreement on Trade and Tariff(GATT), Similar considerations have prompted us to formulate a Protected Plant Varieties Act. At the same time, a National Biological Diversity Act is also on the anvil in response to our commitments to the Convention on Biological Diversity, (CBD), The CBD has advanced beyond the conventional intellectual property rights (IPA) regime to accept the sovereign rights of nations over their biodiversity resources, and the need thereof to share benefits of commercial applications of traditional knowledge of sustainable uses of biodiversity resources with local communities. it is important for India to benefit from these provisions and create a legislative framework that would be a model for other developing countries as well. Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) are now being extended to biological resources, beyond the conventional domain of mechanical and chemical innovations. On this new biological frontier, considerable pertinent knowledge and resources already exist in the public domain, and CBD has clearly accepted the need to respect and share its benefits with these public-domain resources. These considerations must be reflected in the Amended Patent Act. It is also vital that we ensure a proper harmonization of the provisions of the new Patent Act, Protected Plant Varieties Act, and the Biological Diversity Act. In this article we discuss measures for disclosure of country of origin, relevant public knowledge or agreements in the IPR applications under these acts.

AB InAlGaAs/InAlAs superlattice avalanche photodiodes (SL-APDs) have been investigated for use in high bit rate optical communication systems. The high frequency response limitation of high-performance InAlGaAs/InAlAs SL-APDs is reported. For a thin avalanche layer of 0.126 mu m, a gain bandwidth product of 200GHz and a multiplied dark current of 700nA have been attained. These values are sustainable for use in practical systems at 20Gbit/s.

AB The regeneration status of 68 of the most important tropical forest tree species in Bolivian forests was reviewed to elucidate perceived problems with natural forest regeneration and to identify potential silvicultural systems that may help establish adequate regeneration. A wide range of species, important for timber, non-timber products, and forest ecological processes, was reviewed. A. combination of field research, interviews with local experts, and literature searches was used to conduct the assessment. In general, little published information was available on the regeneration ecology of Bolivian tree species. However, based on available sources, regeneration was deemed inadequate for 60% of the species reviewed. particularly acute regeneration problems exist for the most highly valued timber species, many of which appear to need enlarged clearings and subsequent competition control for establishment. Regeneration problems were most severe for shade-intolerant and intermediate shade-tolerant hardwood species. In general, palm species had fewer regeneration problems than dicotyledonous species. Little is known about the specific mechanisms of regeneration failure for many species, but the causes of regeneration failure appear to be varied. This information indicates that solutions to regeneration problems need to be addressed on a species-by-species basis. For many high-valued shade intolerant species, however, successful regeneration may depend on the acceptance by forest industry of non-traditional forestry practices that provide for larger clearings, perhaps followed by post-harvesting silvicultural treatments to control competing vegetation.

AB Soil degradation in the sloping uplands of Asia is a serious problem that threatens the sustainability of agriculture. Although several soil conservation technologies have been developed and promoted, their adoption has not been widespread. A micro-economic analysis of adoption of contour hedgerows by upland farmers in the Philippines is conducted to identify the factors that determine adoption. The empirical results show that adoption depends on several farm and farmer characteristics and the relative importance of these factors differs across sites. The high cost of establishment, maintenance and the loss of land to hedgerows are considered to be the major constraints to adoption by non-adopters. The economics of the contour hedgerow system is found to improve substantially if crop intensification or cash cropping is possible. in addition to the need to develop a range of cost-effective technologies, the study indicates that in the more marginal environments, on-site benefits alone may not be sufficient to justify investment in soil conservation.

AB Improved fallows are the deliberate planting of fast-growing species - usually legumes - for rapid replenishment of soil fertility. Improved fallows are rapidly spreading in several regions of the tropics as a sensible way for in situ accumulation of large quantities of N in vegetation and soil, as well as for providing sustainability enhancing services. Research on improved fallows increased after the mid 1980s with the development of what is known as the second soil fertility paradigm, which is based on sustainability considerations. Many lessons have emerged from short-term improved fallows (< 5 years duration). These include the diversity of farm sizes where improved fallows are used, the advantage of sequential versus simultaneous systems, the utilization of dry seasons unfavorable for crop production, the comparative advantages of woody versus herbaceous leguminous fallows, the magnitude of N accumulation, the strategic use of N fertilizers, and the importance of P. Other key services provided by fallows include fuelwood production, recycling of nutrients besides N, provision of a C supply to soil microorganisms, weed suppression, Striga control, and improved soil water storage. Natural fallows of non-legume shrubs belonging to the Asteraceae family, collectively called 'daisy fallows', may provide lessons for the development of improved fallows. The maintenance of genetic diversity in fallows is paramount. The main limiting factor in Africa is clearly the supply of germplasm of improved fallow species. This must be overcome though large-scale seed orchards and nursery development before impact at the scale of millions of farmers can take place.

AB Shifting cultivation continues as the economic mainstay of upland communities in many countries in Southeast Asia. However, the conditions that historically underpinned the sustainability of rotations with long fallows have largely vanished. The imperative to evolve more permanent forms of land use has been exacerbated by rapid population growth, gazettement of remnant wildlands into protected areas, and state policies to sedentarize agriculture and discourage the use of fallows and fire. There are many compelling examples where shifting cultivators have successfully managed local resources to solve local problems. Technical approaches to stabilizing and improving productivity of shifting cultivation systems have not been notably successful. Farmer rejection of researcher-driven solutions has led to greater recognition of farmer constraints. This experience underlined the need for participatory, on-farm research approaches to identify solutions. The challenge is to document and evaluate indigenous strategies for intensification of shifting cultivation through a process of research and development. This process involves identification of promising indigenous practices, characterization of the practices, validation of the utility of the practice for other communities, extrapolation to other locations, verification with key farmers, and wide-scale extension.

AB Weeds in tropical agricultural systems can cause serious economic damage, and their control often requires the commitment of substantial resources in the way of labor, capital, or pesticides. Tropical shifting cultivation systems employ a fallow period to help overcome weed infestations in addition to improving soil productivity and reducing other pest populations. Short-term, intensive fallow systems that employ herbaceous and woody species to facilitate rapid restoration of soil productivity have evolved as an alternative to long-term fallows. Short-term fallows can impact weeds at all growth stages and play a role in the integrated management of weeds and crops. Fallow management that promotes vegetative soil cover may reduce weed recruitment due to attenuation of soil temperature and/or shift in light quality at the soil surface. Residues or litterfall from fallow species may alter the chemical and microbial ecology of the soil to favor losses from the weed seed bank due to germination, loss of seed vigor, or seed decay. In addition, fallow vegetation can influence weed seed predation. Enhancement of soil productivity should increase the vigor of crop growth and enable crops to better compete with weeds. The burning of fallow species residues may result in weed seed death due to extreme temperatures or may induce seed germination by the release of mechanical dormancy or chemical germination cues. Certain weeds may serve as improved fallow species due to their high nutrient scavenging efficiency in low-fertility environments and their ease of establishment. Short-term improved fallows can be an important component of integrated weed management, particularly by promoting the prevention and tolerance of weeds in crops.

TI Productivity of intensified crop-fallow rotations in the Trenbath model
SO AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
DE fallow period; intensification; soil fertility; sustainability
ID AGROFORESTRY
AB Management of crop-fallow rotations should strike a balance between exploitation, during cropping, and restoration of soil fertility during the fallow period. The 'Trenbath' model describes build-up of soil fertility during a fallow period by two parameters (a maximum level and a half-recovery time) and decline during cropping as a simple proportion. The model can be used to predict potential crop production for a large number of management options consisting of length of cropping period and duration of fallow. In solving the equations, the model can be restricted to 'sustainable' systems, where fallow length is sufficient to restore soil fertility to its value at the start of the previous cropping period. The model outcome suggests that the highest yields per unit of land can be obtained by starting a new cropping period after soil fertility has recovered to 50-60% of its maximum value. This prediction is virtually independent of the growth rate of the fallow vegetation. The nature of the fallow vegetation (natural regrowth, planted trees, or cover crops) mainly influences the crop yield by modifying the required duration of fallow periods. Intensification of land use by shortening fallow periods will initially increase returns per unit land at the likely costs of returns per unit labor. When fallows no longer restore soil fertility to 50% of the maximum, overall productivity will decline both per unit land and per unit labor, unless external inputs replace the soil fertility restoring functions of a fallow.

AB Alpine meadow and shrub are the main pasture types on the Tibetan Plateau, and they cover about 35% of the total land area. In order to understand the structural and functional aspects of the alpine ecosystem and to promote a sustainable animal production system, the Haibei Alpine Meadow Research Station was established in 1976. A series of intensive studies on ecosystem structure and function, including the energy flow and nutrient cycling of the ecosystem, were the main tasks during the first 10 years. Meanwhile, studies with 5 different grazing intensities on both summer and winter pasture have been conducted. In the early years of the 1990s, the research station started to focus its research work on global warming, biodiversity and sustainable animal production systems in pastoral areas. Various methods for improving degraded pasturelands have been developed in the region.

AB Rooted in thousand of years of traditional Chinese agricultural practices and techniques, the Integrated Farming System (IFS) is planned and widely practiced in different regions according to the principles of agronomy, ecology, economics and systems science. Its purpose is to establish agroecosystems with high efficiency and sustainability. Because the Chinese IFS makes it possible to meet the requirements of sustainable agriculture in China, it has been recognized by different levels of governments and by farmers. This paper present an overview of the IFS concept, principles, development, history and current status, classification, typical models, as well as trends for future development.

AB The Loess Plateau with its deep loess and severe soil erosion constitutes a special region of the world. This paper discusses soil conservation, sustainable agriculture, and the prospectives for the Loess Plateau in relation to the Chinese economic development that is expected in the next century. The Loess Plateau region, covers 5 provinces, and stretches over an area of 0.62 million km(2). Erosion has affected 45% of the area, with an average soil loss of 3720 tonnes (t) km(-2) yr(-1). The soil depth is 50-200 m which is typical for undeveloped areas in China. In the past 20 years, the Chinese government has given special attention to the integrated control of soil erosion and development of sustainable agriculture on the Plateau. Sustainable agriculture in this region should be based on rational land use including self-sufficiency in grain production, the protection of woodlands, and commercial fruit trees, and animal industry, in order to make full use of natural resources. Scientists have presented a 28 characters strategy and conservation eco-agriculture criteria for the watershed. Research on water erosion, and on soil and water conservation have led to the development of agricultural systems that are sustainable, Watershed-scale comprehensive management schemes, and reforestation have led to the conservation of water and to improved productivity and an increase in farmers' income. By 2000, the Plateau will be able to produce 50 million tonnes of grain to feed the people in the region. The Plateau with its land resources, agricultural resources, and rich mineral reserves (coal, oil), will play an important role in China's economic development in the 21th century.

AB This paper applies von Thunen's land-use theory with approach to labor location to examine spatial patterns of conservation and land quality. It is based on long-term fieldwork in West Jilin, China, an area that suffers severe land degradation. Statistical data were collected in a four-year project from 1993 to 1997, involving 1,801 fields fanned by 307 families from twenty villages, and analyzed using correlation, regression, and analysis of variance. The distance of labor from agricultural fields is found to be the main contributor to the prediction of conservation and land quality, while effects of market distance are also significant to three of the eleven variables. Nearby fields have more organic inputs, better tree coverage, and better water supply. They are also less affected by soil-exhausting crops and tend to be farmed with traditional environment-friendly techniques. Distant fields are disadvantaged in all these aspects, though they benefit more from crop rotation. As a result, land quality-as measured by depth of soil humus, net income, and farmers' evaluations of land-quality changes-decreases with distance from labor location. Four types of land quality zones were found around labor centers: enhancing, conserving, degrading, and exhausting. The findings imply that agricultural intensification is associated with land improvement in near fields, while it causes land degradation in remote fields. The research calls for further applications of the von Thunen theory and the labor-location approach to environmental problems. It suggests that policymakers need to look at environmental degradation from spatial perspectives, specifically by allowing farmers to live closer to their fields in order to increase conservation and curtail land degradation.

AB Background. At present, myocardial recovery with mechanical support for acute myocarditis is a more frequently observed issue. However, predictive parameters of a sustained myocardial recovery are still under investigation.
   Methods. Two recent cases of mechanical support for acute lymphocytic myocarditis with two different outcomes are reported. Literature about this disease and predictability of a sustainable myocardial recovery are reviewed.
   Results. Acute lymphocytic myocarditis is an individual entity whose outcome is associated with the importance of healed cell damage. Unfortunately, there are no available means of quantifying the fibrotic scar and endomyocardial biopsy has a high percentage of false-negative results. Echocardiographic assessment of systolic and diastolic cardiac function is difficult while under mechanical support and its significance is not obvious. Forthcoming development of Doppler could better correlate myocardial contractility and histology to be predictive of a sustained recovery after acute myocarditis under mechanical support.
   Conclusions. Long-lasting recovery after mechanical support for acute myocarditis remains unpredictable in our experience. More predictive factors are needed. (C) 1999 by The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.

AB The International Association for Danube Research (IAD), founded in 1956 by Professor R. LIEPOLT. was aimed at scientifically uniting western and eastern countries bordering the Danube. Political changes since 1989 and greater environmental awareness have set a new pace in the Danube region and IAD must respond scientifically to survive in an increasingly competitive situation. This paper summarizes the present condition and problems of the Danube, with respect to chemical pollution and monitoring, physical destruction and conservation, major tributaries and catchments, biodiversity anti sustainable development. Although pollution problems remain important, morphological destruction will be the target for future Danube research to ensure the river's ecological functionality and integrity.

TI Tensions in managing the suburbs: conservation versus change
SO AREA
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper reviews the increasing trend for conservation in suburban areas. Focusing mainly on English suburban conservation areas, it explores the background to the movement, the views of residents and the range of town-planning systems used in such attempts to retain the 'character and appearance' of these areas. Concepts of, and approaches to, urban landscapes that might be familiar to urban geographers are conspicuous by their absence. A range of tensions are explored, including those generated between residents and professionals, the values and attitudes of the professionals and the likely future conflict over values and attitudes in conservation versus change: the application of concepts of sustainability, including 'densification' and the compact city.

TI The evaluation of agri-environmental programmes in accordance with
   Agenda 2000
SO BERICHTE UBER LANDWIRTSCHAFT
LA German
DT Article
AB This article aims to merge basic theoretical and methodological evaluation processes with the experiences gained in the first evaluation phase of European agri-environmental measures, and with the planned evaluation framework for the phase to be implemented with the Agenda 2000.
   Within the evaluation theory, five core questions provide a basis for assessment: relevance, benefit, effectiveness, efficiency and sustainability. The issues are presented and a general scheme for the organisation and planning of evaluations is drawn. Additionally, the results of 31 evaluations made by German federal states for the EU Commission were considered in light of the general standards for evaluation. The assessment revealed deficiencies, particularly in the area of evaluation of effectiveness and efficiency. These weaknesses were attributed to inadequate specification and quantification of goals in the program planning, methodological uncertainties in the evaluation of environmental impact, and incomplete EU guidelines on the subject.
   An introduction to recent EU guidelines and ordinances concerning the monitoring and evaluation of the "new" agri-environmental measures is given as background for the development of a concept for the planning and evaluation of measures according to (EC) No. 1257/99. A multi-level process is described that differs from the standard German approach of implementing measures across entire federal states, and rather, places more emphasis on regional or local programmes in environmentally sensitive areas. These programmes make possible both a detailed description of the existing situation, and participation by interest groups, with the goal of determining priority objectives. The gods for the regional agri environmental programmes must be transformed into quantifiable variables (i.e. indicators) to allow for measurement of results and impacts of the applied measures.
   In contrast to program planning, the evaluation begins with the measure itself. At this level, the cause and effect relationships of individual measures, as well as their efficiency are considered. At the regional level, these results can be aggregated into a benefit analysis. Thus, conclusions can be drawn about each combination of measures with regard to the fulfilment of desired goals. Greater goals can be qualitatively evaluated at the programme level, and recommendations for the prospective design and implementation of agri-environmental programmes can be derived on the basis of results from all three levers. For the future development of the evaluation of agri-environmental programmes, close ties between methodological research and the practical implementation of agri-environmental measures are needed to ensure that the most recent knowledge is put to use.

AB The African savanna biome supports a higher diversity of ungulate species than is found in any other biome or continent. This exceptional faunal diversity and herbivore biomass density is directly linked to the high spatial heterogeneity of African savanna ecosystems. The dependence of herbivore dietary tolerance on body size translates into important size-related differences between savanna ungulate species in terms of habitat specificity, geographical range, and the share of community resources exploited. Intact savanna ungulate communities, with species distributed across body size classes and feeding guilds (grazer/browser), have strong regulatory influences on savanna ecosystem structure and function. Replacement with livestock systems of low diversity and high biomass density within a narrow body size range has occurred through the removal of competitors, pathogens, and predators, and the widespread provisioning of water. Overgrazing by livestock, coupled with episodic droughts, has caused widespread rangeland degradation and loss of floristic and faunal diversity which, by current models, is unlikely to recover to 'climax' conditions even with destocking. In selected regions where potential still exists, African savanna biodiversity and human economic development will both be best served by the integration of sustainable wildlife utilization into multispecies animal production systems.

TI Research capacity in UK primary care
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF GENERAL PRACTICE
LA English
DT Article
DE funding; research and development; primary care
AB Background. Moves towards a 'primary care-led' National Health Service (NHS) and towards evidence-based care have focused attention upon the need for evaluative research relating to the structure, delivery, and outcome of primary health care in the United Kingdom (UK). This paper describes work carried out to inform the Department of Health Committee on Research and Development (R&D) in Primary Care (Mant Committee).
   Aim. To describe the extent and nature of current research capacity in primary care in the UK and to identify future needs and priorities.
   Method. Funding data were requested from NHS National Programmes, NHS Executive Regional Offices, the Department of Health (DoH), Scottish Office, Medical Research Council, and some charities. A postal survey was sent to relevant academic departments, and appropriate academic journals were reviewed from 1992 to 1996. In addition, interviews were conducted with academic and professional leaders in primary care.
   Results. Overall, total annual primary care R&D spend by the NHS and the DoH was found to be 7% of the Total spend, although annual primary care R&D spend differs according to funding source. Journals relating to primary care do not, with some notable exceptions (e.g. British Journal of General Practice, Family Practice), have high academic status, and research into primary care by academic departments is, with perhaps the exception of general practice, on a small scale. The research base of most primary care professions is minimal, and significant barriers were identified that will need addressing if research capacity is to be expanded.
   Conclusion. There are strong arguments for the development of primary care research in a 'primary care-led' NHS in the UK. However, dashes for growth or attempts to expand capacity from the present infrastructure must be avoided in favour of endeavours to foster a sustainable, long-term research infrastructure capable of responding meaningfully to identified needs.

TI Survey of recent developments
SO BULLETIN OF INDONESIAN ECONOMIC STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
AB The previous Survey ended on a note of cautious optimism that the Indonesian economy might be on the path to a sustainable recovery. But events in August and September demonstrated how vulnerable the economic recovery still is. Revelations about payments made by Bank Ball to third parties brought into disrepute officials not just in the Indonesian Bank Restructuring Agency (IBRA),but also in Bank Indonesia and the Ministry of Finance; key advisers to President Habibie were also implicated. This and the post-ballot turmoil in East Timer inevitably affected both national and international confidence in the economic recovery. There is growing evidence that the recovery is demand constrained; fiscal policy in 1998/99 was much tighter than originally forecast, and it is far from clear that the predicted deficit in the 1999/ 2000 fiscal year (5.8% of GDP) will eventuate. Real interest rates remain high and there is little sign that investment expenditures are recovering. Although there is now a consensus that the effect of the crisis on poverty and unemployment was not as severe as was predicted in the latter part of 1998, the incidence of poverty increased, and there was a marked rise in the number of workers in agriculture and in the informal sector of the non-agricultural economy. Real wages fell sharply. The social safety net programs implemented in 1998/99 were successful in maintaining rice consumption among poorer families and in preventing large-scale dropouts in the school system. But continuing political uncertainty, combined with the far-reaching decentralisation measures incorporated in Laws 22 and 25 of 1999, led to declining morale among the civil service and a freeze on new policy initiatives. The economic and social policy reform agenda that awaits the new government, led by President Abdurrahman Wahid, is formidable.

This article assesses the effectiveness of this strategy-examining the viability and sustainability of the industry it created-as well as its replicability. If other countries such as China are to emulate Singapore's approach, they will have to develop an institutional framework with the capability to direct the processes of technology leverage and diffusion.

Because management consultants acquire information directly from their customers, for these firms, KM technology exhibits increasing returns to scale. As such, although KM clearly represents an opportunity for some consultants to build a sustainable competitive advantage, it is likely to lead to a shake-out. Based on the industry's early experience with KM systems, this article describes a number of possible future outcomes as well as strategies that consultants can follow.

AB We examine a database of over 700 spawner-recruitment series to search for parameters that are constant, or nearly so, at the level of a species or above. We find that the number of spawners produced per spawner each year at low populations, i.e., the maximum annual reproductive rate, is relatively constant within species and that there is relatively little variation among species. This quantity can be interpreted as a standardized slope at the origin of a spawner-recruitment function. We employ variance components models that assume that the log of the standardized slope at the origin is a normal random variable. This approach allows improved estimates of spawner-recruitment parameters, estimation of empirical prior distributions for Bayesian analysis, estimation of the biological limits of fishing, calculation of the maximum sustainable yield, and impact assessment of dams and pollution.

AB A laboratory scale flow-through model reactor for the degradation of persistent chemicals using titanium dioxide (TiO2) as photocatalyst immobilized on glass beads is presented. In the test system with a volume of 18 L contaminated water is pumped to the upper part of the floating reactor and flows over the coated beads which are exposed to UV-radiation. The degradation of two dyes of different persistance was investigated. Primary degradation of methylene blue did not fit a first order kinetic due to coincident adsorption onto the photocatalyst and direct photolysis, resulting in a half-life of 6 h. A filtrate of a green algae suspension accelerated the colour removal. in contrast, reactive red 2 was degraded only by photocatalysis; neither adsorption nor direct photolysis led to a colour removal. The course of primary degradation followed a first order kinetic with a half-life of 18 h and a rate constant of 0.04 h(-1). Analysis of the degradation products indicated mineralization by detection of NO2- and NO3-, accompanied by a decrease of pH and an increase of conductivity. A successful adaptation of the model reactor (scale 1:10) to dimensions required for surface waters and waste water treatment plants would be a cost-efficient and environmentally sustainable application of photocatalysis for the treatment of industrially polluted water and could be of relevance for third world contries, particularly those favoured by high solar radiation.

ID DESIGN
AB Minimising the environmental impact of a process is an important objective for plant design engineers. It is a goal, however, which is closely linked to the flowsheet structure and, therefore, must be considered at the conceptual stage of the design process. At the same time economic criteria are important for the selection of good designs. Frequently, these goals may result in conflicting designs and compromises are required. In this paper, we describe a multiobjective process synthesis methodology, for the early stages of design, suitable for identifying processes with minimal environmental impact and the desired economic performance. The algorithm is particularly suitable for synthesising bioprocesses and has been implemented in the Jacaranda system, which has been enhanced to consider multiple simultaneous criteria. The synthesis algorithm is demonstrated and evaluated by applying it to the synthesis of a penicillin manufacturing process. The procedure is able to identify a set of flowsheets which satisfy both environmental and economic objectives demonstrating that a multicriteria synthesis tool can be invaluable for design with multiple objectives.

AB The WAR algorithm, a methodology for determining the potential environmental impact (PEI) of a chemical process, is presented with modifications that account for the PEI of the energy consumed within that process. From this theory, four PEI indexes are used to evaluate the environmental friendliness of a process design. These indexes are used in a comparative manner in the process design stage to help minimize the environmental impact of that process. Eight PEI categories (four global and four toxicological) are used in the evaluation of the PEI indexes. Details for relating these categories to known or measured quantities are also presented. An illustrative case study is presented which provide an example for the intended use of the WAR algorithm within the scope of process design and simulation. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB One of the main potential uses of life cycle assessment (LCA) in environmental management is for identifying options for environmental improvements of a system in which complete supply chains are considered. The main problem, however, lies in finding the optimum improvement strategies and choosing the best alternative in a decision environment with multiple, and often conflicting, objectives. To aid the decision-making process, this paper proposes the use of multiobjective optimisation (MO), whereby the system is simultaneously optimised on a number of environmental objective functions, defined and quantified through the LCA approach. This results in a Pareto or noninferior surface, with a range of environmental optima, from which the best compromise solution for improving the environmental performance of the system can be chosen. However, system improvements cannot be based solely on environmental considerations and other factors, including socio-economic, must be considered in parallel. This paper also shows that MO coupled with LCA provides a powerful tool for balancing environmental and economic performance, thus enabling the choice of best practicable environmental option (BPEO) and best available technique not entailing excessive cost (BATNEEC). The value of this approach in environmental system analysis lies in providing a set of alternative optimal options for system improvements rather than a single prescriptive solution, which may be optimal but not necessarily appropriate for a particular situation. A decision-aid tool-optimum LCA performance (OLCAP)-has been developed for these purposes. OLCAP is tested and demonstrated by application to a case study of an existing mineral-processing system producing boron products. It is shown that LCA can successfully be combined with optimisation techniques to satisfy both economic and environmental criteria for more sustainable performance of the product system over the whole life cycle.

AB In the present paper an essential problem in the process industry, the trim-loss problem, is considered. The problem can be identified in many different industries (for instance in the paper and metal industry) but here, the main focus is on the paper industry or more precisely, the paper-converting industry. In the trim-loss problem at a paper-converting mill, an optimal strategy is sought for cutting a wide raw-paper reel into narrower, customer-specified product reels in such a way that the appearance of waste, the trim loss, is minimized. Besides being a numerically challenging non-convex mixed integer non-linear programming problem, the choice of objective is of great importance and a non-trivial task in order to alter sustainable and environmentally benign solutions. Therefore, in the following some transformation techniques for overcoming bilinearity and solving the original problem into its global optimality are presented. The transformations are followed by an analysis and comparison of different ways to formulate the objective function. Finally, a set of example problems are solved in order to project the theoretical considerations to more practical level. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We assessed the degree to which Alaskan lands reflect the state's biodiversity by dividing the entire state into four categories of land protection ranging from highly protected to minimally protected in terms of potential for future development. We then compared the percentage of each ecoregion and plant-cover type in each land protection class. We assumed that 12% protection represents an acceptable minimum and examined the percentage of site records of rare plants in protected and unprotected areas. Of 28 ecoregions in Alaska, 15 (63.4%) have <12% of their area in highly protected areas. Similarly, 11 of 21 vegetation-cover types (43.7%) have <12% protection. For 32 rare vascular plants, an average of 27% of records occur on highly protected lands. Seventy-five percent of the rare plants had <50% of their records from highly protected lands. Less than 1% of Alaska has been permanently altered by human activity. In contrast to the lower 48 states, times remains to plan development that preserves biodiversity while permitting an economically sustainable economy-if the effort is made now.

AB Several captive breeding regimes were compared for their ability to maintain fitness (larval viability) and genetic variation in small populations of the housefly (Musca domestica L.). Populations were either maintained at constant sizes of 40, 200, or 2000 individuals or initiated with two pairs of flies and allowed to grow to 40 individuals (low-founder-number populations). Low-founder-number populations without migration exhibited low larval viability (22%) after 24 generations, compared to larger populations maintained at either 200 (49%) or 2000 (69%) individuals, and suffered high extinction, with only 44% of the lines surviving 24 generations. Low-founder-number populations subjected to two additional founder (bottleneck) episodes, reducing them to two pairs of flies, suffered little additional loss in fitness or extinction compared to the single-founder treatments. Migration as low as one individual per generation (2.5% migration) significantly offset both reduced fitness and rate of extinction. Conversely, fitness was not significantly increased for low-founder-number populations when founders were selected from the top performing 20% of pairs under full-sib mating. Populations maintained at 40 individuals were not sustainable, exhibiting low larval viability (35%) and a high extinction rate (40%) over 24 generations, similar to the extinction rates for populations initiated with only four founders. Although none of the populations maintained at 200 individuals went extinct, their fitness was reduced by 20% compared to a large control population maintained at 2000 individuals. Electrophoretic variation was significantly correlated with fitness across treatments, but the correlation of fitness to narrow-sense heritability of two morphometric trails was not significant.

AB It is necessary to train sufficient number of engineers of the right calibre, for sustainable development. Indigenous technologies are the means by which material things are produced and the artifacts used in a particular culture. Such technologies can be studied by lecturers and used in several ways in the training of engineers. Such efforts can lead to development of these technologies through innovation and thereby result in increasing the productivity of the people who depend on such technologies for their livelihood. It is recommended that indigenous technology be included in the syllabus of the Engineer in society course.

AB This article aims to offer an overview of key issues centred around the relationship between globalisation and transport-related environmental decay in the ecological economics literature of the past decade, followed by an exploration of new research endeavours. The scientific contribution of 10 years of Ecological Economics to issues of environmental sustainability in relation to international trade and transport is certainly not impressive. Hence, also contributions from other environmental economics journals are considered. Two themes which apparently have received less attention in the ecological economics literature are addressed, namely (1) the influence of global trade on the environment and (2) the environmental effects of international transport induced by trade. The total effect of globalisation and transportation on the environment originates from complex changes in the scale, structural, technological and product effects of our industrial system. Various conflicts between global trade/transportation and the environment are pointed out on the basis of these four effects. The paper argues that the net effects of these changes are still uncertain. Ecological economics, however, should contribute to the challenging task of analysing more thoroughly the effects of global trade and transport on the environment. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

SO ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
LA English
DT Article
DE consumption; environment; policy
ID SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; MANAGEMENT; GROWTH; LIFE
AB Consumption ranks with population and technology as a major driver of environmental change and yet researchers and policymakers have paid it scant attention. When the topic is addressed, its conceptual foundations are either taken as self-evident or are conflated with production, overall economic activity, materialism, maldistribution, population or technology. The risk is to adopt the latest buzzword in the environmental debate, stretch the concept to encompass all conceivable concerns, and forfeit any advantage-for analysis or for behavior change-that may accrue to a new perspective on environmental problems. Consumption must be distinguished conceptually from other approaches to environmental problems. One approach is to work within the consumption-production dichotomy, examining not just purchasing but product use and non-purchase decisions. A second approach, one that challenges the prevailing dichotomy and its propensity to relegate consumption to a black box, is to treat all resource use as consuming, that is, 'using up', and ask what risks are entailed. Consumption can then be seen as material provisioning where risks increase with increasing distance from the resource; as background, misconsumption, or overconsumption depending on the social concern raised; or as a chain of decisions that compel the behaviors of restraint and resistance among 'producers'. Pursuing the consumption and environment topic engenders resistance among a wide range of actors for reasons that are personal, analytic, and policy related. Nevertheless, the topic appears to have the potential of helping analysts and others transcend conventional approaches to excess throughput. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper the concept of carrying capacity is investigated to provide an improved understanding about its contribution to solve environmental problems. Light is shed on its form, interpretation and application in biology, demography, applied and human ecology. The analysis begins with an examination of the bedrock of carrying capacity which is Malthus' population theory, and its mathematical formulation - the logistic growth equation. The investigation shows Malthus' thinking to be both political and normative. Furthermore, the rigid assumptions of the logistic equation and the uncertainty of its terms are found not to allow an unequivocal calculation and prediction of the upper limits (carrying capacity) of population growth. It is illustrated that in ecology, carrying capacity focuses on the quality of an ecosystem (pressures on it) and corresponding population numbers, and less on equilibrium of populations as in biology. It is shown that carrying capacity, when applied in fields where human activity or human aims are involved, is a complex normative concept influenced by ecological dynamics, human values and aims, institutional settings and management practices. However, it is demonstrated that the discussion about institutional settings, aims, and values does not take place as much as necessary for its useful application and operationalization in such fields. Instead, authors fall back on sustainability, environmental standards or resilience. The main contribution of carrying capacity in applied and human ecology is as a political concept generally highlighting that exponential growth and thus environmental pressures have to be curbed. Carrying capacity is Ear from being a universal constraint. Operationalization will continue to be hampered as long as agreements are missing about which social carrying capacity is to be opted for and when it is considered to have been transgressed.

ID INVASION
AB We describe a model that simulates use of chemical treatments, mechanical treatments (roller chopping and root plowing), and fire to manage woody vegetation in the Rio Grande Plains of southern Texas and northeastern Mexico. The model consists of two submodels representing dynamics of woody and herbaceous vegetation, respectively. Percent canopy cover of woody vegetation changes as the result of application of management schemes. Aboveground biomass of herbaceous vegetation changes as the result of differences in rates of net primary production, senescence, decomposition, and losses due to grazing and fire. The model is represented as a compartment model based on difference equations with a time step of 1 month. Model predictions of changes in canopy cover of woody vegetation, number of acres required to support a cow, and net production of herbaceous vegetation following application of each of the four treatments are similar to typical 25-year post-treatment response curves for the Rio Grande Plains. Simulation results suggest that the period of opportunity for effective use of fire to manage woody vegetation and sustain production of herbaceous vegetation is longest following root plowing, intermediate following use of chemicals, and shortest following roller chopping. In each case, the efficacy of fire in reducing canopy cover of woody vegetation diminishes rapidly as percent canopy cover increases from roughly 30-50%. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Cost-effective decision making calls for appropriate methods for the modeling, forecasting, and presentation of problem-specific information. This paper discusses the systematic use of remote-sensing derived information to assess the impact of past policies and to support the definition of sustainable European spatial policies through an example of landscape change analysis. A case study of landscape changes along parts of the European coastline between the mid-70s and early-90s is reported, providing an integrated assessment addressing possible causes and effects related to natural and labor resources. The impact of human activities on changes in the natural landscape is discussed both from a qualitative and a quantitative viewpoint.

SO ECOSYSTEM HEALTH

ID HEALTH
AB Change is recognized as being intrinsic to ecosystems, but is also the essence of instability and the outgrowth of situations that lack sustainability. Change is arguably the most fundamental symptom for onset of abnormality in ecosystem function, and change in change cannot be detected without sufficient monitoring to determine spatial and temporal aspects of characteristic change regimes across landscapes. it must also be recognized that change can be associated with either restoration or degradation. A suite of recent developments in change detection using compressed multiband image data provides in-creased flexibility and practicality for systematic change detection on a regional basis. Combining such capability with conceptual extensions of spatial pattern analysis through echelons can provide a methodology for systematically monitoring spatial structure of spectral change across landscapes in order to profile characteristic broad-scale regimes of change and to indicate trends in these regimes. Implementing these analytical scenarios with new generations of computers and remote sensors could lend a further dimension to tracking of ecosystem status over major regions.

AB Real-world problems do not respect the boundaries of engineering or established academic disciplines. This is illustrated by examples drawn from four broad research themes: the Information Society, sustainable development, transport studies and healthcare engineering. These unquestionably represent some of the major challenges of the day. In his Electronics & Communications Divisional Chairman's Inaugural Address, Professor O'Reilly argues that a holistic interdisciplinary approach, with electronics and communications playing a seminal role in the engineering continuum, has enabled real and substantive advances to be made, the total achievements being far more than the sum of the parts.

ID CONSERVATION
AB Rakiura Maori (a tribe of indigenous people in New Zealand) continue a centuries-old customary use of Sooty Shearwater (Puffinus griseus, titi, muttonbird) chicks from islands adjacent to Rakiura (Stewart Island). Some muttonbirders pluck chicks by hand, while others have recently changed to a plucking machine. We compared traditional and modern processing methods to see if new technology stands to increase the efficiency, size and cost effectiveness of harvest. On average, chicks were plucked 6 seconds quicker with a machine, which could potentially increase the catch by up to 4%. Innovation by using wax rather than water to remove down left after plucking saved muttonbirders 29-97 minutes per day, potentially allowing up to a 15% increase in the number of chicks harvested. Both was and plucking machines increased costs, which led to a modest financial gain from using wax, but a net loss from using a plucking machine. Modern technologies have been introduced mainly for convenience and to ease labour in this customary use of wildlife. New technology may erode traditional skills, but does not necessarily pose a risk to the sustainability of a resource. Financial investment in harvest technologies might provide an incentive to increase harvest levels, but could equally provide an incentive to manage for sustainable use. Preservation lobbies are not justified in presuming that new technologies will always threaten wildlife traditionally used by indigenous people.

AB Wetland forest communities are seriously reduced and degraded throughout most of Europe, but significant areas still survive in the east and north-east. Data from 91 forest structures that support biodiversity are analysed in 369 releves of Latvian wetland forests. These structures include variations in topography, stand composition, water movement and dead wood features occurring in semi-natural conditions undisturbed by management. There is clear structural differentiation between coniferous and deciduous wetlands. The study supports the widely held views on European forest quality: low volume of high-diameter (>50 cm) snags and logs, too few overmature trees, and the threat to pattern heterogeneity caused by traditional forestry and silviculture. Twenty areas (totalling c. 3800 ha) are identified as reserves that should be strictly protected in Latvia in order to maintain representative and intact samples of wet forest belonging to Eurosiberian alder swamps (Alnetea glutinosae), broad-leaved forests (Querco-Fagetea) and boreal forest (Vaccinio-Piceetea) communities. Based on habitat features and site ecology, the concept of sustainable forestry must be incorporated widely in utilization of European wetland forests in order to prevent further loss of biodiversity.

AB Bryan Norton advocates using the perspectives and methods of American pragmatism in environmental philosophy. J. Baird Callicott criticizes Norton's view as unproductive anti-philosophy. I find worth and deficiencies in both sides. On the one hand, I support the pragmatic approach, illustrating its use in an argument for sustainable agriculture. On the other hand, I take issue with Norton's claim that pragmatists should confine themselves to anthrpocentric arguments. Here I agree with Callicott's inclusion of nonanthropocentric consideration. However, I reject Callicott's moral monism. In sum, I support pragmatic moral pluralism that includes nonanthropocentric values.

AB Foresighted and determined local authorities, purposeful exploration (i.e. by seismic reflection) and extensive testing led to the discovery of a substantial groundwater resource near the community of Seon (Switzerland) at a depth of 268-305 m. Production tests revealed a hydraulic conductivity of similar to 5.10(-5) m/s, transmissivity of similar to 5.10(-4) m(2)/s and a storage coefficient of similar to 2% in the aquifer. Pumping up to 1500 l/min is sustainable; the water quality complies chemically and bacteriologically with drinking-water requirements. The residence time of several 10(3) years, determined by isotope techniques, guarantees protection from surface contamination. The elevated temperature of 19.5 degrees C of the produced water and space heating. The environmental benefits are substantial: the emission reduction amounts up to 780 tons/year CO2 and 1 ton/year SO2.

AB The optimal intertemporal use of forests is a traditional and extensively investigated topic with recent emphasis on sustainable uses. The political discussion about the clearing of tropical forests adds a topical, policy dimension to this investigation. This study shows that cyclical policies - i.e., clearing is followed by reforestation and then again clearing and so on indefinitely - may be optimal. This possibility, which is due to two things - the growth of biomass, such as trees, and the costs of clearing and reforestation - is overlooked in the corresponding literature. As a consequence, it is possible that present clearing practices, observable in many developing countries, may be an optimal, yet transient policy, that will be followed by reforestation as the developed countries with again expanding forests indicate.

AB The aim of this study was to identify a sustainable cell line and culture method that could continuously provide a sufficient quantity of Toxoplasma gondii tachyzoites to serve the needs of a general hospital laboratory. Three continuous cell lines (HeLa, LLC and Vero) and three cell-culture methods (culture in conventional flasks, culture in membrane-based flasks and an automated culture system) were investigated. In multiplicity of-infection and time-course experiments, HeLa was the cell line of choice. Harvests from HeLa cells had significantly higher tachyzoite yields than those from LLC cells (P < 0.00005) or Vero cells (P < 0.05). Membrane-based flasks gave higher yields (6.15 x 10(6) tachyzoites/ml) than conventional flasks (1-2 x 10(6) tachyzoites/ml) initially, but these were not sustained. The automated cell-culture system was unsuitable for parasite culture. Continuous passage in 25 cm(2) flasks was successful, yielding 1 x 10(6) tachyzoites/ml; viability exceeded 90% after 96-120 h of infection throughout 38 passes, during which time the viability improved and the time to harvest became more consistent. Toxoplasma gondii grown in continuous culture in HeLa cells can provide a regular supply of viable tachyzoites. Demonstration that HeLa-derived tachyzoites could be used for the dye test confirms the potential of this in vitro system for use in general hospital laboratories.

TI Analysing production and environmental risks in arable farming systems:
   A mathematical approach
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
DE agriculture; decision making; risk
AB In response to a growing environmental concern in Dutch society, sustainable production systems in arable fanning have been developed. Amongst other things, a reduction of the dependency on chemical inputs is attempted. This paper addresses the role of risk in the adoption by farmers of new systems by means of a model that determines differences in production risks between conventional and sustainable farming systems (CAFS and IAFS).
   Timing of activities - setting out a management track - is particularly important in sustainable arable farming systems. Resource requirements of crop husbandry activities mainly depend on weather conditions. To assess risks caused by weather conditions, the major aspects of crop husbandry in various crops have been modelled. Using tactics in crop husbandry (decision rules) and weather uncertainty as input, crop husbandry models (HMs) calculate management tracks that require resources. The value distributions of resource requirements of crop husbandry according to different farming systems is calculated in different HMs represented by stochastic dynamic directed networks. Hence, production risks of CAFS and IAFS can be compared.
   On a farm, all the aspects of crop husbandry in the various crops are to be taken into account. Given the weather conditions, tactics for all the aspects are combined in an LP model of the whole farm where they compete for limited resources. In the LP model, tactics are re-assessed by means of the HMS, using information of the LP solution. This iterative procedure enables production risks of OAFS and IAFS to be compared, considering fixed, allocatable resources for the whole farm firm. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

TI Health, transport and the environment - Does European and UK policy
   support effective joint action?
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
DE health; transport; environment; policy; integration; joint action
AB Background: There is growing recognition of the importance of links between health, transport and the environment. Complex interrelationships demand effective intersectoral collaboration and community participation and policy should therefore support this. The UK has a number of key policy documents representing public health, environmental health and transport perspectives, The purpose of this review is to assess how well these policies are integrated and the extent to which joint action and participation are supported. Review: Reviewing global and European influences on UK policy identifies two main themes: the new public health agenda arising from the Health for All (HFA) Strategy and a more traditional environmental health approach. However, there are fundamental aspects in common, in particular the underlying theme of sustainable development. To date, public health and environmental health 'traditions' have been inadequately integrated. This is demonstrated in a number of ways, including approaches to implementation, the choice of indicators and targets and a general failure to define the roles that different sectors can best play in tackling transport, environment acid health issues. The revised national health strategy, 'Our Healthier Nation', places emphasis on local planning through interagency partnership and joint responsibilities, but it remains to be seen how well this will work in practice. Conclusions: Recent years have seen convergence of environmental and public health policies, but further integration is required. National policy could do more to facilitate explicitly local joint action and community participation. Because of the influence that environment and transport issues have on health, national health strategy has a particularly important part to play in achieving this.

TI Large marine ecosystems: An emerging paradigm for fishery sustainability
SO FISHERIES
LA English
DT Article
ID ZOOPLANKTON; ATLANTIC
AB Large marine ecosystems (LMEs) are areas of ocean space with distinct bathymetry, hydrography, productivity, and trophic relationships. On a global scale, researchers have described 50 LMEs; these areas account for 95% of the annual global marine fishery yields. Retrospective analyses of the principal forces driving changes in the yields and sustainability of fisheries biomass have been completed for 33 of the LMEs. Based on the results of these studies, working groups within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and National Marine Fisheries Service have developed a five-module strategic approach for strengthening the links between science-based assessments of changing LME states and socioeconomic benefits of long-term sustainability of fisheries. The modules provide a framework for developing countries to improve assessment and management of LME fisheries, habitat and related pollution reduction needs. The LME projects currently funded or being developed in collaboration with the Global Environment Facility, World Bank, and other international donor agencies represent a broad global spectrum of stakeholders. Included are the ministries of Fisheries, Environment, Finance, and other public and private sector interests of 14 countries in Asia, 20 countries in Africa, 16 countries in Central and South America, and 9 countries in eastern Europe.

AB Human activities over the last three centuries have significantly transformed the Earth's environment, primarily through the conversion of natural ecosystems to agriculture. This study presents a simple approach to derive geographically explicit changes in global croplands from 1700 to 1992. By calibrating a remotely sensed land cover classification data set against cropland inventory data, we derived a global representation of permanent croplands in 1992, at 5 min spatial resolution [Ramankutty and Foley, 1998]. To reconstruct historical croplands, we first compile an extensive database of historical cropland inventory data, at the national and subnational level, from a variety of sources. Then we use our 1992 cropland data within a simple land cover change model, along with the historical inventory data, to reconstruct global 5 min resolution data on permanent cropland areas from 1992 back to 1700. The reconstructed changes in historical croplands are consistent with the history of human settlement and patterns of economic development. By overlaying our historical cropland data set over a newly derived potential vegetation data set, we analyze our results in terms of the extent to which different natural vegetation types have been converted for agriculture. We further examine the extent to which croplands have been abandoned in different parts of the world. Our data sets could be used within global climate models and global ecosystem models to understand the impacts of land cover change on climate and on the cycling of carbon and water. Such an analysis is a crucial aid to sharpen our thinking about a sustainable future.

ID INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; PATENT; LAW
AB Biodiversity loss is one of the major international environmental problems. This paper analyses the question of how the use of genetic and biochemical resources in biotechnological industries might affect biodiversity conservation. It is argued that the answer will significantly depend on the concrete regimes of property rights on genetic resources and related biotechnological knowledge. One of the main conclusions derivable from this analysis is that a tightening of intellectual property rights may either aggravate biodiversity loss or strengthen biodiversity conservation, depending on various conditions. This result has interesting parallels to the results of second best theory. Furthermore, it sheds new light on the debate regarding the relationship between the WTO Agreement on trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights (TRIPs) and biodiversity loss.

AB This paper describes planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation activities carried out in support of a malaria control project that used permethrin-impregnated curtains in eight villages in rural Malawi. Findings from formative evaluation and project monitoring aspects of the evaluation are presented. Permethrin-impregnated curtains were introduced to villagers who participated in household self-help projects. To implement the project, village health workers were trained and worked closely with existing project personnel as well as traditional headmen to assure village participation, facilitate health education and coordinate curtain-dipping (impregnation) meetings. A quasi-experimental evaluation design used surveys and observations to measure change in cognitive, behavioural and health outcome indicators. Village adoption rates averaged 50%, with variation between villages. Monitoring data showed a high degree of compliance with curtain re-impregnation initially and high perceived efficacy of curtains. Issues discussed include village readiness for change, trust, acceptability of the innovation, cost, sustainability and leadership.

TI Health for some? The effects of user fees in the Volta Region of Ghana
SO HEALTH POLICY AND PLANNING
LA English
DT Article
ID CARE; EXPERIENCE; AFRICA
AB This paper reports key findings and conclusions from a 1996 study of user fees and exemptions in the Volta Region of Ghana. A variety of data sources and methods were used, including interviews with patients and managers, community-based focus group discussions, analysis of facility records and analyses of previous household survey data.
   Official fee levels and exemption categories were established in 1985. While this legislation made provision for drug fees to be 'at cost' and thus to be revised in line with inflation, other official fees have not been adjusted since 1985. in the face of declining real levels of budget allocations and decreased supplies of essential consumables from the Central medical stores, facility managers have established their own pricing and fee collection systems. This has been allowed by the Ministry of Health, but the decentralized nature of fee setting and collection practices has made it very difficult for the Ministry to monitor the effects of fees.
   The study found that facility managers have been very active in setting a nd collecting fees and using the revenues to purchase essential inputs. The level of revenues being mobilized accounts for between two-thirds and four-fifths of the non-salary operating budget of government health facilities, and virtually all of the resources for non-salary operating expenses in mission hospitals.
   Official exemptions are largely non-functional. Less than one in 1000 patient contacts were granted exemption in 1995. With estimates that between 15 and 30% of the population lives in poverty, the failure of exemptions to function means that fees are preventing access for the poor, or are imposing significant financial hardships on this part of the population.
   Health facilities in the Volta Region have achieved a kind of 'sustainable inequity', with fees enabling service provision to continue, while concurrently preventing part of the population from using these services.

TI National Health Accounts development: lessons from Thailand
SO HEALTH POLICY AND PLANNING
LA English
DT Article
ID DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES
AB National Health Accounts (NHA) are an important tool to demonstrate how a country's health resources are spent, on what services, and who pays for them. NHA are used by policy-makers for monitoring health expenditure patterns; policy instruments to re-orientate the pattern can then be further introduced. The National Economic and Social Development Board (NESDB) of Thailand produces aggregate health expenditure data but its estimation methods have several limitations. This has led to the research and development of an NHA prototype in 1994, through an agreed definition of health expenditure and methodology, in consultation with peer and other stakeholders. This is an initiative by local researchers without external support, with an emphasis on putting the system into place. It involves two steps: firstly, the flow of funds from ultimate sources of finance to financing agencies; and secondly, the use of funds by financing agencies. Five ultimate sources and 12 financing agencies (seven public and five private) were identified. Use of consumption expenditures was listed under four main categories and 32 sub-categories.
   Using 1994 figures, we estimated a total health expenditure of 128 305.11 million Baht; 84.07% consumption and 15.93% capital formation. Of total consumption expenditure, 36.14% was spent on purchasing care from public providers, with 32.35% on private providers, 5.93% on administration and 9.65% on all other public health programmes. Public sources of finance were responsible for 48.79% and private 51.21% of the total 1994 health expenditure. Total health expenditure accounted for 3.56% of GDP (consumption expenditure at 3.00% of GDP and capital formation at 0.57% of GDP). The NESDB consumption expenditure estimate in 1994 was 180 516 million Baht or 5.01% of GDP, of which private sources were dominant (82.17%) and public sources played a minor role (17.83%). The discrepancy of consumption expenditure between the two estimates is 2.01% of GDP There is also a large difference in the public and private proportion of consumption expenses, at 46:54 in NHA and 18:82 in NESDB.
   Future NHA sustainable development is proposed. Firstly, we need more accurate aggregate and disaggregated data, especially from households, who take the lion's share of total expenditure, based on amended questionnaires in the National Statistical Office Household Socio-Economic Survey. Secondly, partnership building with NESDB and other financing agencies is needed in the further development of the financial information system to suit the biennial NHA report. Thirdly, expenditures need breaking down into ambulatory and inpatient care for monitoring and the proper introduction of policy instruments. We also suggest that in a pluralistic health care system, the breakdown of spending on public and private providers is important. Finally, a sustainable NHA development and utilization of NHA for planning and policy development is the prime objective. International comparisons through collaborative efforts in standardizing definition and methodology will be a useful by-product when developing countries are able to sustain their NHA reports.

AB The demand for blood transfusion is high in sub-Saharan Africa because of the high prevalence of anaemia and pregnancy related complications, but the practice is estimated to account for 10% of HIV infections in some regions. The main response to this problem by the international donor community is to establish vertically implemented blood transfusion services producing suitable (safe) blood at a cost of US$25-40 per unit. However, the economic sustainability of such interventions is questionable and it is argued here that hospital-based blood transfusion services operating at a basic adequate level are sufficient for low-income African countries. The results of a project aimed at improving such services in Tanzania are presented. The main findings are: (1) the cost per suitable blood unit produced was US$12.4; (2) at an HIV test sensitivity of 93.5% during the study period, discounted financial benefits of the interventions exceeded costs by a factor of between 17.2 and 37.1; (3) the cost per undiscounted year of life saved by use of these interventions was US$2.7-2.8; and (4) safe blood transfusion practices can be assured at an annual cost of US$0.07 per capita. Recommendations are made to ensure safe blood transfusion practices at hospital-based blood banks in Tanzania.

ID PROGRAM; PROJECT; STATE
AB The Life Abundant Programme (LAP), a church-sponsored primary health care project in rural Cameroon, was founded on the principles of community participation and self-reliance. Beginning in 1980 in four villages, the project is now active in 40 Primary Health Centres and 14 Integrated Health Centres. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the sustainability of the first 16 LAP-associated Primary Health Centres after 17 years of field practice, and to share lessons learned from that experience. After 9 years, 13 (81 %) communities were active; and after 17 years, 14 (87.5%) were active. Village factors contributing to sustainability include community management of their own health programs, community financial self-reliance, village integrity in money management, annual continuing education for all health workers, and continuing support by Project staff: Factors contributing to sustainability at the Integrated Health Centre level are: receipt of adequate fees from patient curative services; the clinical expertise of health workers as well as their positive relationships with the community people; and continuing medical and LAP support. At the Project Administrative level, factors include adequate staffing, a close working relationship with government health authorities, and financial support from within the country as well as continuing donor agency support from outside. At all levels of LAP activity, commitment to the Biblical philosophy of love, compassion and integrity contribute to sustainability.

AB Healthy Cities and Local Agenda 21 both offer strategic frameworks for the development and implementation of theory and practice in the related fields of health promotion/public health and sustainable development. Whilst the close links between health and sustainable development are widely acknowledged, the two frameworks continue to operate largely in parallel. This paper reviews concepts of health and sustainable development, and relates the evolution of thinking that has taken place to the historical development of the Health for All (HFA) and Agenda 21 movements. It is argued that towns cities and communities committed to promoting health and sustainability face two key challenges as they approach the new millennium: how to move from the margins to the mainstream; and how to integrate the frameworks. Discussions from a recent national 'round table' meeting are used to illustrate a range of key issues and highlight implications for people working at local, national and international levels.

AB Scenarios for the 21st century range from technology and business-oriented visions of a global boom to more pessimistic ones based on increasing environmental degradation, poverty with a rising gap between rich and poor, and societal breakdown. Drawing on his own views and those of 53 other anthropologists, the author discusses the likelihood of the more pessimistic vision prevailing if present trends continue.

AB Although this manuscript was prepared for a specific region, the North American Great Lakes, the major elements are important to the quest for sustainable use of the planet anywhere in the world. Since sustainability will often involve an eco-region that consists of more than one political entity, a bio-regional entity will be essential. The unifying theme is the intent to leave a habitable planet for future generations. In order to accomplish this, a consilience (literally leaping together) of the social and natural sciences is essential. When one considers the often bitter fragmentation of human society in many parts of the world and the isolation of disciplines in educational institutions, consilience seems visionary and utopian. But, visions of a better future can be very powerful and produce major paradigm shifts. The future of human society depends on the development of robust sustainability initiatives for Earth's bioregions. This 'futures studies' manuscript explores the broad outlines of such an undertaking.

TI Water flow pathways and the water balance within a headwater catchment
   containing a dambo: inferences drawn from hydrochemical investigations
SO HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES

ID GROUNDWATER; HYDROLOGY; CHEMISTRY
AB Dambos, seasonally saturated wetlands, are widespread in headwater catchments in sub-Saharan Africa. It is widely believed that they play an important role in regional hydrology but, despite research conducted over the last 25 years, their hydrological functions remain poorly understood. To improve conceptualisation of hydrological flow paths and investigate the water balance of a small Zimbabwean catchment containing a single dambo, measurements of alkalinity and chloride in different water types within the catchment have been used as chemical markers. The temporal variation in alkalinity is consistent with the premise that all stream water, including the prolonged dry season recession, is derived predominantly from shallow sources. The proposition that dry season recession flows are maintained by water travelling at depth within the underlying saprolite is not substantiated. There is evidence that a low permeability clay lens, commonly present in many dambos, acts as a barrier for vertical water exchange. However, the highly heterogeneous chemical composition of different waters precludes quantitative hydrograph splitting using end member mixing analysis. Calculation of the chloride mass-balance confirms that, after rainfall, evaporation is the largest component of the catchment water budget. The study provides improved understanding of the hydrological functioning of dambos. Such understanding is essential for the development and implementation of sustainable management strategies for this landform.

AB Within the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna there has not been agreement on a mechanism for adjusting quotas for the resource. It has been proposed that development of a decision-rule-based management strategy is an issue of high priority, indeed a matter of urgency. Results are presented from an initial application of a Monte Carlo management strategy evaluation (MSE) approach aimed at developing a rebuilding strategy for the stock. Southern bluefin tuna (Thunnus maccoyii) provides a substantial test of the power of this approach to develop a decision framework that can cope with large uncertainties about the current state of the stock and conflicting information from the fishery that is used in stock assessment. The results indicate that a robust feedback decision-making framework can be developed which ensures fast rates of recovery across the broad range of interpretations about stock dynamics and current status of the resource. Among the harvest strategies examined, the F(0.2), F(0.1), and SSB/R strategies were clearly the most robust and consistent in terms of recovery and sustainability. Fast recovery rates were only achieved with strategies that had catches substantially below 1998 levels. Within the strategies examined, little scope exists for improvement in yield without a direct loss in recovery performance. For the MSE approach to succeed, the operating, sampling, and conditioning model components must incorporate the full uncertainty about the real stock and the sampling processes appropriately. There is clearly scope for improving and broadening the way uncertainties have been handled in this initial examination. In particular, uncertainties associated with the catch-at-age, the relationship between the c.p.u.e. and true abundance, and the conditioning of the historical population sizes in the face of inconsistent historical data, need further development. As the MSE approach requires conditioning to historical data, full and appropriate incorporation of uncertainty into stock assessment and conditioning would lead to a better basis for developing and evaluating management procedures that will work.

DE increased harvest; increased recruitment; larger stock; low exploitation
   rate
AB The Icelandic summer-spawning herring stock collapsed during the late 1960s as a result of a combination of high fishing pressure and deteriorating environmental conditions. Following a moratorium on fishing the stock, a small fishery of about 10 000 t started in 1975. From analyses of several harvesting strategies it was decided to recommend fishing at or near F-0.1. When the fishery was reopened it was managed by individual non-transferable quotas per boar that gradually developed into an individual transferable quota (ITQ) system. The development, the implementation. and the effect of the harvesting strategy and the management system are discussed and evaluated. Results indicate that a strategy of catching 20% of the adult stock biomass (3-ringers and older) would be useful from the point of view of achieving an optimal sustainable harvest from the stock without risking stock depletion. This is not markedly different from the current exploitation strategy, which has now been very successful for almost a quarter of a century.

   Act
AB The passage of the Sustainable Fisheries Act (SFA) by the US Congress in 1996 fundamentally changed the approach to fisheries management in the United States. While an objective of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson-Stevens Act), the US Federal law controlling fisheries management in the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), had always been to prevent overfishing, the attendant mechanisms for accomplishing the objective were not included in law. Some of the most significant amendments of the SFA were the addition of three new national standards, against which all proposed fishery conservation and management measures are measured, and the amendment of several other existing standards. Among the most important changes from the standpoint of conservation were changes that relate to national standard 1, regarding the prevention of overfishing and the rebuilding of overfished resources. Although the SFA did not use the term "precautionary approach" explicitly, the concept is implicitly expressed in several provisions of that Act. In developing the guidelines for implementation of the national standards, the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) incorporated precautionary concepts to ensure that compliance with the SFA's measures to prevent and end overfishing are satisfied. In addition, the NMFS developed Further technical guidance to assist fishery scientists and managers in providing advice that appropriately considers risk, relative to the scientific information available, such that meaningful protection is afforded marine stocks and stock complexes. Such protection extends not only to consideration of stock recruitment, but also to maintenance of sustainable levels of stock biomass and biodiversity.

AB Any form of management adopted for species, ecosystems, or the biosphere must: (1) be consistent with management at other levels of biological organization; (2) account for reality, including the uncertainty of what we do not, or cannot, know, (3) result in living systems within their normal ranges of natural variation; (4) exercise precaution and consider risk in achieving sustainability; (5) be information-based and interdisciplinary: (6) include monitoring and assessment; (7) have clear goals and standards of reference; (8) be limited to controlling human activities; (9) include humans among the components of ecosystems and the biosphere. These nine objectives can be met simultaneously. The form of management that does so is described in this paper in its application to multi-species fisheries. It also applies in the management of fisheries harvesting from single populations, species, ecosystems or the biosphere. Such management would be based on empirically observed sustainability. In this paper, it is demonstrated how sustainable consumption from two groups of species in separate ecosystems is exemplified by the predators that feed on them. Such empirical examples are the result of a wide variety of factors, including the trial-and-error processes of evolution and various risks, including extinction, that impose limits. Implications for management are clear. Consumption rates by humans have been much too high and would have to be reduced significantly to match empirically proven sustainability at its maximum. Commercial takes of fish are far above the mean rates of consumption observed among predatory species in nature. It will be extremely difficult to implement the management that appears to be necessary. Nevertheless, consumption rates beyond the naturally observed limits have not been proven to sustainably avoid long-term risk. (C) 1999 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

AB Australian legislation requires Commonwealth fisheries to be managed according to the principles of ecologically sustainable development. This imposes a complex set of potentially conflicting, multiple objectives on the management agency. The Bureau of Rural Sciences, a professionally independent scientific bureau within the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Forestry, has developed a framework for specifying these objectives and evaluating progress over time using a variant of multi-criteria analysis. The framework allows trade-offs to be recognized, compared, and integrated. It involves a hierarchical structure of objectives that can be developed to any level of detail desired. There are at least three ways in which uncertainty can be incorporated into or investigated by the framework. First, objectives at any point in the hierarchical structure can be specified and evaluated in terms of probabilities. Second, subjective weights can be used to quantify and explore the consequences of individuals attaching different values to particular objectives. Third, the framework itself can be the basis for evaluating performance of different management systems using Monte Carlo or other modelling techniques. Sensitivity to subjective weights is illustrated with a case study of the south-east fishery, a multi-species trawl fishery providing much of the fresh seafood to south-eastern Australia. The framework is proving to be a flexible evaluation tool as it is applied to the major Australian Commonwealth fisheries. (C) 1999 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

ID CO-MANAGEMENT
AB In South Africa, as fisheries management continues to move through a transformation process, it is confronted with a myriad of uncertain scenarios which have the potential to jeopardize its objectives. One such situation, which has proved to be threatening to the sustainable utilization of marine resources, is illegal exploitation. In recent years, South Africa has witnessed an increase in poaching activities, with a particular emphasis on the lucrative abalone industry. This fishery has existed successfully for almost 50 years, with an average annual catch in the past 10 years of 615 tonnes. Dramatic cuts in the total allowable catch since late 1996, with up to 90% reductions in key areas, have placed the long-term sustainability of the fishery in question. A criminological study of abalone poaching in a community where both the legal and illegal industries are centred has clearly illustrated both the severity and the complexity of the problem. Negative ramifications have spread through several spheres, incorporating environmental, social, economic, and political dynamics. From the perspective of the community, where poaching is rife, this study highlights the impact poaching has had on a local level, representing significant obstacles for successful fisheries management. The de-legitimization of regulations, the mistrust and corruption of authorities, the bitter and often violent conflict between resource users and the increased fear within the community exacerbate the challenges for cooperative management structures. Although there has been a historic reliance on law enforcement and crime control to address the problem of illegal exploitation, it has been recognized that a shift in governance needs to take place. However, such a shift will require extreme measures that consider the broad issues discussed above. (C) 1999 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

ID SCIENTIFIC INQUIRY
AB Management science, the scientific study of problem-solving, has developed a body of literature and methodologies over the past four decades on decision theory methods, evaluation of management and systems performance, and analysis of systems under uncertainty. These methods have been influential and applied successfully to many industrial decision-making and strategic-planning settings. Fisheries management has not yet embraced these innovations, which involve the "scientific method of problem-solving" and which offer considerable opportunity for improved fisheries decisionmaking. Fisheries science and management can be integrated with management science in what we term "fisheries-management science". The broader framework allows management in the face of uncertainty and, at the spatial and temporal scales, is appropriate for the complexity of fisheries systems. This paper presents an implementation plan for fisheries-management science in a commercial fishery. The implementation plan is presented as a possible remedy for issues that have plagued fisheries management to date. It is argued that decision theory methodologies are needed to analyse the management problem context, including strategic planning and objectives setting, appropriate spatial and temporal scale definition, interdisciplinary systems modelling methods, the assessment and management of risk, and ongoing in-season decision-monitoring. The fisheries-management science problem-solving context also provides a basis for reshaping the central agency responsible for fisheries into a more action-orientated organization consisting of multidisciplinary teams acting in support of participative, real-time decision-making through enhanced industry and stakeholders' responsibility for resource sustainability. Fisheries institutions are often hindered by rigid, disciplinary organizational structures and decision-making processes that are unable to account, in a timely fashion, for the multiple and conflicting objectives and the inherent variability that characterize a fishery system. The fisheries-management science approach addresses these issues by focusing on the problem-orientated nature of fisheries management, by managing according to objectives, and by supporting a holistic view for stock conservation and resource sustainability.

AB A relationship of nitrogen, sulphur and calcium for sustainable production of Indian mustard [Brassica juncea (L.) Czernj. 8 Cosson] on denuded sandy-loam soils was investigated, during winter seasons of 1993-94 and 1994-95. 'Varuna' Indian mustard was tested under 5 levels of nitrogen (0, 40, 80, 120 and 160 kg/ ha) and 3 levels of sulphur + calcium (S-o + Ca-o, S-25 + Ca-50 and S-50 + Ca-100 kg/ha). Use of nitrogen in nutrients denuded soils established a strong relationship for grain production of Indian mustard. Branches, pods, pod weight, seeds weight/ plant and 1,000-grain weight increased significantly with each successive increase in the level of N from 0 to 160 kg and S from 0 to 50 + Ca from 0 to 100) kg/ha. The increase in the yield after 120 kg Nka was significant by a margin of 3.79 q/ha or 13.07% with higher dose of 160 kg N/ha. The use of 50 kg S + 100 kg Ca/ha also increased grain yield by a margin of 1.99 q/ha or 8.35 % and 3.33 q/ha or 14.75% over 25 kg S + 50 kg Ca/ha and the control respectively. The significant maximum yield by 34.87 q/ha was reaped with the use of 160 kg N + 50 kg S + 100 kg Ca/ha.

AB Water is arguably the most critical of all resources, and its sustainable development is essential to any sustainable society. Current increases in demand, coupled with climate change-induced uncertainty over supply, means that UK water resources are closer to sustainability limits than ever before. Demand management is increasingly viewed as a key element of a sustainable water resource strategy, but must be supported by accurate demand forecasts, preferably those that address micro-scale multi-component demands as these can provide better information on which optimal decisions about water allocation can be made. However, good demand forecasting in itself is not sufficient to promote the sustainable use of water resources. The implications of demand, and strategies to manage that demand must also be considered, notably in the equitable allocation of supplies between future and current users, between current social groups, and the needs of the environment. This paper describes the development of a forecasting package that integrates microsimulation and econometric models to produce small area forecasts of water demand for Yorkshire, UK, and discusses how the demand estimations may be developed to address sustainability issues with respect to future generations, disadvantaged social groups and the environment.

ID GEOGRAPHY
AB The role of spatial scale in sustainable development is assessed by dividing the world into multiple spatial units at different levels on a socio-political spatial scale. The basic patterns of sustainable development do not appear to be evident at all spatial levels, owing to the absence of some capital stocks and the conversion processes linking them, but environmental economics theory can be generalized to explain phenomena at various levers. Capital conversion processes influencing the sustainability of development of spatial units are constrained by processes at different levels, e.g. those imposing environmental conditions on development or affecting availability of investment capital. The autonomy of individual spatial units is also compromised by capital transfers to and from other units at the same lever, so it is proposed that the sustainability of development of a particular unit should be estimated using net, rather than gross capital trends. Because of uneven development the same degree of sustainability should not be expected at the same time for all spatial units at the same spatial level.

AB A study of social attitudes to urban energy management strategies has been undertaken as part of a research project aiming to develop an energy planning tool for urban planners. The study used a social survey to predict attitudinal responses to Proposed engineering solutions, namely load management, energy efficiency and alternative supply options (renewable energy). The principal influence on attitude formation, which emerges from the literature and this study, appears to be socio-economic conditioning.
   The results indicate that Leicester citizens are open to alternative energy strategies, such as a willingness to pay additional amounts of money for electricity generated from renewable or sustainable sources and the purchase of low energy appliances. Over half the sample surveyed would pay up to 5% extra for an energy-efficient appliance, and a significant minority would pay extra for 'green' energy. In addition, 73% of respondents are sympathetic to Demand-side Management measures such as interruptible tariffs. The use of 'social group' analysis has proved to be a useful and sensitive tool for the market analysis of energy-related behaviour. In this study, a positive relationship between energy-related attitudes and income is revealed.

AB Changes in the directions of transport policy in the UK in the last few years have led to a wider consideration of possible measures to bring about behavioural change, in particular measures which have the potential to reduce car dependence. Among the measures currently being implemented by local authorities are public awareness or travel awareness campaigns. This paper examines the findings of a research project which evaluated a travel awareness scheme in the context of an integrated transport policy. The research project monitored the attitudes, beliefs and intentions of a sample of the residents who had been targeted by the Maidstone Initiative for Sustainable Transport (MIST) implemented by Kent County Council and Maidstone Borough Council. The research project found some remarkably consistent attitudes about car and bus travel over a period of three years. It also found that whilst people seem to be aware of the impact of travel on the environment they do not consider the environmental impact with the same degree of importance as other attributes of travel. A further finding was a hidden desire to switch modes from the car. The paper will conclude by looking critically at the future for travel awareness campaigns.

AB Transport strategies have been developed for nine European cities to achieve optimum performance in terms of a range of objective functions. The functions selected represent economic efficiency, sustainability and a combination of these. The strategies have been based on combinations of a standard set of policy instruments, including public transport infrastructure, frequency and fares, road capacity increases, low cost road pricing and parking charges. The optimisation method is described, and results presented. The reactions of city authorities to the proposed strategies are discussed and implications for transport policy outlined.

TI Making livelihoods more sustainable
SO INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL SCIENCE JOURNAL

DT Article
AB The concept of sustainable livelihoods (SL) has emerged over the last decade, with growing legitimisation through several major international fora including the World Summit for Social Development. The sustainable livelihoods approach is an operational vehicle for sustainable human development, offering both a policy and a programming framework for poverty reduction in a sustainable manner. The concept, being eclectic in nature, has been interpreted in a number of different ways and its evolution is discussed in this article. Governments, non-governmental organisations, donors and communities are currently applying the SL concept and various tools and methodologies have been developed for the design, implementation and evaluation of SL programmes at the country level. The article also examines the constraints commonly faced in the implementation of the SL concept and ends with a discussion of recommendations for future action in the area of SL policy development and programming. The stage is now set for building on the growing momentum by the UNDP, bilateral partners, development banks, foundations, research institutions, policy think-tanks and civil society organisations to make a global shift to a sustainable livelihoods approach for poverty reduction.

TI The social basis of international cooperation
SO INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL SCIENCE JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB Many areas of pressing global concern can be addressed successfully only through international collective action. But can effective and efficient solutions be found if questions of distribution, equity and justice are side-stepped? The liberal tradition assumes that some combination of international cooperation and coercion to produce global public goods is possible, even on the basis of self-interest alone. This article argues that equity must be at the core of a framework for international cooperation. The potential value of equity may be considered at three different levels. First, equity and justice promote cooperative behaviour, itself needed for the provision of public goods. Although social cohesion may not be an absolute precondition in the supply of public goods, its value lies in making cooperation easier and giving global rules greater legitimacy and sustainability, Second, when the system is perceived to be fair and equitable, nations will participate in it willingly; otherwise, their contributions individually and collectively will tend to be insufficient to make the system work well, or at all. Third, global equity is itself a public good that, without cooperation or coercion, may be under-supplied.

DE sustainable development; environmental external effects
AB Since the "Earth Summit" in Rio de Janeiro 1992 the term "sustainable development" determines the third and current phase of environmental policy. A precise and commonly accepted definition of sustainable development (s.d.) is still missing. There are, nevertheless, some elements in the philosophy of sustainable development which-even if they are still vague-could be used as guidelines for a framework of "green" accounting and sustainability indicators. Based on theoretical considerations, the German Federal Statistical Office has developed a framework for an Environmental Economic Accounting System. The objective is to add meaningful modules to the traditional System of National Accounts which are designed to quantify the external (environmental) effects of economic activities. The framework could already be realised and published to an extent that is relevant for actual policy making in Germany.

AB This paper formulates an investment value transversality condition in a continuous-time growth model, which characterizes competitive paths along which current net national product measures the welfare achieved along the path. This transversality condition requires that the present value of net investment goes to zero asymptotically. An example provided shows that, in general, competitive paths do not necessarily satisfy this condition. It is also shown that, in a standard growth model including an exhaustible resource as an essential factor of production, competitive paths always satisfy this condition. Implications regarding national income accounting procedures and sustainable development policies are discussed. JEL Classification Numbers: D90; O11; O41; Q32.

SO JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF RELIGION
LA English
DT Article
ID MULTIPLE DISCREPANCIES THEORY; ELABORATION; MOVEMENT
AB Contextualizing the back-to-the-land experience with mindfulness, a variant of meditative phenomena within deep ecology's contention that humankind requires a fundamental shift in consciousness in order to insure ecological sustainability, this study compares and contrasts those variables that explain variance in mindfulness, operationalized as a quasi-religious indicator, with those that explain variance in church attendance, a measure of formal religions behavior. Drawing on a national sample for a mailed questionnaire survey of back-to-the-landers, the study found that the predictor variables for mindfulness share little overlap with those that explain variance for church attendance. The exception is spiritual mindedness, itself a quasi-religious measure, which has a statistically significant relationship with both mindfulness and church attendance. The data suggest, then, that the religious and the quasi-religious are relatively independent spheres of human behavior and sentiment. It would appear, consequently, at least in terms of the back-to-the-land sample and the assumptions of deep ecology, that the adherents of organized religion are not as likely to be disposed towards ecologically sustainable frames of mind as those who center their spirituality on quasi-religious practices such as mindfulness.

AB Africa is the world's most aided major region. Yet economic growth has been disappointingly low there. A number of factors explain the poor outcomes and limited sustainability of and in Africa. But the organisation and management of the aid relationship is a particularly important one, including the dependence of Africans on that aid. The currently popular nostrums for solving the problem of the effectiveness in Africa - selectivity, ownership, sector investment programme and more aid - are as yet inadequate and often contradictory Much more work and honest debate needs to occur before the problem of aid effectiveness can be tackled in Africa.

ID ABUSE TREATMENT; RISK BEHAVIORS; AIDS; PREVENTION
AB This study examined gender differences in sexual practices and beliefs about condom use among rural injecting drug users (IDUs) admitted to treatment programs. Data from 79 usable surveys completed by inpatient and outpatient drug treatment clients showed that females reported fewer perceived benefits (p < .027) and greater frequency of receptive anal sex compared to their male counterparts (p < .028). Although knowledge was not significantly related to reported sexual practices, Human Immunodeficiency Vines (HIV)/Acquired immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) knowledge was extremely limited for both males and females in this sample of IDUs (M = 3.69, SD = 1.71), suggesting that basic HIV/AIDS education must be an early and significant part of the treatment process. We argue that HIV/AIDS education must then continue throughout the entire treatment process for sustainable behavior and belief change to occur among IDUs.

AB 1. Agrostis capillaris-Festuca ovina-dominated communities are widespread in the uplands of Great Britain. They are agriculturally productive but little is known about how to manage this community for specific goals. Vegetation trajectories were examined in this plant community under different sheep grazing management regimes at two sites in Scotland. One site had a substantial presence of moorland species, the other was characterized by a more productive vegetation. Management consisted of maintaining sward heights of 3, 4.5 or 6 cm during the growing season, or complete exclusion of grazing stock.
   2. Changes in species composition were small over the 7 years of the experiment. Few species invaded or were lost during the course of the study. The observed changes were largely as a result of shifts in abundance of the dominant species.
   3. Maintenance of sward height at low levels (3 or 4.5 cm) during the growing season resulted in the spread of Nardus stricta where present. Where N. stricta was absent, the sward developed a higher content of mosses, specifically Hypnum jutlandicum and Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus.
   4. Removal of grazing resulted in an increase of cover of grazing-intolerant species, such as Deschampsia flexuosa and Molinia caerulea, and in the cover of dwarf shrub species where present.
   5. The two sites differed in the treatment that resulted in the smallest change in species composition. At the more productive site, maintenance of the sward at 4.5 cm resulted in the smallest overall change in species composition. At the less productive site, grazing the sward to 6 cm resulted in the smallest shift in vegetation composition. Grazing at this height appeared to prevent the spread of both M. caerulea and N. stricta.
   6. The study demonstrates that sustainable grazing regimes for upland Agrostis-Festuca grasslands need to take into account both the initial composition of the vegetation, specifically the presence of species capable of replacing A. capillaris and F. ovina and of achieving dominance, and the overall productivity of the site.

AB Circadian systems direct many metabolic parameters and, at the same time, they appear to be exquisitely shielded from metabolic variations. Although the recent decade of circadian research has brought insights into how circadian periodicity may be generated at the molecular level, little is known about the relationship between this molecular feedback loop and metabolism both at the cellular and at the organismic level. In this theoretical paper, we conjecture about the interdependence between circadian rhythmicity and metabolism. A mathematical model based on the chemical reactions of photosynthesis demonstrates that metabolism as such may generate rhythmicity in the circadian range. Two additional models look at the possible function of feedback loops outside of the circadian oscillator. These feedback loops contribute to the robustness and sustainability of circadian oscillations and to compensation for long- and short-term metabolic variations, The specific circadian property of temperature compensation is put into the context of metabolism. As such, it represents a general compensatory mechanism that shields the clock from metabolic variations.

AB A model is used for the dynamic and spatially explicit exploration of near future agricultural land-use changes. In a case study for Ecuador, different plausible scenarios are formulated, taking into account possible developments in national food demand until the year 2010. The protection of nature parks and restrictions due to land degradation are evaluated with respect to their possible spatial impacts on the land-use change dynamics within the country. Under the assumptions of the demand scenarios, agricultural land-use expands significantly, resulting in more use of land in existing agricultural areas and frontier-type expansion into relatively undisturbed natural areas. The patterns of change depend on the increase in demand, competition between land-use types, changes in driving factors of land use, and the area and characteristics of land that is excluded from agricultural use. The modelled land-use dynamics are related to their possible impacts on the natural resource base, specifically soil fertility. The results indicate potential negative effects of land-use changes on the soil nutrient balance and biodiversity. It is argued that spatial and temporal quantification of land-use dynamics at the landscape level can support research and policies aimed at understanding the driving factors of land-use change and the behaviour of complex agro-ecosystems under changing conditions at different scales. In this way, issues dealing with sustainable food production and the management of the natural resource base can be addressed in a more integrated and quantitative manner. (C) 1999 Academic Press.

TI Annual forest inventory - Cornerstone of sustainability in the South
SO JOURNAL OF FORESTRY
LA English
DT Article
AB With many competing uses and large regional shifts in forestland use, the sustainability of southern forests is being questioned. The new Southern Annual Forest Inventory System (SAFIS) is being implemented to address regional, state, and national questions regarding past, current, and projected changes in the southern forest. The annual inventory system will provide the information needed to closely monitor and quantify the landscape dynamics of southern forests. These annual inventory data will form the basis of state, regional, and national forest sustainability assessments.

ID FIRM PERFORMANCE; TOBIN-Q; DIVERSIFICATION
AB This study decomposes the performance of US public firms between 1981 and 1994 into year, industry, corporate-focus and firm effects. Performance is measured by Tobin's q, accounting profitability, and a hybrid measure. The results show that firm effects were more important to performance than industry effects, although industry effects had a large permanent component. Corporate focus was not important. The stylized facts suggest that competitive advantages - that is, differences between direct competitors in the same industry - were at least as important as industry influences on performance. Industry influences were more predictable and sustainable than competitive advantages, however.

AB The aims of this paper are threefold. The first aim is to provide a critique of the reform proposal of the Harvard School of Public Health for Hone Kong's health care system through privatization of the public sector services. The second aim is to argue for the duty of society to guarantee every member equal access to a basic level of health care based on the values of equity, care and free choice. The third aim is to explore some suggestions about delivery structures and financial arrangements of a dual sector health care system which will better enable society to provide a basic level of health carl that is sustainable and affordable, while brine at the same time consistent with the values of care, equity and free choice.

TI Ugandan relations with Western donors in the 1990s: what impact on
   democratisation?
SO JOURNAL OF MODERN AFRICAN STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
AB Aid donors' support for democratisation in sub-Saharan Africa in the 1990s has been tempered by their desire to achieve other objectives. In Uganda, a high level of donor support for the Museveni government has been compatible with the Ugandan government's reluctance to introduce multiparty democracy. Donors have opted for 'dialogue' rather than coercive methods. This may be ascribed to a number of factors, including the destruction from which Uganda was recovering, the need to present Uganda as a success story for economic liberalisation, and donors' need to maintain good relations with Uganda in order to pursue their foreign policy goals. The resulting donor-recipient relationship has however created dangers for the maintenance of long-term sustainable democracy in Uganda, by condoning divisive policies, and neglecting the need for coalition-building and conflict resolution.

AB Several potential cover crops were evaluated for their susceptibility to Meloidogyne arenaria race 1, M. incognita race 1, and M. javanica in a series of five greenhouse experiments. No galls or egg masses were observed on roots of castor (Ricinus communis), cowpea (Vigna unguiculata cv. Iron Clay), crotalaria ( Crotalaria spectabilis), or American jointvetch (Aeschynomene americana). Occasional egg masses (rating less than or equal to 1.0 on 0-5 scale) were observed on marigold (Tagetes minuta) in one test with M. incognita, on sesame (Sesamum indicum cv. Paloma) in a test with M. arenaria, and on sunn hemp (Crotalaria juncea cv. Tropic Sun) in 1 of 2 tests with M. incognita; otherwise, these crops were free of egg masses. Numbers of second-stage juveniles (J2) hatched from eggs per root system were low (less than or equal to 10/pot) for the above mentioned crops. Egg-mass levels and numbers of hatched J2 of M. incognita on pearl millet (Pennisetum typhoides, Tifleaf II hybrid) were comparable to those on a susceptible tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum cv. Rutgers). In a test with M. arenaria, egg mass levels and numbers of J2 on Japanese miller (Echinochloa frumentacea) were similar to those on tomato. Japanese miller was susceptible to each of the nematode isolates tested. However, several of the crops evaluated were very poor hosts or non-hosts of the nematode isolates, including several legumes (cowpea, crotalaria,jointvetch, sunn hemp) that have potential use in both nematode and nitrogen management.

AB This paper reviews che empirical evidence on the relationships between urban patterns and various dimensions of environmental quality and performance. I first examine approaches to measuring urban environmental performance, drawing on dhe concepts of carrying capacity, ecological footprint, environmental space, and appropriated ecosystem area. Since cities affect and are affected by ecological systems far beyond their physical boundaries, I propose including interactions at the local, regional, and global scales in the definition of environmental performance. I then systematically review the current literature on the relationship between four structural variables typically used to describe urban patterns-form, density, grain, and connectivity-and four dimensions of environmental performance-sources, sinks, ecological support systems, and human well-being. I conclude that what we measure and the scale of analysis affect the direction of observable urban impacts. We must consider these factors as we select measures of urban environmental performance.
