AB This paper presents a reflection on the introduction of methods and tools of "participative foresight" for scientific and technology policy as well as environmental policy fields. Future studies have recently made a comeback under the label of foresight. Future technology studies no longer claim to forecast the future, but are presented as a strategic tool for improving interaction between key actors and for anticipatory policy making. They can be defined as a "process by which one comes to a fuller understanding of the forces shaping the long term future which should be taken into account in policy formulation, planning and decision-making" [Foresight in Federal Government Policymaking, Futures Res. Quart. (1985) 29]. We discuss applications of this approach for perspectives on environmental policy and sustainable development. Foresight opens up the possibility of negotiating a new and more fruitful relationship or 'social contract' between science and technology, on the one hand, and society on the other. The focus has moved from merely scientific and industrial insights to social demand, thus emphasizing the importance of both the production and "supply" of innovation, and the "demand" as signaled in the views of citizens.

AB Nitrogen nutrition Most frequently limits the crop productivity. Chemical nitrogen fertilizers being ecologically and economically expensive, interest in exploitation of alternative or supplementary nitrogen sources has been renewed to encourage sustainable agriculture. Reducing the fertilizer nitrogen use while maintaining the native soil nitrogen resources and enhancing crop nitrogen output by biological nitrogen-fixation systems is desirable from both environmental and economic perspectives. Such a production system would enhance agricultural production in the long term in a way that is economically viable and ecologically sound, as well cis socially acceptable. Towards the sustainable rice production, rice cultivar with better nitrogen use efficiency is one of the options. In the case of nitrogen inputs into rice production systems, it may be the judicious use of nitrogen fertilizers and/or nitrogen derived from atmospheric nitrogen via biological nitrogen fixation. Developing rice with biological nitrogen fixation capacity, i.e. autotrophy for nitrogen, could help farmers overcome the nitrogen nutrition limitations and increase the productivity, reducing dependency on chemical nitrogen fertilizers. The various options and the pros and cons of such options are discussed herein, as a part of an approach to the prospect of achieving nitrogen autotrophic rice.

AB The response of three water delivery schedules, representing various levels of flexibility, on crop production, water saving, soil salinization, drainage volumes and watertable behavior was examined. A physical-based transient soil water and solute transfer model, Soil-Water-Atmosphere-Plant (SWAP), was used as a tool. The evaluations were made for un-restricted and restricted water supply situations considering three different watertable conditions prevailing in the fourth drainage project (FDP) of the Punjab, Pakistan. From the simulation results it is apparent that on average the effect of irrigation schedule flexibility on crop yields is not very significant. However, compared to a fixed schedule provided un-restricted canal water supplies are available, the Productivity of irrigation water supply (Y-act/I-IT), is up to 30% higher for the on-demand schedule. The on-demand schedule capable of complying with the temporal variations in climate is also more effective in water saving, reducing drainage volumes and controlling rising water-tables if fanners follow guidelines and do not over-irrigate. In the present water deficient environment of the Indus basin, the benefits of the on-demand schedule and a fixed schedule are comparable. In the absence of sufficient canal water supplies, infrastructure and a well-designed and effective monitoring and communication system, moving towards the on-demand system will be un-productive. For the longterm sustainability of the irrigation system, improvements in the performance of the present water allocations and on-farm water management practices seems to be more necessary.

AB Integrated mariculture is a feasible method to maintain sustainable and high productivity of aquaculture. The choice of cultured animals and biofilters in the integrated system has to be made on the basis of their nutrient release rates and the clearance rate of each component of the system. We are examining the nutrient release rates among fish (mangrove snapper, Lutjanus russeli, and sea perch, Abudefduf septemfasciatus), abalone ( Haliotis diversicolor), scallops (Chlamys noblis), and green mussels (Perna viridis) in the laboratory. Fish feed is the major sources of inorganic nutrient input in fish farms. The orthophosphate and ammonia release rates of minced trash fish (1593 mug P g(-1) day(-1) and 150 mug N g(-1) day(-1)) were respectively 6-12 times and 4-88 times higher than those of cultivated fish. Mangrove snapper had the overall highest nutrient release rate, followed by sea perch, abalone, scallops, and mussels for nitrite and nitrate; and followed by abalone, sea perch, mussels, and scallops for orthophosphate and ammonium. Among mollusks, abalone had the highest orthophosphate (162 mug P g(-1) day(-1)), nitrate (1.4 mug N g(-1) day(-1)), nitrite (1.6 mug N g(-1) day(-1)) and ammonium (25.0 mug N g(-1) day(-1)) release rates per gram wet weight per day. Abalone released large amounts of orthophosphate, nitrite and nitrate in the experiment. Scallops and green mussels had low nutrient release rates. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

DE karst; ecosystem; Vietnam
AB Karst in Vietnam covers an area of about 60,000 km(2), i.e. 18 % of the surface of the country. The country has an annual average temperature of 24 degreesC, an annual average rainfall of 2300 nun and a relative humidity of about 90%. Karst in Vietnam is typified by peak cluster-depression landscapes ranging in elevation from 200 to over 2000 m. Tower and coastal karst landscapes also exit. Because of naturally favourable conditions, karst ecosystems are diverse and very rich. Higher plants(cormophytes) are abundant. They are represented by approximately 2000 species, 908 genera, 224 families, 86 orders and 7 phyla. They form a thick vegetation cover of evergreen tropical rainforest. Knowledge about lower plants is limited. The fauna is rich and diverse. Phyla such as Protozoa, Vermes, Mollusca and Arthropoda are yet ill known. Preliminary results show that the phylum Chordata is represented by 541 species from 80 families, 40 orders and 5 classes. There exist many precious and rare mammals, in particular some endemic species such as Trachypithecus poliocephalus, T. delacouri, Rhinopithecus avanculus, Rhinolophus rouxi, Seotoma dineties and Silurus cuephuongensis. The class Insecta has about 2000 species.
   The fast population growth, particularly in the mountainous areas of the country, triggers an increasing demand for land and therefore threatens the ecosystem. To obtain land for farming, people have cut, burned and destroyed natural forest cover; resulting in occurrence of hazards such as soil-loss, water-loss, flash floods, mud-rock flows, rock-falls, severe drought, water logging and changes of karstic aquifers etc. Poaching precious animals and illegal logging are increasing. In contrast to other natural systems, karst ecosystems cannot be reestablished once damaged. Living karst landscapes will become rocky desert ones without life. Conservation of karstic environmental systems in general and karstic ecosystems in particular should not be the sole vocation of scientists but also a duty and responsibility of authorities and people from all levels. A good example of a multidisciplinary approach to karst-related problems is the implementation of the Vietnamese-Belgian Karst Project (VBEKAP): "Rural development in the mountain karst area of NW Vietnam by sustainable water and land management and social learning: its conditions and facilitation". The aim of this project is to improve living conditions of local people and sustained protection and management of the karst environment and ecosystem.

AB Sustainable resource management requires understanding the factors that increase or decrease species richness. Regional species richness patterns may be predicted by analysing patterns of variation in the environment. A number of studies have shown that bird species richness at a regional scale is influenced by climatic variables. We examined environmental correlates of bird species richness at a quarter degree square scale (55 x 55 km). Mean annual potential evapotranspiration accounts for 46% of the observed variation in species richness, while mean annual temperature and range annual potential evapotranspiration are significantly correlated with species richness and together account for a further 5% of the observed variation. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that environmentally available energy limits regional species richness.

AB Contrary to a widespread belief, total factor productivity (TFP) growth, as measured by the conventional growth accounting approach, contributed little to economic growth during the Green Revolution in the Indian Punjab. This paper shows that this 'productivity paradox' arises because of a fundamental problem with conventional measures of TFP growth. When technical change is not Flicks-neutral, it is impossible to separate the contribution of technical change from that of factor accumulation. Simple exercises to assess the magnitudes involved in the Punjab case show that the bias in conventional TFP estimates is severe: 'corrected' measures of productivity growth are between 100 and 200% higher per year during the Green Revolution.

AB This article discusses a long-term participatory process used to develop agroforestry systems in the Zona da Mata, Minas Gerais, Brazil. This area has various characteristics considered appropriate for establishing such systems, which, if well managed, contribute to sustainable land use. In 1993, university researchers, NGO staff and small-scale farmers started to develop agroforestry systems using a participatory process, involving various steps and fine-tuning. In 1994/1995, 39 small experiments were started involving 33 farmers in 11 municipalities. The participatory approach was effective, as almost all the farmers involved continue with their experiments, while others have joined. However, although results in terms of soil conservation are promising, expectations regarding increase in production and reduction of input have not yet been met, causing tensions and forcing adjustments. The benefits and problems encountered during the first 5 years are discussed, in order to highlight the complexity of participatory development of agroforestry systems and the need for their continual development.

AB (T)he implementation of land use studies in most developing nations is often faced with the lack of data. Participatory studies offer the possibility of complementing data sets by tapping into indigenous knowledge. They also encourage the adoption of sustainable land management practices by establishing partnership and dialogue among stakeholders. This paper reports on a study in Aarsal, a semi-arid mountainous locality (36,000 ha) in Lebanon where conflicts in land use have recently emerged between pastoralists and growers. The study aimed at supporting sustainable land management in Aarsal by carrying out a land capability classification and a land use analysis. Indigenous knowledge was used as one of the information sources for the land capability classification. Participatory rural appraisal was used to describe the indigenous agroecological zoning and local soil classification. Geographic information system (GIS) technology was used to produce a land capability map and to analyze the current land use. Most of the land area was found to be too marginal for conventional farming, and nearly 5000 ha are in serious danger of land degradation. Moreover, the shrinkage of the grazing lands caused by the expansion of orchards partly explains the reduction in the size of small ruminant flocks. The combination of participatory approach, land capability evaluation and GIS provided a satisfactory understanding of the physical and biological land management constraints in Aarsal, fostered dialogue between the different stakeholders, and created opportunities for the identification of sustainable land management options.

AB The sustainable indigenous agro-ecosystems of India, a majority of which are degraded or destroyed, need protection. The main objective of this study was to analyse the traditional agro-ecosystems from structural and functional point of view and their interactions with other biophysical and socio-economic characters with a view to offer possible solutions. Analysis of traditional agro-ecosystems of three tribal villa es, inhabited by Kondhs of Eastern Ghats of Orissa, India, revealed that cultivated land occupied 66% of the total land area. This covered valley, shifting and home garden cultivation. Under valley, lice (Oryza sativa L.) showed the maximum productivity (2-4 Mg ha(-1)) among the crops. Minor millets and redgram. (Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp.) were cultivated under shifting cultivation in one of the villages. Vegetables and spices were the main crop under home garden. In valley agriculture human and draught power were the major inputs of energy, while in shifting cultivation human labour was the only source. Out of the total agricultural yield, 52.5, 90.6 and 75.9% were consumed in the villages of Rajikakhola, Nediguda and Badruguda, respectively. When agriculture, forest and animal husbandry sectors were taken together the average share of agricultural sector to the total consumption in the villages was 68.4%, the rest being contributed by forest, while the contribution of animal husbandry was almost negligible. Agricultural production can be stabilized through available rain water management, application of organic manure to agricultural fields and protection of the existing forests. Abandoned Podu (i.e. shifting cultivation) fields can be improved through agro-forestry practices. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Data of a 32-year field experiment (1967-1998), conducted on a fertile sandy loess in the Hercynian dry region of central Germany, were used to (i) demonstrate the methodological basis of energy balancing in a long-term trial and (ii) identify time trends of various energetic parameters, as affected by the rate and form of nitrogen (N) application. Of the 16 fertilizer regimes, 5 were selected to represent the broad range of N supply conditions: no N, mineral N only, farmyard manure N only, high input of both mineral and farmyard manure N, and moderate input of the two forms of N. The crop rotation included various cereals, sugar beets, and potatoes. In calculating the energy balances, changes in soil and crop husbandry practices over the past decades were taken into account. The input of energy associated with mineral N fertilization declined markedly with duration of the experiment, whereas the input of energy associated with chemical plant protection increased. The input of energy was highly variable; it ranged from 8.9 to 36.9 GJ ha(-1) per year in the last crop rotation, depending on the N regime and the crop. Because of the high soil fertility, the average biomass yield of all the crops grown within a rotation was as high per year. On the fertilized plots, net as 13.5 t dry matter (DM) ha(-1) per year; the output of energy was as high as 215 GJ ha(-1) energy output (energy content of the grains minus energy input) and energy utilization improved with time. Winter wheat, fertilized with moderate amounts of mineral and farmyard manure N, showed an increase in net energy output of 86% from 1972 to 1995. During the same period, the energy intensity (input of fossil energy per grain equivalent) declined by 45%, and the output/input ratio increased by 67%. In part, these trends can be attributed to the higher grain yield (+59%). Energy output and net energy output are the crucial parameters when the demand for plant products cannot be met because of the limited area for growing crops. Energy intensity and energy output/input ratio are integrative indicators of the environmental effects of crop production, which can be used to formulate recommendations for fertilization, which are optimum as far as the environment is concerned.

AB New N management and conservation tillage systems are needed to improve agricultural sustainability on the Blackland Prairie of Texas. In 1994, an experiment was established to determine plant response to N fertilizer rate and timing within three different tillage systems. A split plot experiment with four replications was established on a Houston Black clay (fine, smectitic, thermic Udic Haplusterts) soil. The main plots were chisel tillage system without beds (conventional for the area), chisel tillage system with raised wide beds, and no-tillage system with raised wide beds. The subplots were seven fertility treatments: four fertility rates (0, 56, 112, and 168 kg N ha(-1) applied at planting) and three timing treatments (N applied in the fall, at planting, and split between at planting and 30 d later). The crop rotation was wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), corn (Zea mays L.), and sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench]. The experimental treatments were imposed on corn each year for 4 yr. Plant samples were collected for grain yield, biomass production, and N uptake. Grain yield ranged from 150 to 8435 kg ha (1). In wet years, grain yields and N uptake increased with N fertilizer up to 168 kg N ha(-1), and fall application reduced yields 30% when compared with fertilizer application at planting. The highest yields were observed with the no-tillage. Results from this study indicate that application of fertilizer in the fall may result in lost yield potential and that conservation tillage systems may be the most reliable in the Texas Blackland Prairie.

AB The evolution of thinking about energy is discussed. When the authors began collaborating 20 years ago, energy was typically considered from a growth-oriented, supply-side perspective, with a focus on consumption trends and how to expand supplies to meet rising demand. They were deeply troubled by the environmental, security and equity implications of that approach. For instance, about two billion people lack access to affordable modern energy seriously limiting their opportunities for a better life. And energy is a significant contributor to environmental problems, including indoor air pollution, urban air pollution, acidification, and global warming. The authors saw the need to evolve a different perspective in which energy is provided in ways that help solve such serious problems. They argued that energy must become an instrument for advancing sustainable development-economically viable, need-oriented, self-reliant and environmentally sound development-and that the focus should be on the end uses of energy and the services that energy provides. Energy technological options that can help meet sustainable development goals are discussed. The necessity of developing and employing innovative technological solutions is stressed. The possibilities of technological leapfrogging that could enable developing countries to avoid repeating the mistakes of the industrialized countries is illustrated with a discussion of ethanol in Brazil. The role foreign direct investment might play in bringing advanced technologies to developing countries is highlighted. Near-and long-term strategies for rural energy are discussed. Finally, policy issues are considered for evolving the energy system so that it will be consistent with and supportive of sustainable development.

AB Diffuse pollution from agricultural land is one of the main causes for lake eutrophication. Multipond systems, an ancient invention in China, are composed of many tiny ponds and ditches, scattered in agricultural fields. After a long period of research in an experimental watershed in Liuchahe, it was found that multipond systems constitute diffuse pollution control. They have a large capacity for water storage and serve to control the export of water, suspended matter, and phosphorus. Multipond systems significantly reduce runoff velocity. Sediments and phosphorus retained in the Liuchahe watershed were 14.38 . 10(6) and 7016 kg yr(-1), respectively (area 691.6 ha). Irrigation provides an effective way to recycle and remove phosphorus. The use of multipond systems is a sustainable way to recycle valuable nutrients and reduce their discharge and thus pollution of downstream lakes.

AB This study documents how teachers who participated in a professional development program on understanding the development of students' mathematical thinking continued to implement the principles of the program 4 years after it ended. Twenty-two teachers participated in follow-up interviews and classroom observations. All 22 teachers maintained some use of children's thinking and 10 teachers continued learning in noticeable ways. The 10 teachers engaged in generative growth (a) viewed children's thinking as central. (b) possessed detailed knowledge about children's thinking. (c) discussed frameworks for characterizing the development of chldren's mathematical thinking. (d) perceived themselves as creating and elaborating their own knowledge about children's thinking, and (e) sought colleagues who also possessed knowledge about children's thinking for support. The follow-up revealed insights about generative growth, sustainability of changed practice and professional development.

AB Soil redistribution by tillage is becoming a recognized soil erosion process. Landscapes subject to tillage erosion are topographically complex or have a high number-of field boundaries. Tillage erosion contributes to the evolution of landscape heterogeneity through creation of distinct landforms and the relatively rapid redistribution of soils from upland positions to depressions. The resultant variability in soil properties has an important effect on crop production. Our objective is to provide a basic understanding of tillage erosion by describing the tillage erosion process and to discuss the effect of tillage erosion on soil properties, and soil productivity, and interaction with water erosion. A brief discussion is included on the subject of future research needs. A soil transport coefficient (k). has been determined as k = -Drhobbeta; where D is tillage depth (m), rhob is the soil bulk density (kg m(-3)), and beta is the slope of the linear regression equation of the relationship between soil displacement and slope gradient. This k-value effectively describes soil transport as a function of slope gradient for a variety of tillage operations; however, the gain or loss in soil mass at any point on the landscape is proportional to hillslope curvature. That is, soil loss from tillage operation will take place on convexities and upper field boundaries, while soil deposition occurs on concavities and lower field boundaries. Soil loss from tillage operations can commonly be greater than what is considered sustainable. As soil is,removed from upslope field boundaries or convex slope positions, subsurface soil horizons become exposed. The exposure and subsequent dispersion of this subsoil material, in addition to soil accumulation at lower slope positions, alters soil properties and introduces greater variation in soil properties over the landscape. The recognition of soil translocation by tillage and its subsequent effect on soil properties and variability presents considerable challenges. Soil conservation strategies must be broadened to include tillage erosion to be fully effective.

AB Wind erosion constitutes a major threat for the sustainable use of land resources in the Sahel. It is favored by a long dry season, low vegetation cover, sandy soils and the occurrence of strongly erosive winds at critical times of the year, Wind erosion can result in considerable losses of soil and nutrients at the plot and field scale and impart significant damage to crops through sand blasting and seedling burial. Current land management such as land clearing practices also largely favors the occurrence of wind erosion, forcing farmers to actively implement conservation measures that reduce the potential impact of wind erosion. As a rule, such measures need to be low cost, rely on local skills and knowledge, and typically present multiple benefits besides wind erosion control such as soil fertility improvement or the production of products for household consumption. The present paper reviews the current knowledge about the extent and severity of wind erosion in the Sahel at scales up to village land units, and discusses some of the technological options that are available to farmers for reducing the impact of wind erosion on agricultural land. Emphasis is laid both on the technical and socio-economic feasibility of the techniques.

TI Role of weathering of fine-grained micas in potassium management of
   Indian soils

AB Although the major soils of India (alluvial, ferruginous and black soils), endowed with fine-grained micas, are known as natural K suppliers to plants, crop response to K fertilizer treatment has been anomalous. The silt and clay fractions of 14 benchmark soils were subjected to repeated batch type Ba-K exchange to study the rate of K release. The significant positive correlation between cumulative K release in 25 extractions and X-ray intensity ratio of peak heights of the 001 and 002 basal reflections of mica in the silt (r = 0.629 at 1% level) and clay (r = 0.729 at 1% level) suggested that although the fine-grained muscovite and biotite co-exist in soils, the rate of K release and crop response to K are related primarily to the presence of biotite only while muscovite remains as an inert source of K in soils justifying the crop response to K fertilizers.
   Soil micas under a scanning electron microscope (SEM) indicated that biotite particles were generally thick, showing layer separation with bending at edges due to the formation of vermiculite around their rims. The muscovites, on the other hand, were characterized by very minor layer separation at their edges. To resolve the issue of layer separation of micas through the release of K during the formation of soils, experimental studies of repeated Ba-K exchange were conducted with specimen muscovite and biotite and also on the mixture of the two micas. Experimental studies indicated that at ambient temperature and pressure, muscovite released negligible amount of K from its exposed surfaces and the weathering of muscovite was inhibited in the presence of biotite. This confirmed the observation that when muscovite and biotite co-exist, muscovite hardly weathers in soil environments. Hence, its enrichment in soils does not enhance the supply of K. Therefore, weathering products like di- and trioctahedral vermiculite and smectite are generally the products of the weathering of biotite mica.
   The X-ray intensity ratio of 001 and 002 basal reflections of mica has been found to be an effective diagnostic parameter to find out the quality of mica and therefore to judge the K releasing potential of soils. However, actual quantification of fine-grained biotites of soils appears to be mandatory for the precise determination of K reserves in soils in order to predict release of K for sustainable K management.

AB Increasing process performances and reducing its emissions are two of the major goals of process sustainability. Energy analysis and synthesis techniques allow to stress major elements defining the process integration, not only in terms of energy savings but mainly in terms of rational transformation of energy. This article addresses several results of our experience in the implementation of process energy integration techniques and their contribution to the process sustainability. The method used combines energy integration principles with advanced mixed integer linear programming models and graphical representations to tackle a real life site scale problem. The application, an ammonia production plant, revisits the major rules of the energy integration with the perspective of the overall energy efficiency including combined production of heat and mechanical power for an existing process. With the solutions obtained, our work shows the difficulty of defining process sustainability when cogeneration and process integration with new technologies are considered simultaneously.

AB Laboratory scale batch experiments were performed under controlled conditions at different total ammonia concentrations (10-300 mg N l(-1)) and controlled pH values of 6.8-8.7 using settled domestic wastewater to measure the effect of the ionised (NH4+ or ammonium) and un-ionised form (NH3) on the growth of the duckweed Lemna gibba. Relative growth rates (RGR) varied between 0 and 0.3 per day. The toxicity of total ammonia to duckweed was a result of the effect of both, ionised and un-ionised, forms at low NH3 concentrations (< 1 mg N l(-1)). At higher NH3 concentrations, the toxic effect of the ionised form could be disregarded. Relative growth rates of L. gibba decreased linearly with increasing NH3 concentrations up to a maximum level (8 mg N l(-1)), above which duckweed died. These data indicate that L. gibba can be used to treat wastewater containing high total ammonia concentrations as long as certain pH levels are not exceeded. Extrapolated relative growth rates resulting from different combinations of pH and total ammonia are given for the examined ranges. Up to a pH of 7.8, a substantial production of 55 kg DW ha(-1) per day was achieved. Wastewater treatment using L. gibba becomes impossible at pH levels above approximately 9.8, depending on the temperature. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Sustained skeletal muscle power for cardiac assist devices: Implications

SO ASAIO JOURNAL

DT Article

AB A device to harness power from skeletal muscle contracting in a linear configuration is under development. This application requires a sustained level of power that is dependent upon muscle mechanics and metabolic properties. A biomechanical muscle model and a metabolic model constructed from experimental data were used to predict maximum power available in a sustainable region of loading and stimulation conditions. Latissimus dorsi (LD) of four goats were evaluated in vivo after a 10 week in situ conditioning protocol with an implanted Telectronics myostimulator. The LD insertion was reconnected to a hydraulic loading system, allowing isometric and isotonic contractions for biomechanical characterization. Metabolic utilization was measured by a thermister based myothermic technique. Brief fatigue tests of working isotonic contractions revealed stimulation conditions associated with sustained power. The results show metabolic utilization was dependent on contraction duration, rate, force, and stroke. The region of sustainable contractions was found for a range of durations of 0.1 to 0.6 sec and rates of 10 to 120 bpm. The boundary for the sustainable power region was well approximated by a constant value of metabolic utilization. A constant duty cycle (contraction to cycle duration ratio) also approximated the sustained power but differed by as much as 30% during the shorter contraction durations. The results demonstrate that a mechanical muscle model can predict maximum sustained power when the operating conditions are constrained to a sustainable range determined by a metabolic model. Furthermore, metabolic constraints influence the optimum conditions for sustained power needed in the design of skeletal muscle powered assist devices.

AB For the immediately threatened forests and bromeliads in the highlands of Chiapas, Mexico, we suggest an empirical approach to attain sustainability in the gathering of bromeliads for home decoration. On the basis of theoretical considerations and the results from a pilot study in three forest stands along a disturbance gradient at La Florecilla, we propose that harvesting should be limited to populations (1) that have a density no less than 9000 large rosettes/ha, (2) that are evenly distributed in space, and (3) that grow in the lower stratum of the forest, thus having little effect on their reproductive capacity. In a second study at La Florecilla we used a plotless point-centred quarter method to estimate the population density and homogeneity in spatial distribution of all species of bromeliads in the structurally heterogeneous forest. We found one species, Tillandsia vicentina, that met the prerequisites, having both a satisfactory average population density of ca. 24,000 large ( > 20 cm) rosettes/ha on oaks and a spatially even distribution. We estimate that an annual harvest of 112,000 rosettes of T. vicentina from the lower stratum of the 160 ha forest at La Florecilla can be maintained, in a 4-year rotation cycle. The implementation of a monitoring program should be included in any management plan. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Some key technical lessons from the Green Building Challenge (GBC) process over the past four years are examined and the future direction of these developments is considered. The GBC assessment method consists of the definition, structuring and scoring of a range of collectively agreed performance criteria-the GBC assessment framework, and the development of a software version to operationalize the framework-GBTool. This generic assessment method is designed to be customized and applied to different building types and cultural contexts. However, its development and testing has exposed numerous important conceptual and technical issues related to building environmental performance assessment. Additional features introduced in GBC 2000-normalizing for occupancy, making context an explicit part of the assessment process, and a set of absolute environmental performance indicators-show considerable promise. The transformation of the GBC assessment framework into a sustainability assessment tool represents the most important issue in its future development.

AB The scope of Africa's developmental problems and a dramatically different worldview from that of the West requires a different approach to sustainability in Africa. The context of poverty and rapid urbanization suggests that sustainable urban development should be the focus of sustainable construction in Africa. However, it is argued this should be undertaken in a way that is relevant to the African cultural context, possibly through the inclusion of the values and worldview of traditional Africa in the definition and principles of sustainability. Using the understanding of interconnectedness as expressed by the cultural concept of Ubuntu, some principles are suggested for an African concept of sustainability that can inform the Western sustainability model and make it relevant to Africa.

AB Planning professions have focused their attention on continued technological solutions to environmental problems despite discussions relating to the sustainability of the built human community. However, ecological sustainability involves the identification of ecologically sound alternatives to current practices, not necessarily involving technological intervention. In the urban ecosystem this means the identification of the processes of urban change. New theory, tools, and research methods in ecological systems have the potential to improve the dynamics of change in urban environments. A variety of sophisticated computational and theoretical tools exist for characterizing urban systems at a conceptual level, and for visualizing and understanding these characterizations. The theoretical underpinnings and practical application of the integrated, multi-disciplinary, ecological and engineering approach to modelling urbanland use transformation is presented. A new tool, LEAM (Land use Evolution and Impact Assessment Model), has been developed to provide researchers and professionals to address urban dynamics in greater detail at a variety of scales and interfaces. The conceptual framework of the LEAM model is provided, followed by an application of the model to a 'collar county' in the metro Chicago area. The model can visually examine the dynamic spread of human development in the county and the associated environmental impacts of the urban growth and development patterns.

AB The process of creating and implementing Green Building Design and Construction Guidelines for the City of Santa Monica, USA and its interplay with city administrative processes is described and the strategic lessons are assessed. Like most North American cities, Santa Monica's civic administration had dealt with environmental issues on an ad-hoc basis, with individual departments designated to respond to particular issues as they arose. After extensive public consultation, and initial work by the guidelines team, the project was expanded beyond simple design advice, to modify existing city programmes and ordinances; and to create new ordinances aimed directly at critical aspects of environmental sustainability. Perhaps more important, the co-operation and co-ordination that marked the guidelines project from the beginning has continued since, possibly heralding a new way that city operations will address sustainability issues that inherently cross administrative boundaries.

AB A cooperative research center based in Townsville, Australia, has completed almost 6 yrs of applied and strategic research, education, and extension in support of conservation and ecologically sustainable use of the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area. One cornerstone of its success has been the involvement of scientists, representatives from industry, and managers in project development, conduct. and knowledge transfer. Another cornerstone is its interdisciplinary mix of research themes: socioeconomic, technological, and biophysical. We are documenting where, when. and how people currently perceive, use, and benefit from the World Heritage Area and its resources, and how these may change under various future scenarios. We are seeking cost-effective ways for users to meet regulations on structures and wastewater and ballast-water disposal intended to protect the environment. This is done through a combination of critical assessments of the perceived hazard and development of guidelines that reflect that hazard. We are working to evaluate our network of no-take areas in terms of capacity to protect biodiversity and enhance regional fish stocks. We are commencing a parallel socioeconomic impact assessment to took at the effects of different options for closures on fishing communities. Since we will never be able to do biodiversity surveys over more than a small percentage of the entire World Heritage Area, we are developing geographic and physical surrogates to help define 'bioregions' to support planning for the distribution and size of no-take zones. We are linking with catchment scientists to assess the extent of cumulative and individual extreme runoff events. We are using spatial risk-assessment tools to map risks and return periods of impact on coral reefs by unmanageable and/or natural impacts such as floods, cyclones, and crown-of-thorns starfish, One of the major lessons learned has been that the involvement of research users in the research process has improved 'ownership' of the results of the research, and thus its capacity to effect social change in policy and management areas.

AB Despite universal recognition of coral reefs as the 'ocean's rainforest,' the focus of conservation is largely restricted to cnidarians, fish, larger sponges, and macroalgae. These span a wide taxonomic range and can be monitored non-invasively. But a biodiversity picture based on so few taxa is dismally incomplete. As in the rainforest, the overwhelming majority of species and clades on the reef are cryptic. Worms, mollusks, echinoderms, and crustaceans are numerically dominant, contribute to the trophic underpinning, and play pivotal ecological roles. Other than a few charismatic species (e.g., starfish, tube worms, conchs), they are underestimated and overassumed. Proper inventory of such taxa requires factors not routinely employed in conservation: physical sampling and systematic expertise, Yet scientifically robust results can be achieved with minimal damage and investment, and lead to recognition of key species, for which monitoring schemes can be developed. Examples of recent surveys by systematists are provided. involving echinoderms, mollusks, crustaceans, and worms from a variety of marine habitats, and each showing significant results. Despite this evidence of success, acquiring systematic expertise for inventorying marine invertebrates continues to be a limiting factor. After decades of de-emphasizing systematics, the cohort of trained systematists is aging and facing non-replacement, even in museums where extensive specimen collections, laboratories, and libraries provide the best available support for systematic work. In today's climate of biodiversity interest, new initiatives are attempting to reverse this trend. National Science Foundation's PEET [Partnerships for Enhancing Expertise in Taxonomy] Program is providing resources for training the next generation of taxonomists working on poorly known groups. At the international level, initiatives such as DIVERSITAS' Systematics Agenda 2000 International Program are supporting new agendas to document reef biodiversity and promote systematic inventory. The Convention on Biological Diversity is calling for more systematic inventories to facilitate their goals of conservation and sustainable development. Programmatic and financial support for inventories by national, regional, and local conservation and monitoring agencies are the next requirement.

AB Low-cost and environmentally sustainable coral reef restoration methods modeled after natural coral reef recovery processes and appropriate for use in developing countries were investigated. The study focused on post-fragmentation processes important to natural coral reef recovery and to successful transplantation, quantifying size-specific, substrate-specific, site-specific, and species-specific survival, growth, and self-attachment of coral fragments. Acropora cervicornis and A. prolifera, with distinct morphotypes from high and low energy environments were used for all experiments. Coral fragments of similar size from axial and basal regions were also tested to determine if senescence affects survival. Results indicate that the mortality and growth of unattached coral fragments are strongly size and substrate dependent, with insignificant differences between morphotypes, species, and sites. Axial fragments had significantly lower mortality than did inner/older fragments. Back reef and reef front morphotypes of A. cervicornis grown together in the sheltered back reef for I yr continued to differ significantly in branch diameter, relative growth, and self-attachment ability, indicating a genetic basis to morphology and adaptation to specific reef environments, Scattering coral fragments onto unstable rubble or attaching fragments to simple frames on sand proved effective for restoring coral cover to substrates where natural larval-based recruitment processes are inhibited.

CT International Conference on Scientific Aspects of Coral Reef Assessment
   Monitoring and Restoration
CY APR 14-16, 1999
CL FT LAUDERDALE, FLORIDA
AB Lack of knowledge about marine ecology and geochemistry perpetuates a strong tendency among policy makers to undervalue coral reefs, both biologically and economically, Moreover, present measures to promote and enhance coral reef research, preservation and restoration are hampered by fragmentation of political authority, rigidity of existing laws and institutions, and lack of precision in priority targeting. Of particular concern is the lack of strong and enforceable international climate accords to reduce risks of increased coral bleaching and declining reef calcification. The authors of this paper develop a set of policy tools, typologies and design approaches for improving public sector responses to coral management problems. Policy options are embedded within a larger framework of science-based decision making that is organized around two overarching issues: the need for action and the ability of governments to influence outcomes. Additional analytical frameworks are provided to assist marine scientists in improving policy and management decisions. Promising policies and programs are evaluated in terms of five key criteria: environmental effectiveness, cost-effectiveness (efficiency), priority responsiveness (targeting), equity, and sustainability.

TI The use of marine reserves in evaluating the dive fishery for the warty
   sea cucumber (Parastichopus parvimensis) in California, USA
SO CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
ID PSEUDOREPLICATION; MANAGEMENT; REFUGIA
AB Management of sustainable fisheries depends upon reliable estimates of stock assessment. Assessment of many stocks is based entirely on fishery-dependent data (e.g., catch per unit effort), which can be problematic. Here we use fishery-independent data on stock size, collected within and outside of no-take reserves before and after the onset of fishing, to evaluate the status of the dive fishery for warty sea cucumbers, Parastichopus parvimensis, in southern California. Long-term monitoring data showed that abundance decreased throughout the Channel Islands within 3-6 years after the onset of fishing. No significant changes in the abundance of P. parvimensis were observed at the two non-fished reserve sites, although densities tended to increase following onset of the fishery. Before-after, control-impact (BACI) analyses of seven fished and two non-fished sites implicated fishing mortality as the cause of 33-83% stock declines. In sharp contrast, stock assessment based on CPUE data showed no declines and a significant increase at one island. To date, most discussion on marine reserves has focused on the protection and enhancement of exploited populations. Our study demonstrates the critically important, but often overlooked, role that marine reserves can play in providing reliable information on stock assessment.

ID MARINE RESERVES; FISHERIES MANAGEMENT; REEF FISHERIES; CONSERVATION;
   MODEL; YIELD; AREAS; FISH
AB Harvest refuges have frequently been proposed as fishery management tools for species with sedentary adults and dispersive juveniles but less often for species with a highly mobile adult phase. In this paper, I use a population model to investigate the potential of using harvest refuges for managing species with both dispersive juveniles and mobile adults using the penaeid prawn Penaeus latisulcatus as a model. Maximum harvest occurred when only a very small proportion of the habitat (2-3%) was fished very heavily (F = 10). When only a small percentage of the habitat was trawled, harvest increased as fishing mortality increased, but when trawling was more extensive, harvest peaked with a relatively low fishing mortality. This supports recent contentions that by themselves, marine reserves are insufficient to manage a fishery effectively and that they need to be used in conjunction with effort restrictions. Sensitivity analyses indicated that adult, juvenile, and larval mortality are all near thresholds that qualitatively change model behaviour, but provided their values remain below the threshold, it is not important to know them accurately to determine the best harvest regime.

TI Using demographic methods to construct Bayesian priors for the intrinsic
   rate of increase in the Schaefer model and implications for stock
   rebuilding
SO CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
ID DECISION-ANALYSIS; EXAMPLE; GROWTH; FISH
AB Even though Bayesian methods can provide statistically rigorous assessments of the biological status of fisheries resources, uninformative data (e.g., declining catch rate series with little variation in fishing effort) can produce highly imprecise parameter estimates. This can be counteracted with the use of informative Bayesian prior distributions (priors) for model parameters. We develop priors for the intrinsic rate of increase (r) in the Schaefer surplus production model using demographic methods and illustrate the utility of this with an application to large coastal sharks in the Atlantic. In 1996, a U.S. stock assessment obtained a point estimate for r of 0.26. For such long-lived and low-fecund organisms, this could potentially be too high. Yet it was used to predict that within about 10 years, a 50% reduction in the 1995 catch level should result in > 50% chance of increasing the population to the abundance required to produce maximum sustainable yield. In contrast, a Bayesian assessment that used demographic analysis to construct a prior for r with a median of 0.07 and coefficient of variation (CV) of 0.7 indicated that within 30 years, this policy would have only a very small chance of increasing the population to maximum sustainable yield.

DE silvopastoral; systems animal selection; sustainable production
AB The effect of three exploitation intensities: A (high), B (medium) and C (low) on the botanical composition of selected pastures was studied in a silvopastoral system of a multi-associated legume and grass plot, Treatments were distributed according to a randomized block design with three replications and cows, with medium to low milk yields, were used in a balanced and replicated Latin square design, The multi-association consisted of the following species: Leucaena leucocephala cv. Cunningham, Neonatonia wighiii cv. Tinaroo, Teramnus labialis cv.. Centrocema pubescens cv. SIH-129, Stylosanthes guianenis cv. CIAT-184 and Panicum maximum (a mixture of Likoni and SIH-127 cultivars) and others already existing in the grassland. Samples of faeces were taken in the rainy season of 1995 and in the dry season of 1996. They were analyzed using the micro-histological technique, The botanical composition of the pasture showed high shrub legume values in both seasons (55.4 % in A. 51.0 % in B and 47.7 % in C during the rainy season and 54.7 % in A, 51,7 % in B and 48.2 % in C during the dry season), Likewise, legumes were predominant in the pastures selected and no significant differences were found between treatments with an average of 593 % in the rainy season and 58.7 % in the dry season and high diversity indicators (an average of 0,72 for both seasons). Legumes were also preferred to grasses. These differences were higher in the dry season, Results suggest that a silvopastoral system with species diversity and availability may favor the animal's ability to select increasing the consumption of nutritive pastures.

LA English
DT Article
ID RURAL CHINA; COMMON PROPERTY; TENURE; REFORM
AB It is widely perceived that the degradation of China's rangelands has accelerated since the introduction of rural reforms in the late 1970s. The popular explanation for this phenomenon has been that a 'tragedy of the commons' exists, as privately-owned livestock are being grazed on 'common' land. Since the passing of the Rangeland Law in 1985, Chinese pastoral tenure policy has emphasized the establishment of individual household tenure as a necessary condition for improving incentives for sustainable rangeland management, Yet household tenure has yet to be effectively established in many pastoral regions. The first objective of this article is to describe pastoral tenure arrangements in northern Xinjiang-Uygur Autonomous Region. Its second objective is to explain pastoral tenure arrangements, particularly the observed persistence of collective action. It is argued that there is no 'tragedy of the commons' and that it is characteristics of rangeland resources and the social environment that give rise to the particular types of institutional arrangements found.

TI Disaster mitigation and preparedness on the Nicaraguan post-Mitch agenda
SO DISASTERS
LA English
DT Article
DE disaster mitigation; disaster preparedness; NGOs; Nicaragua; Hurricane
   Mitch
AB Nicaragua provides an example of how a major disaster, in this case Hurricane Mitch, can transform the national agenda for disaster mitigation and preparedness. Hurricane Mitch was a reminder of how extremely disaster prone Nicaragua is, and also how neoliberal reforms have weakened governmental response capacity. In the face of critiques of how governmental policies had affected preparedness and response, discussions of this transformation became a highly politicised process where the debate over alternative development models tended to overshadow the original calls to strengthen risk management. Progress can be seen in some areas, such as disaster mitigation through environmental management. This study of NGO roles, and their relations with other kf,, actors, draws attention to the need to anchor improved risk management in local-lei,el NGO-government collaboration. Structures are being put into place to achieve this aim, but dependence on donor financing raises questions regarding the longer-term sustainability of these efforts.

DE maximum sustainable scale; optimal scale; biophysical assessments;
   prices; sustainable development
ID EFFICIENCY; SYSTEM
AB In a recent forum on biophysical assessments, a number of ecological economists expressed serious reservations about the use of prices to assess the appropriate scale of macroeconomic systems. While such reservations are warranted, the preference for biophysical assessments over prices indicates that many ecological economists are focussing on one notion of scale and neglecting another altogether. There are two notions of scale that are critical to achieving sustainable development (SD). One is the maximum sustainable macroeconomic scale; the other is the optimal macroeconomic scale. The maximum sustainable scale is the largest macroeconomic scale that can be sustained by a throughput of matter-energy that is within the ecosphere's regenerative and waste assimilative capacities. The optimal scale is a preferable macroeconomic scale and is one that is not only sustainable, but one that maximises the net benefits of economic activity. Biophysical assessments are needed to determine the maximum sustainable scale because ecological sustainability is a biophysical problem, not an economic problem. Thus. it is through biophysical assessments that the necessary restrictions on the incoming resource flow can be calculated and imposed. However, since the achievement of an optimal macroeconomic scale is an economic problem - albeit a constrained economic problem - relative prices are required to efficiently allocate the sustainable resource flow so the macroeconomy can adjust to the optimum. Failure to recognise the two notions of scale and the most appropriate means of their assessment is likely to thwart rather than advance the movement toward SD. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Wants may be distinguished by the extent to which they are 'positional'. Positional wants are determined by one's frame of reference, defined by comparison with peer-group consumption and by one's own previous consumption. The growth in positional wants is not uniquely related to environmental resource depletion but the two do strongly overlap. Several implications follow. First, social reductions in positional consumption may yield environmental benefits at little cost to consumers. The costs are, however, spread over time and depend on the rate of adaptation. The strength of the social-reference effect determines whether individuals are subject to an 'isolation' or an 'assurance' problem and, hence, the degree to which cuts need to be centrally imposed if they are to succeed. It is suggested that the negative consequences of international positioning could be ameliorated by the replacement of conventional income accounts by a welfare index that more fully incorporates environmental costs, Secondly, the neoclassical utility function can be regarded as a special case of the reference-based welfare function, provided that it is restricted to positive explanations of how momentary choices are made. Reference-based preferences have more in common with the findings of psychologists and, hence, open a way to consilience between economics and natural science. Finally, the frame of reference also allows a dynamic perspective to the debate on the commensurability of wants. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Quota management systems (QMS) have become a popular method in fisheries management. Unfortunately, good data is rarely available for setting robust total allowable catch (TAC) limits. TACs are often set based on previous yields or estimates of natural mortality rates and may be adjusted in response to new data or even political pressures. This paper presents a discrete time, age structured, single species fishery model with dynamic TAC adjustment. The model can be used to explore a range of TAC adjustment strategies in the absence of fishery population data, The model was created in the STELLA modeling software. It is modular and may be extended to support the study of other fisheries, management systems and economic considerations. This paper applies the model to a hypothetical new fishery. Results suggest that TACs may be adjusted rather aggressively based on previous catches to achieve the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) without significant risk to the fishery.

ID ECOSYSTEM SERVICES
AB Sustainable use of the planet is based on the assumption that social evolution and changed human behavior can produce a sustainable society. This paradigm is vastly different from the notion that humans possess a common set of rigid, genetically specified behavioral predilections that are unlikely to be altered by circumstances. This manuscript examines two beliefs that are arguably root causes of the present human predicament.
   Exceptionalists believe that some humans are vastly exceptional to most humans and, as a consequence, are entitled to a markedly disproportionate share of the planet's resources. In addition, humans are regarded as entitled to a vastly disproportionate share of the planet's resources compared with other species, for the same reason. Exemptionalists believe that human ingenuity, technology, and creativity free them from the iron laws of nature that limit and control other species. Both views constitute major obstacles to achieving sustainable use of the planet and require rigorous reexamination if sustainability is to be achieved.

AB With the current struggle to "sustainably" exploit our biosphere, the "paradox of enrichment" remains an issue that is just as relevant today as it was when it was first formalized by Rosenzweig in 1971. This paradox is relevant because it predicts that attempts to sustain a population by making its food supply more abundant (e.g., by nutrient enrichment) may actually have the reverse (paradoxical) effect of destabilizing the network. Originally, this paradox was based upon studies of "reasonable," but quite simple, predator-prey models. Here, we attempt a more "realistic" revision of the paradox that explicitly accounts for the embedded nature of the human system in a complexly interwoven set of hierarchical (spatial, temporal, and organizational) relations with the rest of the ecosphere-a relationship whose exploitative nature continues to grow in intensity and extent. This revision is attempted with the aid of a combined thermodynamic and network approach. The result is that a scale-dependent asymmetry in the action of the second law of thermodynamics is shown-an asymmetry that results in the creation of two antagonistic propensities: local order and local disorder. The point of balance between these two propensities is empirically measurable and represents a balance between processes and constraints internal (growth and development) and external (interactive and perturbing influences) to a system-a balance that may be called the most "adaptive" state (after Conrad 1983). The use of such an index of this balance is demonstrated and it is used to clarify the relevance of the paradox to more complexly organized systems. As a consequence, we conclude that the concept of "sustainable exploitation and growth" is an oxymoron.

TI Ecological modernisation as a framework for sustainable development: a

SO ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING A

ID LOCAL-GOVERNMENT
AB Sweden has long been an acknowledged leader in Europe in terms of its commitment to environmental protection linked with ecologically based technological innovation, and to social democratisation and high levels of welfare provision. Following the 1992 UN Conference on Environment and Development in Rio, Agenda 21 was received warmly as codifying an existing determination to pursue development which may be sustainable. However, over the last decade the economy has come under increasing pressure from globalisation and social change. Although the environmental agenda remains strong, a schism seems to be developing with key socioeconomic drivers. The Swedish government has responded with a policy framework of ecological modernisation, through which it hopes to regain the high ground economically, environmentally, and socially. We report on a study for the Swedish Research Councils in which we explore aspects of this national policy framework, and how it is being interpreted in selected projects in Sweden's three major cities and two case-study towns. We examine tensions in integration and implementation; and argue that Swedish norms may favour an unduly 'expert' and even 'technocorporatist' view of sustainable development which its current ecological modernisation programme does tittle to address. We discuss the cultural and institutional change which may be required if the current conception of ecological modernisation is to deliver development which is sustainable.

TI A decade on: reflections on the Resource Management Act 1991 and the
   practice of urban planning in New Zealand
SO ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING B-PLANNING & DESIGN
LA English
DT Article
AB The radical restructuring of New Zealand's planning system in 1991 was based on the Resource Management Act and significant amendments to the Local Government Act 1974. In this paper we report a study of urban planning in New Zealand under this new regime. Amendments to the Local Government Act were designed in large part to facilitate the administration of the Resource Management Act, the authors of which wanted to emphasise the sustainable management of the biophysical environment and dramatically to limit local government's involvement in urban and social planning. Ironically, the strategic planning provisions of the amended Local Government Act gave local government contradictory powers. We discuss the nature of this contradiction and its impacts on the ways in which district planning under the Resource Management Act and strategic planning under the Local Government Act have combined to create new and unforseen approaches to urban planning and management in New Zealand.

AB A constrained cellular automata (CA) model based on 'grey cells' for the simulation of different types of urban forms and developments is developed within a raster GIS. Remote sensing and GIS are used to supply information on environmental constraints and locations of growth centers for the simulation. The model is able to consider different criteria, such as urban forms, environmental suitability, and land consumption for the planning of sustainable cities. Seven different types of urban forms and developments that range from compact-monocentric, compact-polycentric, compact-monocentric-environmental, compact-polycentric-environmental, dispersed, highly dispersed, to very highly dispersed developments were simulated by using the model. The model can generate urban forms and developments with fractal structures that are close to real cities. The simulated patterns were evaluated by using different cost indicators related to sustainable development principles.

AB Development planning is multidimensional in nature. On the one hand, it addresses economic growth, and on the other, it deals with economic development of the whole nation. Sustainable development, on the other hand, emphasizes the need for integration of economics and environment, as well as promoting intra- and intergenerational equity. While the literature deals extensively with the issues of sustainable development, it lacks a prescription of an easy-to-use, yet rigorous, methodology for it. In this paper, we offer a decision conferencing approach to sustainable development planning based on a multicriteria model. The integrated model is presented and applied to a sustainable development planning exercise in a third world country. Sample results are presented and detailed sensitivity analyses show the environmental variables that are of major concern. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A concept of the integrated approach in designing multidisciplinary decision support systems (DSS) based on agricultural scenarios for sustainable catchment management is discussed. A principle of holism underlying the integrated approach to DSS design is formulated. For a model to be viable and sustainable, it should be based on scenarios that are plausible and highly typical from the point of view of those 'doing' agriculture. Problems concerning principles of scenario formulation within the integrated approach are considered. A notion of 'prototype' scenarios based on 'joint venture' of modellers and stakeholders is proposed. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Sustainability is not a new concept but rather a prominent concept at the present time. Researchers have categorized sustainability indicators into economic, social, and ecological aspects. Sustainability of agriculture in the context of development efforts has to meet production efficiency, resilience of ecosystems, appropriate technology, maintenance of the environment, cultural diversity, and satisfaction of the basic needs. The research objective of this study is to determine the critical indicators of agricultural sustainability in the Mae Chaem Catchment, northern Thailand. In assessing sustainability, the authors applied the sustainability indicator analysis developed by FAO. The results of the study show that food sufficiency in the Wat Chan subcatchment is the most sustainable aspect of agriculture. The least sustainable facets of agriculture in the Wat Chan subcatchment are land holding size, land tenure, and water shortage. While expansion of agricultural land in the watershed area is not legally permitted, a practice of agroforestry is recommended. Insecure land tenure may result in reduced incentives to improve land productivity. Thus, official recognition of land ownership is required. As the problem of water shortage is most critical in the lower reaches, increased participation in the allocation scheme by downstream villagers should be encouraged. Finally, the construction of a small-scale water storage in the lower part of the catchment to increase water supply should be considered. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB To ensure the sustainability of land systems in terms of nutrient cycling and maintenance of soil physical conditions, there is a need to understand soil organic matter (SOM) and its dynamics. lt has been suggested that soil-carbon (C) models developed internationally do not perform well under New Zealand's unique climatic and soil mineralogical conditions. To test this hypothesis, we conducted C-14-labelled ryegrass decomposition studies and assessed the influence of abiotic factors on decomposition rates. These factors were characterized by estimating system mean residence times (MRTs) from estimates of first-order rate coefficients in a simple, three-compartment model. A range of MRTs obtained for decomposition was related to climatic conditions and soil properties. We summarise this work and extend this study to apply the Rothamsted soil-C turnover model, a five-compartment model, to our data with the view of testing both the model projections and the decomposability factors assumed in the model.

AB CSIRO Sustainable Ecosystems is constructing a spatially explicit modelling system capable of exploring alternative land and water policy alternatives against plausible price, cost, and climate scenarios for the next 20 years. INSIGHT will be used to identify the likely impacts of land and water policy options on regional economies and structural adjustment. Flowcharts have been constructed for most of the major crop and pasture and associated economic models for commodities produced in the Lachlan River Catchment of New South Wales. This enabled the most important components and interrelationships within these models to be readily identified. The next step has been to construct models at the regional scale that contain the essential elements of the more-detailed point models. The paper describes the progress to date in describing these models, and how they have been integrated into a coordinated agricultural crop production evaluation system.

DE fire; grazing; tropical savannas; modelling
AB As savannas are widespread across northern Australia and provide northern rangelands, the sustainable use of this landscape is crucial. Both fire and grazing are known to influence the tree-grass character of tropical savannas. Frequent fires open up the tree layer and change the ground layer from perennials to that dominated by annuals. Annual species in turn produce copious quantities of highly flammable fuel that perpetuates frequent, hot fires. Grazing reduces fuel loads because livestock consumes fuel-forage. This trade-off between fire and grazing was modelled using a spatially explicit, process-orientated model (SAVANNA) and field data from fire experiments performed in the Victoria River District of northern Australia. Results of simulating fire (over 40 years) with minimal or no grazing pressure revealed a reduction in the shrub and woody plants, a reduction in grasses, and no influence on the tree structure given mild fires. While mature trees were resistant to fire, immature trees, which are more likely associated with the shrub layer, were removed by fire. The overall tree density may be reduced with continual burning over longer time periods because of increasing susceptibility of old trees to fire and the lack of recruitment. Increases in stocking rates created additional forage demands until the majority of the fuel load was consumed, thus effectively suppressing fire and reverting to the grazing and suppressed fire scenario where trees and shrubs established.

AB In the north-western Peruvian Amazon, a new road has recently been constructed to link the city of Iquitos with the town of Nauta. The road crosses lands that are remarkably heterogeneous in terms of ecological conditions, comprising distinctive soil types from extremely poor to relatively fertile. Although this reality contributes to the land use potential and human carrying capacity of each place, deforestation of road margins appears equally intensive on all types of land. In the mid-1990s, two dead-end roads starting from both urban centres were characterized by distinctive zones of resource exploitation, with a road-free section of primary forest in between. A few years later, the separate road ends were linked by a dirt road that served only occasional traffic, but introduced significant new settlement. Various developmental trends evidence incoherent resource management and momentary public support in the region. By promoting diverse economic activities that reflect environmental conditions in the initial land use planning and land allocation, most sections along this road could be considered economically valuable for purposes such as sustainable forestry, tourism, agroforestry and, in suitable sites, intensive agriculture. To promote the more sustainable uses, thorough environmental legislation, administrative guidelines and follow-up based on an implicit mechanism of learning from previous experiences should be implemented. At the local level, there are some important initiatives to support such development, including ecological and economic zoning. However, these measures might be too late to prevent the destructive practices so common in many parts of Amazonia.

AB Protected area visitation is an important component of ecotourism, and as such, must be sustainable. However, protected area visitation may degrade natural resources, particularly in areas of concentrated visitor activities like trails and recreation sites. This is an important concern in ecotourism destinations such as Belize and Costa Rica, because they actively promote ecotourism and emphasize the pristine qualities of their natural resources. Research on visitor impacts to protected areas has many potential applications in protected area management, though it has not been widely applied in Central and South America. This study targeted this deficiency through manager interviews and evaluations of alternative impact assessment procedures at eight protected areas in Belize and Costa Rica. Impact assessment procedures included qualitative condition class systems, ratings systems, and measurement-based systems applied to trails and recreation sites. The resulting data characterize manager perceptions of impact problems, document trail and recreation site impacts, and provide examples of inexpensive, efficient and effective rapid impact assessment procedures. Interview subjects reported a variety of impacts affecting trails, recreation sites, wildlife, water, attraction features and other resources. Standardized assessment procedures were developed and applied to record trail and recreation site impacts. Impacts affecting the study areas included trail proliferation, erosion and widening, muddiness on trails, vegetation cover loss, soil and root exposure, and tree damage on recreation sites. The findings also illustrate the types of assessment data yielded by several alternative methods and demonstrate their utility to protected area managers. The need for additional rapid assessment procedures for wildlife, water, attraction feature and other resource impacts was also identified.

AB There has been a rapid expansion in the commercial cultivation of genetically modified crops, rising from the first plantings in 1995 to 44.5 million hectares worldwide in 2000, most of which have grown in North America. Though there are sharp divisions in opinions on benefits and risk, genetic modification (GM) does not represent a single, homogenous technology. Each application brings different potential benefits and risks for different stakeholders. This paper reviews recent scientific progress and future applications using a new typology of three generations of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) ranged against five types of scientific application. Agricultural GMOs pose a range of potential environmental and health risks. An analysis of recent independent field and scientific evidence from industrialized countries summarizes the current state of knowledge on seven types of risk that apply to all agricultural systems: (1) horizontal gene flow; (2) new forms of resistance and pest problems; (3) recombination to produce new pathogens; (4) direct and indirect effects of novel toxins; (5) loss of biodiversity from changes to farm practices; (6) allergenic and immune system reactions; and (7) antibiotic resistance marker genes. There remain highly contrasting positions taken by different stakeholders over GMOs. A review of three debates explains claims and counter-claims for (1) genetic modification as technological fix or contributor to sustainability; (2) genetic modification as driver of corporate power or friend of farmer; and (3) genetic modification as feeder of the world or eliminator of alternatives.

AB The hypothesis of attaching and realising market values as one means of conserving biodiversity has gained ground over the last decade. This has been challenged recently after examination of a number of case studies, largely from tropical Amazonia, on high value logging, marketing of non-timber forest products, and bioprospecting. The conclusion was that market-orientated conservation has seldom generated the financial returns envisaged, and as such cannot be used as an incentive to prevent land transformation. This paper reviews the basis of the challenge to market-orientated conservation on a number of grounds, drawing on examples largely from southern Africa. It concludes that generalizations from tropical Amazonia regarding the failure of market-orientated conservation are probably premature, and that it should remain an option, amongst a number of options, for conservation of biodiversity. Additionally, the prerequisite criteria identified as necessary to create an enabling framework for the success of market-orientated conservation are insufficient. Case studies are presented where the prerequisites do not apply, yet current extraction for market purposes is sustainable. Other potential prerequisites are also considered. There is a need for multivariate analysis, based on a large sample size drawn from across a range of environments and resources, of which factors are important prerequisites for successful market-orientated conservation, and under which circumstances.

AB This paper analyses a model in which both economic and ecological relationships as well as all the interactions between the two are fully specified. It compares the short term and the long term effects of shocks in environmental policies. It appears that short run effects may differ substantially from long run effects, with respect to both levels and growth rates of various variables. Though in the short run growth optimists may be right, in the long run there appears to be, under the chosen specification, a trade-off between economic growth and environmental quality.

AB We are increasingly needing ways to secure patterns of development that be sustainable, that is, environmentally, socially and economically appropriate for us and for future generations. Sustainability indicators are a promising tool that would allow us to "land" the concept, supporting the way in which decisions are made. In Chile there are few experiences on the subject. This paper presents the work carried out to develop sustainability indicators in four regions. The paper focuses on the lessons that have been drawn from the experience.

TI Network management and information systems in promotion of urban
   economic development: Some reflections from CityWeb of Tampere
SO EUROPEAN PLANNING STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
AB Partnership relations have become more important in promotion of urban economic development. Efforts have been made to create such networks by which to strive for new markets or political arenas and so to extend the resource base of the urban region. The objective in the creation of networks is the most efficient mobilization possible of the know-how and resources in the urban region and external to it. These observations inevitably prompt the following questions: How can the quality of cooperative processes be improved and how can networks and various development projects be managed? It seems evident that information and its conscious management play a crucial role in seeking answers to these questions. Simultaneously such questions emerge as to how network management can respond to the increasing amount of information and the demands for rapid learning. How can the vast flood of information and knowledge in the networks be managed, how can essential features be extracted, i.e. how can a sustainable basis for perceptions be created? One possible answer, among others, to these questions is information systems utilizing modern information technology. This paper focuses on urban development networks and especially at how their efficiency can be promoted by network management and by modern information systems. The case described and tentatively analysed is the information system CityWeb of Tampere urban region, Finland.

TI Constant catch or constant harvest rate? The Baltic Sea cod (Gadus
   morhua L.) fishery as a modelling example

AB Overfishing is a major problem in the world fisheries. Constant harvest rate strategies, with catches proportional to the abundance of the target species, stimulates investments when stock sizes are large, often resulting in an overcapacity when the stocks decrease. These investment incentives are weaker under a constant catch strategy, since there are less reasons to have a catching and fish processing capacity that is larger than the allowed constant catch. We have explored the potential of a management strategy based on constant catches, by modelling the fishery on the eastern Baltic Sea cod (Gadus morhua L.). To avoid the low long-term yield (LTY) often resulting from a strict constant catch approach, we developed a quasi-constant catch (QCC) strategy based on alternative constant catch levels and two overfishing criteria. Normal catches are allowed when the spawning stock biomass is above a certain level. When the spawning stock biomass falls below this level, catches are reduced to a given extent. If the spawning stock biomass falls below a second and lower threshold, the fishery is closed. The QCC strategy was tested with a model based on the same basic premises as the multi-species virtual population analyses (MSVPA) for Baltic Sea cod, developed within ICES. In addition, recruitment processes were included and probability analyses were done to estimate different risks of overfishing. According to the model, the LTY with the QCC strategy was 10% lower than with the constant harvest rate strategy. However, the QCC approach had the advantage of smaller variation in catches, potentially resulting in a better utilisation of the fishery capacity. The capacity utilisation was better with the QCC strategy relative to the constant harvest rate strategy, especially in fisheries where catch quotas are based on assessments with substantial errors. Furthermore, QCC gave a better capacity utilisation in fisheries where the size of the fleet and processing capacity is non-flexible and when effective fish finding techniques are used. A more effective capacity utilisation could counterbalance the disadvantage of the lower LTY compared to the constant harvest rate strategy. The QCC approach is hence an interesting and competitive management strategy, that is likely to be more effective in avoiding the emergence overcapitalisation and overfishing of long-lived species like the Baltic cod. QCC may also allow catch quotas to be set for more than 1 year, provided that the stock size of the target species is relatively large. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Flood plains comprise over 12% of the lowland Peruvian Amazon, and they are economically important in agriculture, fishing, hunting, forestry and extraction of other forest products. Some special features of the flood plains are outlined and their implications for land-use are interpreted. A close interaction exists between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, implying that management needs to consider effects on both systems. By nature the flood plains are adapted to large perturbations, indicating that rough management interventions can be carried out, but only a limited proportion of each habitat is disturbed by nature at a time, suggesting that simultaneous profound large-scale interventions in certain habitats should be avoided. The high fertility of flood plain soils and periodical sedimentation hint that the risk of soil nutrient depletion is limited. The flood plain production potential is relatively high, although it varies much according to patterns of flooding and drainage, stressing the need to provide information on the geographic variation in these environmental factors. The culture and organisation of flood plain inhabitants is dynamic, and a patron system dominate in many economic activities. Few regulations control the access to and use of the flood plain natural resources, and no permanent tenure rights can be issued for flood plain land. This emphasises the need to promote adapted organisations and institutions, and to develop a land tenure system fostering incentives for management working on a long-term perspective. It was found that sustained timber production in the natural flood plain forests can have net present values (NTFPs) up to US$ 250 per ha without accounting for growth enhancing effects. On the average the extraction value of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) was low, but certain habitats generated high economic benefits constituting a major part of the economy of many flood plain households. Domestication has a high potential and agroforestry is already widespread, but effects of flooding, bad drainage and risk of erosion by the river current are impediments to successful intensive land-use systems. Socio-economic distortions can be risked if land suited for agricultural subsistence production is gradually taken over by agriculturalists focusing on large-scale commercial production.

LA English

DE rural development; forest policy; social representations;
   socio-political discourse; European Union
AB A major part of the territory of the European Union consists of rural areas, and consequently considerable attention is given to a European policy on rural development. Forestry is increasingly recognised as one of the activities to be considered in such development, However, there are different opinions about how forestry can best contribute to rural development. This is due to both the various meanings attributed to the concepts of rurality and rural development, and the changing perceptions about the precise role of forestry. In the past, most attention was focused on the primary production function of forests in order to stimulate the economic advancement of rural areas. At present, the role of forestry is gradually changing, with increasing attention being given to its ecological and amenity services. This paper explores the different perceptions on the role of forestry by means of a tentative identification of different discourses. First, the different meanings of rurality and rural development are reviewed. Rural areas may be characterised either by empirical, socio-cultural or spatial parameters, or through social representations. Such a social representation can be considered as 'symbolic shorthand' for giving meaning to a specific area. ft is expressed through discourse. Five ideal, typical discourses on rural development are identified, i.e. the agri-ruralist, the hedonist, the utilitarian, the community sustainability and the nature conservation discourses. Secondly, the perceived role of forestry within each discourse is identified in four different types of rural areas, varying from remote rural areas to areas adjacent to urban agglomerations.

AB Once so effective in providing sustained-yield conservation values, visions and models for the Western worlds' transition to an industrial society, it is time again for foresters (plus many other types of forest managers and users) to re-think the role of rural economies and their forest ecosystems in the urban, post-industrial, global societies of North America and Europe. Our paper is an overview of traditional vs. emerging values and views about the role of forest management and managers in rural economic development. Much traditional forestry thinking is evolving today into more comprehensive, integrated forest ecosystem management and rural economic development concepts. For example, traditional sustained-yield models are expanding into ecosystem-based sustainability concepts; emphasis on the economic growth of forest products sectors is evolving into broader, sustainable community socioeconomic development; and the management of community sociopolitical conflict over forest management is beginning to be recognized as a sustainability consideration equally important as forest biological constraints. These all contribute to making public forest management today much more: (1) ecosystem-based and landscape-scale, (2) that incorporates diverse social values or uses; and (3) is interrelated with many community socioeconomic and political systems from local to regional to national and super-regional (e.g. the European Community).

TI Reconciling the electricity industry with sustainable development:
   backcasting - a strategic alternative
SO FUTURES
LA English
DT Article
AB The concept of sustainability has emerged from a recognition that all terrestrial systems, be they natural or human, are interconnected, and cannot, therefore, be adequately understood through reductionist analysis. Such an understanding has fundamental implications for the policy making process. While specialist knowledge remains an essential prerequisite in the development of effective 'sustainability' policies, it is not in itself sufficient. An equally important, and all too often neglected, component, is the understanding and insight gained from synthesising detailed and disparate information from across a range of disciplines. With this in mind, this paper builds on Lovin's and Robinson's earlier 'backcasting' work to suggest an alternative strategic structure for reconciling a reliable and affordable electricity industry with the broad tenets of sustainable development. Within this alternative model, electricity demand, as well as supply, becomes an endogenous factor in the policy making process. Moreover, the model essentially rejects the mechanistic optimisation underpinning both the contemporary market model and the earlier planned structure of the electricity industry. By contrast, the backcast proposed here embraces wider environmental and social responsibilities through a more circumspect appreciation Of Current knowledge and hence a more flexible and responsive policy agenda.

   perpetual sites; environmental performance and monitoring
AB Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) landfills world-wide are experiencing the consequences of conventional landfilling techniques, whereby anaerobic conditions are created within the landfill waste. Under anaerobic conditions, slow stabilization of the waste mass occurs, producing methane, (an explosive, 'greenhouse' gas) and toxic leachate over long periods of time. As a potential solution, it was demonstrated that the aerobic degradation of MSW within a landfill can significantly increase the rate of waste decomposition and settlement, decrease the production of methane gas, reduce the level of toxic organics in the leachate and decrease quantities of landfill leachate that need treatment. This paper summarizes the successful results of two separate aerobic landfill projects located in Georgia (USA) and discusses the potential economic and environmental impacts to world-wide solid waste management.

TI Introducing centralised wastewater treatment in Bangkok: a study of
   factors determining its acceptability
SO HABITAT INTERNATIONAL
LA English
DT Article
DE wastewater in Bangkok; acceptability of wastewater; willingness to pay
AB Water pollution is a problem all over the world and also in Thailand and particularly in Bangkok. The Government of Thailand and the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration have realised the seriousness of the problem and have started the construction of centralised wastewater treatment systems. The idea of centralised wastewater treatment is new for Bangkok where wastewater is normally treated on-site in septic tanks. The start-up and operational costs of a wastewater treatment system are high. The success and the sustainability of the system require the support of the Bangkok population. In order to gain this support, a better knowledge and understanding of the environmental concerns of the Bangkok population, their willingness to pay for environmental improvements and the acceptability of a wastewater treatment project is needed. The study applied the theory of diffusion and adoption to examine the acceptance of the project by the residents of Bangkok, the contingent valuation method to analyse the willingness to pay of Bangkok residents and the theory of environmental psychology to investigate the factors influencing acceptance of the wastewater treatment project by Bangkok residents. Personal questionnaire interview surveys and the willingness-to-pay were used to provide information on these issues. The Bangkok residents were found to prefer a centralised system, but they had no clear preference for a cost recovery system. The majority preferred the convenience and easy comprehension of a volumetric flat rate system. Two-thirds of the respondents preferred a separate collection system and expressed a preference for the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration as the fee-collecting agency. Most were willing to pay Baht 86.87 per month or Baht 3.28 per m(3) (Baht 25 = US$1), while the rate proposed by the BMA is Baht 3.50 per m(3). Distance to a klong (canal) and the direct experience of polluted surface water did not have any influence on the preferences. Monthly household income, level of education and environmental awareness were the principal factors that influenced acceptability of various aspects of the wastewater treatment system. However, acceptability declined when direct costs and changes in life style were involved. The conclusions of the study support the claim that the process of acceptance of wastewater treatment in Bangkok is closely related to the concept of adoption. The study found that complex stimuli, such as cost-effectiveness and the convenience of the technology, tend to influence the acceptability of the wastewater treatment project by Bangkok residents. In order to be able to introduce measures that require sacrifices from the population, the BMA should undertake campaigns of public hearings, public education and public surveys to know public opinion and the public's willingness to pay.

TI Sustainable growth, the DuPont way
SO HARVARD BUSINESS REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
AB Like many manufacturers, DuPont traditionally has grown by making more and more "stuff." And its business growth has been proportional to the amount of raw materials and energy used - as well as the resulting waste and emissions from operations. Over the years, though, DuPont became aware that cheap supplies of nonrenewable resources wouldn't be endlessly available and that the earth's ecosystems couldn't indefinitely absorb the waste and emissions of production and consumption.
   Chad Holliday, chairman and CEO of DuPont, believes strongly in the challenge of sustainable growth and makes the business case for it: By using creativity and scientific knowledge effectively, he says, companies can provide strong returns for shareholders and grow their businesses while also meeting the human needs of societies around the world and reducing the environmental footprint of their operations and products. in fact, a focus on sustainability can help identify new products, markets, partnerships, and intellectual property and lead to substantial business growth.
   Holliday describes how DuPont developed a three-pronged strategy to translate the concept of sustainability into nuts-and-bolts business practices. Focusing on integrated science, knowledge intensity, and productivity improvement, the strategy was accompanied by a new way to measure progress quantitatively.
   Sustainable growth should be viewed not as a program for stepped-up environmental performance but as a comprehensive way of doing business, one that delivers tremendous economic value and opens up new opportunities. Ultimately, companies PAR find that they can generate substantial business value through sustainability while both enhancing the quality of life around the world and protecting the environment.

TI Scaling-up HIV/AIDS and TB home-based care: Lessons from Zambia
SO HEALTH POLICY AND PLANNING
LA English
DT Article
AB Home-based care coverage in Africa is currently very low and likely to reduce drastically in the near future. This paper investigates the low coverage of home-based care programmes in Africa and uses two home-based care projects in Zambia as case studies. The very limited involvement of governments in the provision of home-based care services appears to be one of the main reasons behind the low coverage of home-based care in Africa. Governments therefore should provide some form of basic home-based care services and/or strengthen support to other institutions providing home-based care. In order to facilitate governments' involvement in home-based care activities, an analysis of tasks performed by community nurses and volunteers is used to identify tasks that government, missionary or NGO employed nurses may be able to provide without, or with very limited, donor assistance. However, further research and development is needed to develop affordable, feasible and sustainable home care programmes that can be implemented by staff working in government, NGO and missionary health facilities. In addition, innovative strategies are required to establish effective partnerships between the NGO, missionary and government health facilities.

TI Research in action: the training approach of the Joint Health Systems
   Research Project for the Southern African region
SO HEALTH POLICY AND PLANNING

ID SCIENCE RESEARCH; NETWORK
AB Over the last two decades, capacity-building in health research has been recognized as a priority by the international research community. Since 1987 the Joint Health Systems Research (HSR) Project for the Southern African Region has been making efforts to increase the national expertise for operational health research, starting in ten Southern African countries, in order to strengthen decision-making in health care at all levels. Initially, its targets were health managers and public health staff. Step-by-step, staff of different levels and disciplines have, in small groups, developed and implemented research protocols on problems experienced in their own working environment. The recommendations resulting from over 200 studies could, to a large extent, be implemented by the teams themselves. The Project was characterized by a flexible approach, allowing countries to participate at their own speed and to determine their own activities and the support they needed. As Ministries of Health as well as research institutions, in an increasing number of Southern and Eastern African countries, choose to actively participate in HSR, this has contributed to bridge the gap between the academic world and the health field. Still, sustainability of HSR activities remains a challenge.
   This paper describes the approach of the Joint HSR Project over the first 10 years of its operation, and its major strengths and limitations.

DE healthy community; partnerships; social capital; sustainable development
AB The Victorian-era journal The Sanitarian used on its masthead the slogan A nation's health is a nation's wealth'. Today, we are re-discovering that wisdom, recognizing that health is indeed a form of wealth. Moreover, we are beginning to understand that wealth is not merely our economic capital, but includes three other forms of capital-social, natural and human capital. Health is one key element of human capital. A healthy community is one that has high levels of social, ecological, human and economic 'capital', the combination of which may be thought of as 'community capital'. The challenge for communities in the 21st century will be to increase all four forms of capital simultaneously. This means working with suitable partners in the private sector, making human development the central purpose of governance, and more closely integrating social, environmental and economic policy. Community gardens, sustainable transportation systems and energy conservation programmes in community housing projects are some of the ways in which we can build community capital.

DT Article
DE health promotion; health promoting hospitals; organizational
   arrangements; organizational change; re-orientation of health services
AB This paper draws on a review of the literature about the types of health promotion activities conducted by health promoting hospitals and an observation of how some Australian hospitals have structured the organizational arrangements to be more health promoting. This paper also draws on the experiences of one of the authors (A.J.) in managing and evaluating an organizational change process at a major specialist hospital in Adelaide, South Australia, that sought to re-orientate the hospital towards placing more emphasis on health promotion. From these three sources, a typology of four approaches of organizational arrangement to health promotion is presented. These approaches are: 'doing a health promotion project, 'delegating it to the role of a specific division, department or staff'; 'being a health promotion setting; and 'being a health promotion setting and improving the health of the community'. For the re-orientation of the specialist hospital to occur and be sustainable, the research indicated that over the case study period of 1994-1998 there had to be strong organizational commitment to change, supported at multiple levels of the organization, and reflected in policy and practice change. The paper concludes that more evaluative research of this type will be important if the rhetoric of healthy settings is to become a reality.

AB This article presents a collaboration approach to assimilate the best practice of concurrent engineering (CE) in a small manufacturing enterprise for gaining sustainable improvements. The major challenge in CE is sharing a mental model of parallel working across departments in a company to shorten the cycle time, and across organizations to form a supply chain for global competition. Action learning is found useful to develop self-discipline in individuals to initiate changes and align the views with others both inside and outside the company for a vested interest to use information systems to make innovations for gaining competitive advantage.

AB In the 1990s, microfinance emerged as the leading development strategy adopted to alleviate poverty and empower the "poor," particularly women. Views differ, however, on the extent to which access to financial services can enhance participants' quality of life. This paper addresses this ongoing debate by analyzing a new (mid-1997) microfinance program in the northern Philippines established by the Central Cordillera Agricultural Programme (CECAP). Focusing on women's work in crafts, this paper argues that CECAP has initially focused on achieving financial self-sustainability within the short time frame allotted to the project, rather than emphasizing social change objectives. In so doing, primarily those women with already existing businesses or microentrepreneurs, not the "poor," a-re benefiting from the system; and many women are behind in their loan repayments. The fluctuating demand for crafts prevents entrepreneurs from passing on gains to small producers. By stressing timely loan repayments and not considering the broader socioeconomic and class infrastructure, CECAP's microfinance program has failed to build borrowers' collective agency and empowerment. This paper suggests that for microfinance to contribute to the needs of its members, programs must enfold social initiatives other than credit.

AB The reversal of freshwater acidification in the low mountain ranges of Germany is of public, political and scientific concern, because these regions are near natural ecosystems and function as an important drinking water supply. The aim of this study was to evaluate the status and trends of acidification reversal after two decades of reduced anthropogenic deposition in selected freshwaters of the low mountain ranges in the Harz, the Fichtelgebirge, the Bavarian Forest, the Spessart and the Black Forest. In response to decreased sulphate deposition, seven out of nine streams investigated had significantly decreasing sulphate concentrations (all trends were calculated with the Seasonal Kendall Test). The decrease in sulphate concentration was only minor, however, due to the release of previously stored soil sulphur. No increase was found in pH and acid neutralising capacity (defined by Reuss and Johnson, 1986). Aluminum concentrations in the streams did not decrease. Thus, no major acidification reversal can currently be noted in spite of two decades of decreased acid deposition. Nevertheless, the first signs of improvement in water quality were detected as there was a decrease in the level and frequency of extreme values of pH, acid neutralising capacity and aluminium concentrations in streams. With respect to nitrogen, no change was determined for either nitrate or ammonium concentrations in precipitation or stream water. Base cation fluxes indicate increasing net loss of base cations from all ecosystems investigated, which could be interpreted as an increase in soil acidification. The latter was due to a combination of continued high anion leaching and significant reduction of base cation deposition. No major improvement was noted in biological recovery, however, initial signs of recovery were detectable as there was re-occurrence of some single macroinvertebrate species which were formerly extinct. The results of this study have important implications for water authorities, forest managers and policy makers: the delay in acidification reversal suggests a need for ongoing intensive amelioration of waters, a careful selection of management tools to guarantee sustainable management of forests and the reduction of nitrogen deposition to prevent further acidification of soils and waters.

AB A study was conducted during 1993-98 on sandy-loam soil to find out the production sustainability and economic viability under various levels of irrigation on 5 cropping systems, viz upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.)-wheat (Triticum aestivum L. emend. Fiori & Paul.). desi cotton (Gossypium arboreum L.)-wheat, desi cotton-Indian mustard [Brassica juncea (L.) Czernj. & Cosson], desi cotton-sugarbeet (Beta vulgaris L.) and groundnut (Arachis hypogaea 1.,)-wheat. The highest seed-cotton yield of 2.18 tonnes/ha was obtained from desi cotton with 4 irrigations in desi cotton-sugarbeet and the highest wheat grain yield of 4.45 tonnes/ha with 5 irrigations in groundnut-wheat cropping system. Desi cotton-sugarbeet cropping system gave the highest wheat-equivalent yield (12.47 tonnes/ha) and monetary net return (Rs 37 248/ha/year) with 11 irrigations, followed by upland cotton-wheat (12.22 tonnes/ha/year and Rs 35 424/ha/year) with same number of irrigations. However, per irrigation highest wheat-equivalent yield (1.63 tonnes/ha/year) and net return (Rs 3 916/ha/year) were recorded under desi cotton-Indian mustard, followed by desi cotton-sugarbeet and upland cotton-wheat. The mean values of wheat-equivalent yield (11.13 and 10.90 tonnes/ha/year) and net return (Rs 3 1 051 and Rs 29 426/ha/year) recorded respectively under desi cotton-sugarbeet and upland cotton-wheat were at par and significantly superior to all other cropping systems. However, the highest mean benefit : cost ratio of 1.97 was recorded under groundnut-wheat followed by upland cotton-wheat (1.74). The highest mean sustainability yield and value indices of 0.77 and 0.84 were recorded under groundnut-wheat. followed by desi cotton-sugarbeet (0.65 and 0.49) and desi cotton-Indian mustard (0.57 and 0.48). The highest consumptive water use (941 mm) and land-utilization efficiency (92.05%) were recorded with desi cotton-sugarbeet. followed by upland cotton-wheat (912 mm and 86.85%). Maximum water-use efficiency, (13.91 kg/ha-mm) and production efficiency (34.40 kg/ha/day) were recorded in upland cotton-wheat. followed by desi cotton-sugarbeet (13.39 kg/ha-mm and 33.12 kg/ha/day).

AB A,field experiment was conducted during the winter season of 1997-98 and 1998-99 at Sagar, Madhya Pradesh, on clay soils, to find out the most suitable variety and, economical nitrogen dose for sustainable grain yield and economics of, lineseed (Linum usitatissimum L.) under rained condition. The field trial was laid out in split-plot design comprising 5 Varieties, ['SLS 21', 'SLS 9', 'SLS 7", 'RLC.29' ('Sheetal') and 'T 397] as main and 4 nitrogen levels (30, 40, 50 and 60.kg/ha) in subtreatment plots, replicated thrice. 'RLC 29' ('Sheetal') recorded significantly higher values of almost all the growth and yield parameters, grain. yield (q/ha) and economics over other varieties except plant height (cm), seeds/ capsule and harvest index (%) in pooled data, Though higher dose of 60 kg N/ha, produced significantly higher growth as well as sink parameters, 1,000-seed weight (g), grain yield (q/ha) and economics revealed possibility of saving 10 kg N/ha. Interaction study, however, showed that different growth and sink parameters were influenced significantly by N levels irrespective of varieties, but 'RLC 29' revealed higher both growth and yield attributes including grain yield, which gave good economics and proved most economical variety for late planting, especially after soybean and gave 57.51, 11.69, 14.44 and 22.53% more grain yield than 'SLS 21', 'SLS 9', 'SLS 7' and 'T 397' respectively. Further, 9.03 and 27.07% more grain yield was noted with 50 kg N/ha over 40 and 30 kg N/ha respectively.

AB The purpose of this paper is to provide some lessons for policy makers who are involved in implementing TVET projects in the developing world. It presents the findings of a study of 19 projects which were implemented in Jamaica, and in The Gambia, over the 1950 to 1996 period. A case study method was adopted, involving semi-structured interviews with key officials in each country and the collection of appropriate policy documents. The study was specifically concerned with identifying the role played by overseas aid agencies and the corresponding impact of depending on foreign consultants and project components obtained from the developed world. Overall, it found that this dependence could have a negative impact, both on a project's implementation and on its long term sustainability. Furthermore, the study illustrates how different types of dependency manifest themselves at various stages in the life cycle of TVET projects funded by overseas aid agencies. The paper concludes by suggesting steps that might be taken to reduce the likelihood of dependency being an influential factor in the implementation of future TVET projects.

AB Education and science have both been hailed as keys to development and 'progress' in the 20th century, which implies that science education in particular will open doors to such outcomes. However, the internationalisation of scientific work and the transnational science and technology industry may ensure that few benefits are experienced by a poor country. The innovative approaches of one institution in the education of scientists in Namibia is examined. It shows the possibilities of context-based science education to produce scientists capable of practical problem-solving, and the value of scientific partnership-building for sustainable development. This raises issues about the broader conceptual framework linking education, science and development. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All tights reserved.

AB A sustainable community-based arsenic mitigation pilot project has been successfully operating for 22 months in the Chapainawabganj arsenic hot spot (Bangladesh) where safe treated drinking and cooking water derived from tubewells is being supplied below the Bangladesh maximum permissible limit (0.05 ppm total arsenic). There has been close community involvement in all stages and the arsenic removal mechanism used adapted from the simple process of adsorption by natural ferric oxyhydroxide. Supplemented ferric oxyhydroxide produces daily de-contaminated water batches until replaced at the end of the cycle. A regional renewal/recycling centre supplies new, and safely stores used, ferric oxyhydroxide. Recycling is beginning where adsorbed arsenic can be separated prior to ferric oxyhydroxide reuse. The mechanism is flexible regarding water volumes, cycle lengths, pre and post-treatment arsenic concentrations, tubewell chemistries and is cost-effective. Pilot project parameters were set at 601 per day ( <0.05 ppm total arsenic) and 16 day cycles per tank for each of the four selected families with pretreatment concentrations up to 1.1 ppm. A maximum of <similar to>24 g of arsenic is produced from the similar to 900 g (dry) of ferric oxyhydroxide used per tank per year. Anecdotal evidence possibly suggests positive health effects within a few months and villagers report an improved water taste. The project should contribute to coping with such arsenicosis crises and expansion is planned.

AB Hydrogen is seen as one of the important energy vectors of the next century. Hydrogen as an energy carrier, provides the potential for a sustainable development particularly in the transportation sector. A hydrogen fueled engine has the potential for substantially cleaner emissions than other internal combustion engines. Other benefits arise from the wide flammability limits and the high flame propagation speed, both allowing better efficiency. The Laboratory of Transporttechnology (University of Gent) converted a GM/Crusader V8 SI engine for hydrogen use, to be built in a city bus. A sequential timed multipoint injection system was implemented. Attention is directed towards special characteristics related to the use of hydrogen as a fuel in IC engines: ignition properties (smaller spark plug gap), injection pressure (dependent on the means of storage: compressed gas or liquid), quality of the lubricating oil (due to higher blow-by volumes, a substantial amount of hydrogen is present in the crankcase), oxygen sensors (very lean operating conditions). The advantages and disadvantages of a power regulation by changing the air to fuel ratio (as for diesel engines), as compared to throttle regulation (SI engines) are judged.

   ecosystem damage; ecosystem health; land ethic
AB In order to use the planet's ecological life-support systems sustainably, damage to them must be both prevented and repaired. However, repair requires awareness of damage which, in this case, mandates a high level of ecological literacy. Prevention of ecological damage will only be successful on a planetary scale if human society endorses precautionary practices that reduce the probability of ecosystem damage. Society is beginning to endorse precautionary practices to protect human health, which is no longer regarded as merely absence of symptoms of disease and malfunction. Health is regarded as a robust function - an approach toward optimal conditions. Similar views are beginning to emerge regarding ecosystem health, and a close link between human and ecosystem health is gaining increased recognition. However, to achieve health, ecological 'wounds' must be repaired, which is impossible until society 'sees' the wounds. After this recognition, society must become more literate on the attributes of ecosystem health. The methods and procedures are in place, but they will not be used effectively until a major paradigm shift occurs.

ID SUSTAINABILITY DEBATE; ENTREPRENEURIAL CITY; COURSES; CITIES
AB The increase in the number of golf courses around the world has been phenomenal, particularly since the 1990s where an estimated 350 new courses were added annually to the more than 25 000 existing ones. In terms of recreational sports spaces, golf arguably uses the greatest amount of land. Using the case study of Singapore, it is argued that the continual expansion of golf courses runs counter to the broad ideal of urban sustainability. The arguments that support golf course expansion viz. reducing the issue to a matter of supply and demand and extolling golfs economic benefits pay scant attention to principles of equity and sustainability. Although existing green spaces risk being converted into golf courses, golf course maintenance itself can be ecologically benign. However, the elitist nature of golf in Singapore ultimately imposes greater and unnecessary demands on resources in general. Given Singapore's land scarcity, golf course expansion is opposed not so much because of its ecological impacts but because of how it compromises spatial equity.

AB This study contains a harvest model of water hyacinth which is applicable in natural waterways for nutrient removal at maximum sustainable yield (MSY). When the concentration of inorganic nitrogen in water (WA) (and the concentration of phosphorus in water (W-P) in the case of W-N < 0.164) is measured, MSY and the potential of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) removal from water by harvesting water hyacinth can be calculated from this model. The harvest biomass and nutrient removal are dependent on the concentration of nutrient in the water and the farming surface area. In this case study of Bangkok, Thailand, the potential for nitrogen and phosphor-us removal is compared between input and output of nutrient in the natural water-ways. The potential in the current condition reaches rates of 1.25% and 0.006%, respectively, while the potential of expected application in the future reaches rates of 1.45% and 0.007%, respectively.

ID MANAGEMENT
AB Water crises have occurred in more than 400 cities in China at the beginning of 2000. Investigation and statistical data suggest that there are five main problems in the management and utilization of water resources in China. These are (1) insufficient capacity and inhomogeneous space-time distribution of natural resources, (2) outdated construction of water conservancy projects and supply engineering, (3) unreasonable industrial water consumption, (4) increased water pollution and (5) incomplete management of the river basin and waterworks in city. It is necessary to take steps corresponding to the above-mentioned reasons to mitigate and even dispel the pressure on water resources for sustainable development of China as quickly as possible.

DE India; joint forest management; sustainability; community organizations;
   federation
AB Central to the debate on sustainability of joint forest management (JFM) initiatives in India, lie strategies to strengthen the existing institutional set up. An important aspect of this debate has been consolidation of community organizations at various levels. While the local village organizations form the bedrock of JFM initiatives at the micro level, at the regional level, over the years, the concept of federal bodies of village organizations with diversity of structures and functions has been a very important phenomenon taking place in several states of the country. Taking the case of JFM in Haryana, this study explores the various aspects of formation of federation of village level organizations in JFM, known as Hill Resource Management Societies (HRMS). Based on the findings, it elaborates some of the operational issues which need to be taken into consideration before developing the federation. It concludes that such a set up would not only augment the synergistic and productive relationships with respect to resource management and conservation but also enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the JFM programme in Haryana.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID RESOURCES
AB The problem of achieving sustainable groundwater management in areas of over-exploitation is examined by using the zipper Guadiana basin in central Spain as an example. Here, since the early 1970s, high rates of abstraction to provide water for irrigation have lowered the water table by up to 50 in, causing the main rivers to run dry and an internationally renowned wetland to become desiccated. Conflict between farmers, regulators and conservationists has created a difficult problem that legal action, subsidies and engineering solutions have so far failed to combat. Faced with conflicting demands, it is suggested that integrated catchment management provides the best way forward. The various issues that need to be addressed with this type of management system are outlined.

AB Based on the data of SO2 emission, urban air quality, and acid precipitation, the status and characteristics of acid rain and SO2 pollution in China were analyzed. To prevent the further deterioration of acid rain and SO, pollution effectively, the Acid Rain Control Zones and SO2 Pollution Control Zones (Two Control Zones called for short) were designated. The range of Two Control Zones was 1.09 x 10(6) km(2), 11.4% of the whole territory of China, with SO2 emissions of 14 million tons in 1995. The Acid Rain Control Zone involves 14 provinces, autonomous regions or municipalities, with total area of 0.806 x 10(6) km(2). The SO2 Pollution Control Zone includes 63 cities with total area of 0.29 x 10(6) km(2). The control policies to be implemented in the Two Control Zones were formulated by the method of life cycle analysis on sulfur-in-coal. The impacts of the policy implementation on energy industry, including coal industry and power industry, were calculated and analyzed. It was proved that the policy implementation would improve the thermal power mix and promote the sustainable development of energy industry. The paper also analyzed the decrease of SO2 emission and the improvement of air quality in the cities in recent years, which were achieved by the control efforts.

AB Due to environmental constraints and reactive water management practices, water shortages exist across the Everglades ecosystem. A growing human population and continued wetlands damage and loss decrease the system's ability to provide water for sustained natural areas and for human uses. 'The Restudy' is an $8 billion plan to restore the Everglades while also continuing to provide water storage for urban and agricultural areas. The Restudy proposes a mix of water storage systems to provide for the predicted future growth in water demand. This mix is purported to be the most cost-efficient at providing water supplies, within the constraints of unchanged agricultural and urban land use. However, a sensitivity analysis of the Restudy's cost equation reveals that the total cost of water storage systems is influenced by real estate, land acquisition and water treatment costs. The interaction of land use and agricultural policies can affect these cost factors, and can change the relative cost-efficiency between storage systems. Real estate and land acquisition costs are affected by several 1996 Farm Bill provisions, which influence the cost of aboveground water storage systems versus Aquifer Storage and Recovery systems. The Governor's Commission for a Sustainable South Florida recommendations also influence the water storage options available to the Restudy. Due to the Restudy's initial assumptions and constraints, it may not advocate the most economically and ecologically sound remediation. (C) 2001 Academic Press.

AB Current vegetable production systems use polyethylene (plastic) mulch and require multiple applications of agrochemicals. During rain events, runoff from vegetable production is enhanced because 50 to 75% of the field is covered with an impervious surface. This study was conducted to quantify off-site movement of soil and pesticides with runoff from tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) plots containing polyethylene mulch and a vegetative mulch, hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth). Side-by-side field plots were instrumented with automated flow meters and samplers to measure and collect runoff, which was filtered, extracted, and analyzed to determine soil and pesticide loss. Seasonal losses of two to four times more water and at least three times as much sediment were observed from plots with polyethylene mulch (55.4 to 146 L m(-2) and 247 to 535 g m(-2), respectively) versus plots with hairy vetch residue (13.7 to 75.7 L m(-2) and 32.8 to 118 g m(-2), respectively). Geometric means (+/- standard deviation) of total pesticide loads for chlorothalonil (tetrachloroisophthalonitrile) and alpha- and beta-endosulfan (6,7,8,9,10,10-liexachloro-1,5,5a,6,9,9a-hexahydro-6,9-methano-2,4,3-benzodioxathiepin 3-oxide) for a runoff event ere 19, 6, and 9 times greater from polyethylene (800 +/- 4.6, 17.6 +/- 3.9, and 39.1 +/- 4.9 mug m(-2), respectively) than from hairy vetch mulch plots (42 +/- 6.0, 2.8 +/- 5.0, and 4.3 +/- 4.6 mug m(-2), respectively) due to greater concentrations and larger runoff volumes. The increased runoff volume, soil loss, and off-site loading of pesticides measured in runoff from the polyethylene mulch suggests that this management practice is less sustainable and may have a harmful effect on the environment.

AB Inorganic copper is used as a broad-spectrum fungicide and bacteriocide on a variety of agricultural crops. After application, the copper residue typically accumulates in the upper 15 cm of soil. Data from the California Pesticide Use Reports were used to estimate the augmentation of copper in the soil that resulted from pesticide applications for the six years from 1993 to 1998 on 12 crops that are grown without rotation. The estimated mean mg Cu kg(-1) soil added to the upper 15 cm during the six years was the following: walnut (Juglans regia L.), 28; peach [Prunus persica (L.) Batsch var. persica], 22; nectarine [Prunus persica (L.) Batsch var. nucipersica (Suckow) C.K. Schneid], 19; cherry (Pseudolmedia oxypkyllaria Donn. Sm.), 18; rice (Oryza sativa L.), 16; apricot (Prunus armeniaca L.), 11; orange [Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck] and plum (Prunus domestica L. subsp. domestica), 9; lemon [Citrus limon (L.) Burm. f.] and almond [Prunus dulcis (Mill.) D.A. Webb], 6; pear (Pyrus communis L.), 4; and grape (Vitis vinifera L.), 3. In addition, for the first rise of these crops, we estimated the area that was treated with each level of kg Cu ha(-1). For example, for walnut orchards, we estimated that 12 500 ha, or 17% of the planted area, was treated with a quantity of Cu that would increase the total concentration of Cu in the upper 15 cm of soil by at least 50 mg Cu kg(-1) soil. A comparison of the amount of Cu per unit planted area that was applied in the first and second half of the study indicated that the intensity of copper use is either relatively constant or increasing, depending on the crop. The findings are discussed in relation to the potential effect of continued long-term use of Cu pesticides on soil sustainability.

AB There is a limit to the performance of an organism set by energy intake and energy mobilization. Here, the focus is on humans with unlimited access to food and for whom physical activity can be limited by energy mobilization. The physical activity level (PAL) in the general population, calculated as doubly-labelled-water-assessed average daily metabolic rate as a multiple of basal metabolic rate, has an upper limit of 2.2-2.5. The upper limit of sustainable metabolic rate is approximately twice as high in endurance athletes, mainly because of longterm exercise training with simultaneous consumption of carbohydrate-rich food during exercise. Endurance athletes have an increased fat-free mass and can maintain energy balance at a PAL value of 4.0-5.0. High altitude limits exercise performance as a result of combined effects on nutrient supply and the capacity to process nutrients. Thus, trained subjects climbing Mount Everest reached PAL values of 2.0-2.7, well below the observed upper limit at sea level.

AB This paper proposes a mechanism responsible for setting the sustainable level of muscle performance. Our contentions are that the sustainable work rate is determined (i) at the muscle level, (ii) by the ability to maintain ATP supply and (iii) by the products of glycolysis that may inhibit the signal for oxidative phosphorylation. We argue below that no single factor 'limits' sustainable performance, but rather that the flux through and the interaction between glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation set the level of sustainable ATP supply. This argument is based on magnetic resonance spectroscopy measurements of the sources and sinks for energy in vivo in human muscle and rattlesnake tailshaker muscle during sustained contractions. These measurements show that glycolysis provides between 20 % (human muscle) and 40 % (tailshaker muscle) of the ATP supply during sustained contractions in these muscles. We cite evidence showing that this high glycolytic flux does not reflect an O-2 limitation or mitochondria operating at their capacity. Instead, this flux reflects a pathway independent of oxidative phosphorylation for ATP supply during aerobic exercise. The consequence of this high glycolytic flux is accumulation of H+, which we argue inhibits the rise in the signal activating oxidative phosphorylation, thereby restricting oxidative ATP supply to below the oxidative capacity. Thus, both glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation play important roles in setting the highest steady-state ATP synthesis flux and thereby determine the sustainable level of work by exercising muscle.

ID HOUSING INSURANCE; COMPETITION
AB In a housing insurance market buildings have different damage probabilities. High-risk houses need investment, low-risk houses don't. Insurers use imperfect tests to assess risks. The market is a natural monopoly: with more than one active insurer, high-risk house owners continue to apply to insurers until they are eventually assigned to the low-risk class. The natural monopoly need not be sustainable. In equilibrium the incumbent accommodates entry even when the natural monopoly is sustainable. We explain recent observations from Germany and Switzerland where damage rates and prices went up drastically after the transition from state monopolies to competitive environments.

   ORGANIZATIONS; CAPABILITIES; TECHNOLOGY; THINKING
AB With the emergence of the resource-based view of the firm and of the concept of core competencies, intangible resources, and tacit knowledge in particular have been argued to occupy a central place in the development of sustainable competitive advantage. This is because tacit knowledge is argued to be difficult to imitate, to substitute, to transfer and it is rare. However. there is little empirical research to support this theoretical proposition. Tacit knowledge has so far resisted operationalization. This paper sets out to define the term tacit knowledge and proposes to redefine it, within the context of the resource-based view of the firm, as tacit skills. A methodology (based on causal mappings self-Q and storytelling) for empirically researching the subject is outlined.

TI Evaluating success in urban freeway planning
SO JOURNAL OF PLANNING EDUCATION AND RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB There are clear benefits to the urban freeway mode of transportation, including increased mobility and accessibility. Historically, however, they have often brought adverse impacts to the communities that they traverse. There are signs that the 1990s generation of urban freeways has been more environmentally sensitive to neighborhoods. This study tests success in urban transportation planning by evaluating the impacts of the Squaw Peak Parkway in Phoenix, Arizona. Strategies within four thematic areas characterizing urban freeway planning are examined to explain success. The household survey in adjacent neighborhoods suggests that most freeway impacts were successfully mitigated. The article concludes that important lessons were learned from the earlier decades of freeway building. At the same time, broader issues surrounding more sustainable forms of transportation were not explored, and the authors speculate that success was obtained at the project level but question the freeway's success at the larger urban policy level.

AB At the dawn of the Information Age, the competitive dynamics in numerous industries are more intense than ever before. We look at the implications of competitive dynamics to IT strategies. We summarize the basic logic of various well-known (IT) strategy methods, particularly regarding sustainability of an advantage and conclude that (IT) strategy theory incorporates precious little about competitive dynamics. We then explore a recent strategy framework, Sustainability Analysis [Calif. Mgmt Rev. 34 (1992) 29; Strategy and the Search for Rents: The Evolution of Diversity among Firms, 1994; Renewable Advantage, 1998]. Sustainability Analysis distinguishes three 'ecologies' that entail important differences in strategies and timelines for sustaining (IT) advantage. We review these ecologies and draw insights for IT strategy. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective To investigate the fat-reduction strategies used by a group of older adults who successfully made and maintained positive dietary changes for 5 years or longer.
   Design Participants completed 2 copies of a self-administered food frequency questionnaire: The first copy assessed diet before they began making changes and the second copy assessed diet after initiation of healthful dietary changes. Positive food changes were identified from the food frequency questionnaires. During in-person interviews, participants placed food changes onto a time line according to the nearest estimated date of initiation of the change.
   Subjects Participants were 65 free-living older adults (aged > 50 years) who had maintained substantial changes to decrease fat intake in their diet for at, least 5 years.
   Statistical analyses performed Quantitative and qualitative data were used to identify the fat-reduction strategies acid to confirm and validate the fat-reduction strategy model. Confirmatory factor analysis was performed to confirm the new model. The Kuder-Richardson-20 reliability coefficient (kr) was used to determine internal consistency of the scales developed for the study.
   Results The majority of participants decreased their fat intake gradually, at different time points in their lives, and over a long period of tune (5 to 43 years). Mean percent energy intake from fat decreased from 44.3 +/- 5.9% before dietary improvement to 25.9 +/- 7.1% at the time of the study. The final model consisted of 5 fat-reduction strategies with 63 food changes. The strategies were: increase summer fruits (4 items; kr=0.66), increase vegetables and grains (14 items; kr=0.79), decrease recreational foods (14 items; kr=0.76), decrease cooking fat (20 items; kr=0.86), and use fat-modified foods (11 items; kr=0.80).
   Applications/conclusions Dietetics professionals should base their advice on the dietary strategies used by consumers rather than hypothetical premises such as food or nutrient groupings. Nutrition education interventions will have better chances for success if they are based on a set of customized programs that guide appropriate consumer segments through a series of small, comfortable. and sustainable dietary changes over a prolonged period of time.

   treatment
AB During the treatment of wastewater, sewage sludge is produced, the long-term utilisation of which must be guaranteed according to national regulations and laws. Thus, one central objective are cost-effective and sustainable sludge treatment methods. A relatively new method is the humification or mineralisation of sewage sludge in reed beds. Initial experiences with this method were made in the 60s. In spite of increasing interest, there are neither acknowledged technological rules nor national directives in Germany. According to today's state of knowledge, the treatment of stabilised sewage sludge in reed beds can be realised with all sludge qualities. In this paper mass balance of dry solids and water and the behaviour of heavy metals and AOX will presented. Also the reload of the WTTP will be discussed.

AB This study considers air pollution total quantity control and land use management to establish a methodology for estimating unit emission loads of land use types. An air pollution evaluation system (APES) is developed, based on air pollution evaluation theory and procedure by linking air pollution total quantity control and land use management. The APES consists of an information management subsystem, a model management subsystem, and an evaluation subsystem. The Nankan urban area, located in northern Taiwan, is used to illustrate the capability of the APES. The analysis results indicate that the integration of GIS technology, a spreadsheet application, and an air pollution simulation model into APES has made it an effective system for facilitating the examination of a set of alternatives and generating a sustainable land use management strategy.

AB Purpose: Prenatal detection of obstructive uropathy is used widely and vesicoamniotic shunting is the accepted procedure in well-defined cases. We present outcomes of vesicoamniotic shunting in a consecutive series from a coordinated prenatal-postnatal treatment program.
   Materials and Methods: From 1989 to 1998 bladder obstruction was identified in 89 fetuses at a multidisciplinary prenatal high risk clinic. Prenatal intervention was considered in cases of bilateral hydronephrosis associated with evidence of bladder outlet obstruction and oligohydramnios.
   Results: Indications for prenatal shunting were present in 12 patients (13%), and 9 underwent vesicoamniotic shunt insertion between weeks 20 and 28 of gestation. None of the prenatal procedures was associated with preterm labor, chorioamnionitis or urine chemistry values greater than cutoff threshold on bladder tap. Shunts were extruded from 2 fetuses, which required sequential insertion. After prenatal intervention I patient elected pregnancy termination and the others proceeded to term. Two neonates died at birth, and 6 survived. The underlying urological diagnosis was posterior urethral valves in 4 newborns, urethral atresia in 1, and prune belly variant and urethral atresia in 1. Of the patients 3 had relatively normal renal function, 2 had severe renal insufficiency and 1 had mild renal impairment. Five newborns are voiding freely and 1 underwent bladder reconstruction and is on intermittent catheterization. None of the patients had pulmonary problems at last followup.
   Conclusions: Although vesicoamniotic shunting is effective in reversing oligohydramnios, its ability to achieve sustainable good renal function in infancy is variable. No specific prenatal parameters were effective in predicting eventual good renal function. Pulmonary function cannot be assured with restoration of amniotic fluid.

AB Kenya's development seems trapped in a vicious circle caused by soil erosion, declining soil fertility, land fragmentation, fluctuating agricultural production, widespread poverty, corruption, ethnic tension, rapid population. urban growth and a declining economy, The development challenge is to reverse the negative effects of these processes and promote sustainable development. This paper, based on multidisciplinary work discusses whether sustainable development based on agriculture is attainable in Murang'a district in Kenya's Central Highlands. Firstly, it investigates some biophysical aspects of sustainable agriculture such as land use across time, soil nutrient status and yield, cultivated crops and soil productivity by analysing aerial photographs and soil samples and conducting interviews. It suggests that the area has gone through major biophysical changes. Second. it relates the farmers' attitude to promotion of sustainable development as carried out by the National Soil and Water Conservation Programme. It suggests that farmers carry ideas of corruption, often following ethnic lines that hampers efficient implementation of the extension advise. Finally, it identifies links behind rural-urban migration by estimating households' probability of generating incomes outside the farm, typically in urban areas. Opportunistic farming, manifested by temporary reduction of farming on own land to satisfy immediate income needs, is very common among farmers.
   More needs to be done to promote agro-based, small-scale rural industries, improve agricultural management practices, facilitate appropriate credits, enhance marketing opportunities. ensure timely crop payments, and increase participation in decision making. It is important to realize that for farmers to embrace policies which promote agriculturely-based sustainable development the policies ought to biophysically possible, socio-politically acceptable and economically feasible.

TI The experience of self-care groups with people affected by leprosy:
   ALERT, Ethiopia
SO LEPROSY REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
ID FOOT
AB This paper describes the development of self-care groups in Ethiopia by ALERT, and the successes and failures experienced in the process. The groups were started in 1995 in response to two main problems, the increasing number of people dependent on ALERT to heal their wounds despite years of health education, and the limited financial resources of ALERT for wound healing supplies. By December 1999, there were a total of 72 established groups. Group membership was voluntary. There have been a number of positive outcomes. Group members have taken up responsibility for managing and monitoring their own wounds and supplying their own wound healing materials. More attention is paid to their personal hygiene and personal appearance. They also report increased confidence to participate in society, retored dignity and self-respect, and a sense of belonging within the community. In addition, some members have started to pay more attention to their local environmental hygiene by building pit latrines and waste disposal sites. The ALERT staff involved in this initiative had to change their role from that of a leprosy service provider to a self-care group facilitator, but not all were successful in making this transition. The remaining challenge for the programme is sustainability and further development through the National Tuberculosis and Leprosy Control Programme, The Ethiopian National Association for Ex-Leprosy Patients and possibly other organizations too.

TI When regulation fails: vendace fishery in the Gulf of Bothnia
SO MARINE POLICY
LA English
DT Article
DE bleak-roe fishing; common-pool resources; resilience; co-management
AB The fishing of vendace (Coregonus albula), in the Gulf of Bothnia, is a good illustration of the presumption that institutional arrangements that are too inflexible to cope with changing ecological conditions, are unlikely to prosper. Although the vendace fishing is regulated by the State, catches have decreased dramatically, and there is a considerable fear that the resource is about to be depleted. This article discusses how the present institutional arrangement affects collective action and why political solutions seem to have failed. The vendace case illustrates that even a rather limited resource concentrated in a limited area is unlikely to be sustainably managed by top-down regulation performed by the State. It is concluded that changes in management practices that are obvious from the perspective of ecosystem management might turn out to be unfeasible, given the multi-stakeholder character of the, gi management system. From this article it can also be concluded that resilience theory and experiences from long-enduring CPRs correspond very well with each other. Finally, it is discussed whether it is meaningful to talk about institutional, or managerial, resilience uncoupled from the ecosystem it is supposed to be managed. If an ecosystem, like the vendace, that is subject to human activity loses its resilience this would automatically indicate the socio-economic system, as manifested in management practices, has already lost its ability to adapt. Thus, social and ecological resilience are communicating vessels but not perhaps as the concept might be understood according to a popular call for increased institutional resilience in natural resource management.

AB An approach to poverty reduction in low-income countries known as the 'sustainable livelihoods approach' is applied to understanding the strategies of artisanal fisherfolk confronted by fluctuating fisheries resources. The livelihood approach is explained, and the insights it provides into conventional fisheries management policies in developing countries are explored. It is argued that both state-led management and some of the newer, community or territorial use-rights approaches, if predicated on an incomplete understanding of livelihoods, can result in management directives incompatible with both resource conservation and the social and economic goals of management.

AB Toxicogenetics, toxicogenomics and proteomics are providing new biomarkers for use in human studies. These, coupled with the more traditional biological responses currently in use, provide a vast armamentarium for assessing exposures, effects and susceptibility factors relating to environmental pollutants. Biomarker availability, however, does not automatically translate to usefulness for studies directed at human health improvement. Transitional studies bridging the gap between laboratory and field, with the biomarker as dependent variable, are required for validation for intended applications. Prospective or cross-sectional studies are usually optimal for validating biomarkers of exposure, where the biomarker response follows the event (exposure) and the entire study population is affected. Biomarkers of effect, where the event (outcome) follows the biomarker response and may be infrequent in the study population, present more complex problems. Identification of genotypes as susceptibility factors requires that additional issues be addressed. Despite these difficulties, new data are emerging from transitional investigations that are providing validated biomarkers for sustainable human studies. It is now possible to envision schemes for integrating the results of molecular epidemiological investigations into the general toxicological evaluations of environmental agents. These will allow intermediate endpoints to be used for making realistic human health assessments and for elucidating pathogenic mechanisms that identify targets for intervention, all with the goal of preventing environmentally mediated human disease. Finally, select biomarker responses that predict the likelihood of disease occurrence will find application in the interpretation of individual medical diagnostic tests, with the goal of improving cancer detection and management.

   Southern African Region: Evolution and context
SO NATURAL RESOURCES JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB Water resources management is receiving increased attention worldwide due to the growing realization that most areas of the world face major challenges with regard to the quantitative and qualitative aspects of water. These challenges are attributed to a multitude of factors, the most important of which are the significant increase in population, urbanization, and environmental degradation. Such factors are more apparent in the Southern African Region than in many other parts of the world. The region is, by and large, and and semi-arid and as a result faces a shortage of water in many areas. Moreover, the high rates of population growth and urbanization threaten to worsen the situation. The region depends, to a large extent, on the waters of river basins, most of which are shared by two or more countries. Under these circumstances, the potential for conflicts over shared water resources exists and is expanding. Thus, the recent conclusion of the Revised Protocol on Shared Watercourses in the Southern African Development Community is a significant step towards averting such conflicts and developing close cooperation for a sustainable, coordinated, and equitable utilization of Southern Africa's shared watercourses. This article examines the water resource problems of the Southern African Development Community Region and discusses and analyzes the Revised Protocol. The article compares the main provisions of the Revised Protocol with an earlier protocol and with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Non-Navigational Uses of International Watercourses.

AB This article described an action-research pilot project to provide opportunities for the remote Kelabit community in the Malaysian state of Sarawak, on the island of Borneo, to use information and communication technologies (ICTS) for sustainable human development. The project aims to establish a telecentre as a place for the community to use ICTs. Although many in the community have heard about computers, they have not seen or used them. In Phase I of this project, a team of University Malaysia Sarawak (UNIMAS) researchers were involved in the collection of base-line data to provide a socio-economic profile of the community; to establish existing pattern., of communication and computer awareness and finally to determine the current attitudes towards computers in Bario's secondary school (SMK Bario). Findings indicate that due to Bario's relative isolation, community members cited their relatives to be the main source of information and face-to-face communication as the major channel of communication, and that a majority of school teachers had a positive attitude towards using ICTs. Recommendations for future directions in promoting the utilization of ICTs to lead to the establishment of a telecentre are discussed.

TI Global public goods: What role for civil society?

DT Article
AB This article draws attention to the importance of public goods for the well-being of people, including, as a means toward this end,for the efficiency of markets. The author suggests that as a result of globalization, a growing number of public goods have assumed cross-border dimensions and become global public goods (GPGs). They can no longer be adequately provided through domestic policy action alone but require international cooperation for their adequate provision. The author argues that for globalization to work for all, it is important for civil society organizations (CSOs) to become more systematically involved in international negotiations and cooperation and to facilitate closer linkages between domestic policy making and international cooperation. Six policy options are discussed that could strengthen the role of CSOs in the provision of GPGs and in achieving more balanced and sustainable development.

AB Spherical tokamaks, because of their blender central columns, have very limited volt second capability relative to that of standard aspect ratio tokamaks of similar plasma cross-section. Recent experiments on NSTX have begun to quantify and optimize the ohmic current drive efficiency in an MA class ST device. Sustainable ramp rates in excess of 5 MA/s during the current rise phase have been achieved on NSTX, while faster ramps generate significant MHD activity. Discharges with I-p exceeding 1 MA have been achieved in NSTX with nominal parameters: aspect ratio A = 1.3 1.4, elongation kappa = 2-2.2, triangularity delta = 0.4, internal inductance l(i) = 0.6, Ejima coefficient C-E = 0.35. Flux consumption efficiency results, performance improvements associated with first boronization and comparisons with neoclassical resistivity are described.

AB Several researchers have hypothesized that, through various mechanisms, loss of species and functional group richness from a plant community will affect the magnitude and interannual variability of productivity. To test this hypothesis, I conducted a microcosm study of California grassland communities that differed in species richness. I grew cohorts of microcosms that simulated undisturbed grassland (in one year) and gopher-disturbed grassland (in two consecutive years). As the number of species per functional group decreased from 4 to 1, biomass production remained constant in all three cohorts. As species richness decreased from 16 to 1 (or 8 to 1, in either case including a drop in functional group richness), productivity declined in one of the cohorts. In this cohort, productivity of one polyculture marginally exceeded that of the most productive monoculture. Resource complementarity and a type of selection effect may have each contributed to the observed diversity-productivity relationships. Results suggest the existence of a selection effect that involves species that are highly productive in mixtures, rather than in monoculture. Over two seasons, species and functional group richness did not affect the interannual variability of biomass production, Comparisons of interannual changes in the productivity of monocultures and polycultures suggested that, in some polycultures, increased water availability might have relieved interspecific competition more than intraspecific competition. Based on results from this experiment and other manipulative experiments, I develop a framework to explain the relationship between species richness and productivity in terrestrial plant communities, The framework highlights the importance of environmental variation in shaping the diversity/productivity relationship.

TI Drilling the limit (TM) - Experiences with a new method for designing
   and drilling wells
SO OIL GAS-EUROPEAN MAGAZINE
LA English
DT Article
AB At the beginning of 2000, a pilot project was initiated at BEB based on the Drilling the Limit (TM) method developed by Shell. The purpose of this project is to apply the DTL method to the design and execution of two wells and thus demonstrate and realize the savings potential presented by this process. Its aim is not only the reduction of drilling costs per meter ("less cost per foot"), but also the sustainable reduction of the Unit Technical Costs (UTC) over the entire life of the well.
   Drilling the Limit (TM) is not a technology but rather a culture as well as a method for the design and execution of wells, and it focuses on people and processes. The essential elements and characteristics of the method are introduced. An account is given of experience gained during the conceptual and detailed design of the pilot project as well as of the execution of the two wells.
   During the conceptual design of the wells it was shown that it is worthwhile to engage additional personnel for a customized well design instead of a standard "off-the-shelf" solution. The detailed planning of the drilling of the well in cooperation with all of those who Will later participate in its execution likewise enables a significant reduction in drilling time and high design quality. In addition, Performance Coaching was introduced during the execution phase. It comprises the implementation of a Continuous Improvement Process (CIP) with the so-called "Plan-Execute-Measure-Learn-Cycle" into the processes surrounding the drilling of a well.
   The introduction of DTL implies a drastic change process that puts previous approaches to the design and execution of wells to the test. As a whole it has enabled the realization of a significant savings potential. Based on positive past experience, BEB will continue its application of the DTL method.

TI Using Aldo Leopold's land ethic to read environmental history - The case
   of the Keweenaw forest
SO ORGANIZATION & ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Aldo Leopold's notion of a land ethic provides a useful conceptual framework for interpreting environmental histories, which in turn maybe used to plan more effective land use policies for the future. In this article, the authors use a Leopoldian framework as a heuristic device to interpret the environmental history of the land in one small place-the Keweenaw Peninsula of northern Michigan-where successive human purposes altered the landscape dramatically over time. This article identifies the historical roles that power relations and the land ethic have played in land use and land health. The article concludes by identifying the need for community action based in a land ethic to maintain a healthy forest through sustainable use. Although it is unlikely the Keweenaw forest will return to its preindustrial state, the community can aim for a forest that exemplifies Leopold's qualities of integrity, stability productivity, and beauty.

TI SUVs and the greening of Ford - Reimagining industrial ecology as an
   environmental corporate strategy in action
SO ORGANIZATION & ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB The Ford Motor Company is a transnational automobile manufacturer and a contemporary cultural icon with immense and far-reaching effects on economy, ecology, and society. As it has been throughout its history, Ford today is often in the public spotlight. Its recent move toward more ecological and sustainable practices, one of the more remarkable developments in business management in decades, has begun to remake Ford's image. As this cultural critique shows, however the continued production of SUVs, a highly profitable but possibly anti-ecological pursuit, is not the only contradiction in Ford's quest to reinvent itself as a green business leader Its core belief (that the world can and should accommodate the desires of mobile consumers, most of whom are both auto enthusiasts and environmentalists) serves as a severely limiting condition. Ford's innovations are noteworthy, but its approach falls short of what is needed from big business to help create a more ecological society.

AB Natural ecosystems can offer attractive models for sustainable crop production, but hitherto only relatively complex vegetation has been considered. This review focuses on simple vegetation with a single dominant species. There are many reports of wild relatives of rice, sorghum and wheat in simple, extensive, often annual and apparently stable natural stands. These 'wild fields' could provide appropriate models for the ecologically sound management of cereal fields. The authors suggest that early farmers had a working knowledge of the ecology of wild cereal vegetation: this was important during cereal domestication and subsequently in crop management. There is a need for field research on monodominant wild cereal vegetation to confirm the value of simple natural models and to provide an ecological pedigree for the sustainable management of fields for food production.

TI Coffee: is it still a viable cash crop for smallholders in Africa?
SO OUTLOOK ON AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
ID MANAGEMENT; MALAWI
AB Smallholder coffee production in Africa has declined over the last 10 years due to a combination of unfavourable producer prices, inefficient marketing and the high cost of inputs resulting from economic structural adjustment policies and lack of credit facilities. Although there is currently a surplus of coffee on the world market and prices may remain low for some time as a result, the 'fair trade' sector is expanding, offering a marketing opportunity for smallholders. This article examines some of the problems currently facing the smallholder sector in Africa and suggests that adapting the principles of integrated crop management (ICM) to the needs of coffee smallholders can contribute to the profitability and sustainability of the sector.

AB An experiment was undertaken to study the effect of dietary carbohydrates with different digestibility on the populations of Oesophagostamum dentatum in the intestinal tract of pigs. Sixty-four worm-free pigs from a specific pathogen-free farm were randomly divided into 8 equal groups. The animals in 4 groups were assigned to a diet with partially undegradable carbohydrates (diet 1), while the pigs in the 4 remaining groups were given a diet with fermentable carbohydrates (diet 2). Diet 1 was comprised of barley flour, oat husk meal, soybean meal, vitamins and minerals and diet 2 of barley flour, inulin and sugar beet fibre, soybean meal, vitamins and minerals. The pigs in 6 of the groups (n=48) were inoculated with 6000 infective larvae of O. dentatum. To determine O. dentatum populations at the early stage of infection, 16 pigs were slaughtered 3 weeks p.i., while the remaining 4 groups continued on the diets for a further 9 weeks after which they were slaughtered. In a diet cross-over experiment 6 weeks after inoculation, 8 pigs changed from diet 1 to diet 2 (diet 1 > diet 2), and 8 pigs from diet 2 to diet 1 (diet 2 > diet 1). The results showed that partially undegradable carbohydrates provided favourable conditions not only for parasite establishment and sustainability, but also for already established O. dentatum infection while, in contrast, the diet composed of highly degradable carbohydrates decreased worm establishment, size and female fecundity. The implications for pastured pigs or pigs fed different complex carbohydrate diets is discussed.

AB This paper examines in detail two paths that lead to Structural Realism (SR), viz. a substantive philosophical position which asserts that only the structure of the world is knowable, The upward path is any attempt to begin with empiricist premises and reach a sustainable realist position. (It has been advocated by Russell, Weyl, and Maxwell among others.) The do it inward path is any attempt to start from realist premises and construct a weaker realist position. (It has been recently advocated by Worrall, French, and Ladyman.) This paper unravels and criticizes the metaphysical presuppositions of both paths to SR. It questions its very possibility as a substantive-and viable-realist thesis.

AB This paper relates changes in aggregate population, affluence (measured as GDP), and indicators for environmental pressures, the latter being based upon the socioeconomic metabolism concept, for Austria from 1830 to 1995. During this period of time Austria underwent a transition from a predominantly agricultural mode of substistence to an industrial economy. The Austrian population increased by a factor of 2.3, total GDP by a factor of 28.2 and per capita GDP by a factor of 12.2. Environmental indicators change by factors of between 0.85 and over 1000. In general we find that although efficiencies (environmental pressure per unit of GDP) increased dramatically, total environmental pressures increased considerably for most indicators, except for those that are related to an agricultural mode of subsistence. Our results indicate that environmental policies that aim to reduce the environmental pressure per unit of GDP (i.e., increase "ecological efficiency") are not likely to be sufficient for sustainable development because efficiency gains are more than compensated for by increases in affluence. instead, sustainability policy should focus on reducing total environmental pressures.

AB From a material and energetic perspective, this paper outlines the patterns of society-nature interactions of a local horticultural, hunter-and-gatherer population that lives on a remote island between India and Indonesia. Based on empirical research, we present several indicators to show an economic portfolio of a local society that combines horticulture, hunting and gathering activities with elements of industrialisation and market economy. In describing these environmental relations, the study narrows its focus to the use of three socio-ecological concepts, namely socio-economic metabolism, colonising natural processes, and the energetic return on investment. Using these concepts, we show the dynamics of social and environmental transformation at a local level and the consequences this may have for sustainability.

AB The method of material flows analysis has been used to reveal the characteristics of total material requirement, material consumption intensity, and material productivity in China from 1990 to 1996. The objectives of this study are to estimate the resource and environmental costs of China's accelerated economic growth and to evaluate sustainability in China. The results show that total material requirement, direct material input, and material consumption intensity in China increased steadily with socio-economic development. The principal contributors to total material requirement include mining and excavation for infrastructure, fossil fuels and their hidden flows, soil erosion, metals and their hidden flows, and industrial minerals and their hidden flows.

SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF CIVIL ENGINEERS-MUNICIPAL ENGINEER

AB Put together, local and central government spending on construction accounts for 40% of all construction in the UK, making the public sector the construction industry's single most important client group. Bearing in mind that a third of construction time and money is wasted in the construction process, cost-savings of ten percent could produce annual savings of more than pound1.5 billion for local authorities. Improving the value of the construction product is the premise behind Rethinking Construction. Its principles of partnership, respect for people and an emphasis on quality rather than lowest cost, dovetail with those of best value-a Government initiative to encourage local authorities to take account of whole-life costs, rather than cheapest initial costs. Rethinking Construction also supports local authority objectives such as regeneration, improving skills of local people and improving the quality and sustainability of the urban environment. With the help of the Local Government Task Force (LGTF) which champions Rethinking Construction at local government level, local authorities are increasingly adopting Rethinking Construction practices, evidenced in the increase in Movement for Innovation (M41) demonstration projects put forward by local authorities in recent months. To illustrate how Rethinking Construction principles work in action, the LGTF actively seeks projects that demonstrate some form of innovative approach to construction, whether they be new build, refurbishment, maintenance or repair. This is just the beginning. As the Audit Commission looks for evidence that local authorities are applying best value in their construction procurement processes, examples of Rethinking Construction in practice will become increasingly widespread within local government.

SO PROCESS SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION

ID NONSPHERICAL PARTICLES; MIXTURES
AB Obtaining energy from sustainable sources such as waste and biomass has required a significant extension of combustion technology. Many of the advanced technologies are based on thermal treatment in gas-solid packed-bed systems such as gasifiers, incinerators and biomass furnaces. In this paper channel formation in a packed bed of fuel solids as a result of the random packing process has been investigated. Channelling causes a severely uneven distribution of the primary airflow through a packed fuel bed and results in poor combustion performance of the furnace. By assuming Furnas packing, a general relationship is derived between the bed porosity and the particle size distribution and the proposed methodology is tested against limited experimental data. A probability density function (PDF) of truncated Gaussian type is assumed for the random size distribution at local areas within the bed and the local bed porosity is calculated accordingly. Then by solving the fluid flow equations through the porous bed, flow rate profiles are obtained at the top surface of the bed.
   Two particulate systems were investigated as a function of change in bed height and pressure drop through the grate. Depending on bed height and pressure drop through the grate, maximum local flow rate at the top surface of the bed can be 1.5 similar to 2 times higher than the minimum flow rate for the particulate system with a narrower size range (2.5 mm-18 mm) while the ratio of the maximum to minimum flow rate can reach as high as 8 similar to 32 for the particulate system with a wider size range (0.677 mm-20 mm). Visualization of the velocity profile inside the bed reveals that flow passages are slightly curved in some areas but straight in others. The largest channel observed presents a 'perfect' straight passage of airflow running from the very bottom of the bed to the very top of the bed. Channelling inside a burning bed of solid waste in a large-scale travelling grate incinerator plant was also investigated using a unique in-house prototype instrument. The result shows that the combustion processes within the bed were dominated largely by the circles of formation and subsequent collapse of channels.

AB We evaluated the effects of a 5 week (25 sessions); (30-35 min/day, 5 days/week), respiratory muscle training (RMT) program in nine competitive male cyclists. The experimental design included inspiratory resistance strength training (3-5 min/session) and hyperpnea endurance training (30 min/session), a placebo group which used a sham hypoxic trainer (n = 8), and three exercise performance tests, including a highly reproducible 8 km time trial test. RMT intensity, measured once a week in terms of accumulated inspiratory pressure and the level of sustainable hyperpnea increased significantly after 5 weeks (+ 64% and + 19%, respectively). The RMT group showed a significant 8% increase in maximal inspiratory pressure (P < 0.05) while the placebo group showed only a 3.7% increase (P > 0.10). RMT and placebo groups both showed significant increases in the fixed work-rate endurance test performance time (+ 26% and + 16%, respectively) and in the peak work-rate achieved during the incremental maximal oxygen consumption (V over dot(O2) max) test (+ 9 and + 6%). The 8 km time trial performance increased 1.8 +/- 1.2% (or 15 +/- 10 see; P < 0.01) in the RMT group with 8 of 9 subjects increasing; the placebo group showed a variable non-significant change in 5 of 8 subjects (- 0.3 +/- 2.7%, P = 0.07). The changes observed in these three performance tests were not, however, significantly different between the RMT and placebo groups. Heart rate, ventilation, or venous blood lactate, at equal work-rates during the incremental exercise test or at equal times during the fixed work-rate endurance test were not changed significantly across these exercise trials in either group. We propose that the effect of RMT on exercise performance in highly trained cyclists does not exceed that in a placebo group. Significant placebo and test familiarization effects must be accounted for in experimental designs utilizing performance tests which are critically dependent on volitional effort.

TI Building the sustainable community: Is social capital the answer?
SO SOCIOLOGICAL INQUIRY
LA English
DT Article
ID PLACE
AB Over the past decade, environmental sustainability has emerged as a prominent theme in the community development literature. In fact, the concept has become a standard feature of most economic and social development plans. Most models of sustainable community development stress the importance of widespread participation in the decision-making process. Unfortunately, community studies document numerous barriers to broad involvement and the high level of activeness envisioned by proponents of sustainable community development. In searching for ways to overcome these barriers, scholars and policymakers have embraced the idea that we can enhance efforts to create more sustainable communities by increasing the local stock of social capital. We examine this line of reasoning in light of what we view as the most important conceptual issues surrounding the relationship between social capital and sustainable community development. We conclude that before social capital is endorsed as a central component of public policy, much work remains to be done in terms of developing a more precise definition of the concept, situating it within extant theories of community, constructing better measures of social capital, documenting the activities and networks most important in building social capital, and gaining a better understanding of the forms of social capital that are most important in developing sustainable communities.

TI Building community from "scratch": Forces at work among urban Vietnamese
   refugees in Milwaukee
SO SOCIOLOGICAL INQUIRY
LA English
DT Article
AB Drawing from extensive participant observation and qualitative interviewing, this paper describes and analyzes the Vietnamese "community" in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The author concludes that community, both as an element that is sensed by its members and a process identified by actual interaction, is virtually nonexistent. Ten specific forces that inhibit community formation are identified under the overlapping categories of demographics, organizational issues, cultural factors, and class/power interests. The underlying tendencies toward family isolationism and radical individualism are implicated as driving social forces that undermine community building. Lessons learned from this case study about the process of community formation include the insufficiency of a common "enemy" or ethnic identity for sustainable community, social psychological issues, and environmental influences, as well as survival needs.

ID REGENERATION
AB State regimes have launched policies to "reinvent' government and "regenerate" communities in peripheral impoverished rural and urban areas to build sustainable communities and reduce poverty. We investigate the impact of policy concepts-the empowerment paradigm, citizenship as citizen participation and inclusion, and associations between the state and civil society-on local areas' success in leveraging dollars to foster sustainable economic and community development in persistently poor rural areas of the US. The thirty-three rural sites of the Empowerment Zone/Enterprise Communities Initiative of the Clinton-Gore Administration comprise our database. We find that empowering area-based, low-income residents through the election mechanism to choose their representatives on the local sites' governing board is strongly and significantly related to both inclusion and citizen participation. Also, the presence of elected citizens with connections to civil society on the governing body contributes strongly to later success in leveraging dollars.

TI Enhancing the mineralizable nitrogen pool through substrate diversity in
   long term cropping systems
SO SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL

ID SOIL; FIELD; SUSTAINABILITY; RHIZOSPHERE; POTENTIALS; ROTATIONS;
   RESIDUES
AB The development of sustainable N management systems requires a better understanding of the contribution of on-farm resources to the active N pool size and its mineralization. This study explores the effect of substrate diversity on improving N supply through mineralization. A "diverse system", consisting of a corn (Zea mays L.)-cornsoybean (Glycine max L.)-wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) rotation with cover crops and fertilized with composted manure was compared with a corn monoculture with conventional fertilizers. Nitrogen mineralization was measured in situ and in laboratory incubations as was the ability of each soil to mineralize added compost and red clover (Trifolium pratense) residue in the 6th and 7th yr of rotation. Net mineralized N in the diverse system was 90 and 40% higher than that in the monoculture at 70 and 150 d of laboratory incubations respectively. Comparable response was found in situ where a 70% higher net mineralization was observed in the diverse system at 70 d. The 70 and 150-d mineralizable N pools increased over time, but the ability of soil organisms to break down additional substrate did not change as a result of system diversity. At 150 d of laboratory incubation, a synergistic effect was observed when 5 Mg ha(-1) of compost plus 5 Mg ha (1) of clover was added to either soil. The combination of the two organic materials mineralized more N than the sum of their individual mineralization results. A more diverse cropping system may increase the soil's capacity to supply N to a growing crop while maintaining desirable levels of soil organic matter. This is essential for the overall long-term productivity and sustainability of agricultural systems.

ID CROP PRODUCTIVITY; ORGANIC-MATTER; RATES
AB Intensification of tropical agricultural systems by increasing fertilizer input and technology is a current trend in developing regions. Under intensive management, erosion impacts on crop productivity may not be detected in the short term. However, long-term impacts are expected because erosion rates in tropical agroecosystems are usually greater than the rate of soil formation. A temporal function of soil-depth change was defined and named life rime. Conceptually, soil's life time is the time until a minimum soil depth needed for sustaining crop production is reached. The life-time function was applied to the Ceveiro watershed (1990 ha) located at the Southeastern part of Brazil, and compared with sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum L.) yield loss estimations. Soil erosion prediction was made employing the Water Erosion Prediction Project. The mean soil erosion rate for the area was 15 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1), and sugarcane showed the highest mean value of 31 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1). The half life time of the watershed, i.e., the time until 50% of the area reach the minimum soil depth, was estimated to +563 yr in relation to present time. The estimated time for sugarcane's productivity to be reduced to 50% of the present value (half yield life time) was +361 yr. The life-time function was similar to the estimated long-term impacts of soil erosion on crop productivity. Therefore, the life-time function was considered as an integrative indictor for agricultural sustainability, useful for land-use planning and for the definition of tolerable soil erosion.

AB The restoration of mangroves has received a lot of attention world wide for several reasons. Firstly, the long ignored ecological and environmental values of mangrove forests have been documented for many mangrove areas in the world. Secondly, there is a high subsistence dependence on natural resources from mangrove forests, In addition, large losses of mangroves have occurred throughout the world leading to coastal erosion, decline of fishery resources and other environmental consequences, some of which in need of urgent attention. Finally, governments throughout the world are showing commitments towards sustainable use of mangrove areas. This paper outlines the activities of mangrove restoration and management around the world with particular emphasis on Eastern Africa. As noted here, extensive research has been carried out on the ecology, structure and functioning of the mangrove ecosystem. However, the findings have not been interpreted in a management framework, thus mangrove forests around the world continue to be over-exploited, converted to aquaculture ponds, and polluted. We strongly argue that links between research and sustainable management of mangrove ecosystems should be established.

TI A phytochemical basis for the potential use of Warburgia salutaris

ID AFRICAN PLANTS; SESQUITERPENOIDS; MEDICINE
AB WARBURGIA SALUTARIS (CANELLACEAE) is an important, over-exploited African ethnomedicinal plant threatened with extinction in the wild. The presence of biologically active drimane sesquiterpenoid lactone constituents in the leaves, here demonstrated, provides flee rational basis for their substitution for bark in ethnomedicine. Such replacement would permit more sustainable harvesting of Warburgia trees, and probably Improve returns on its commercial cultivation. A novel quantitative H-1 NMR procedure was used to determine ratios of polygodial to warburganal in both leaf and bark samples of five trees of Zululand stock, The Mann-Whitney U-test showed that differences in constituent ratios between the two plant organ types were statistically non-significant.

   CONTEXT
AB This paper presents the results of a cross-sectional biomedical and social survey, conducted in a major goldmining centre with a high prevalence of HIV infection. It also provides the baseline data for a comprehensive intervention programme. Our sample comprised a stratified random group of migrant mineworkers and of the resident adult population living in the community close to the mines and a small convenience sample of sex workers. In total, 2231 people between 13 and 59 years of age were interviewed using a structured questionnaire covering a wide range of psychological, behavioural and social issues. Blood and urine samples were collected and tested for the presence of HIV and syphilis antibodies and infection with Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis. The prevalence of HIV was high in all groups: 22% of the men and 37% of the women in the community, 29% of the mineworkers and 69% of the sex workers, were infected with HIV. The prevalence of other sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and especially syphilis, was also high in all four groups of people. Levels of migrancy were highest among mineworkers and sex workers. Migrants had a higher prevalence of casual partners than more permanent residents. More than 43 of the men in the study were circumcised and circumcision appears to offer some protection from HIV infection but not from other STIs. Knowledge about HIV was high but perceived vulnerability was low, which contributed to a high prevalence of unsafe behaviours. Social capital was also associated with HIV infection, with membership of sports clubs, youth clubs, burial societies and churches offering a protective effect against infection, while membership of stokvels (rotating credit associations) was associated with an increased chance of infection. Successful and sustainable intervention programmes must include a range of activities tailored to the needs of the community. Community-based peer education, focus group discussion and involvements of stakeholders should be complemented with syndromic management of STIs as well as periodic presumptive treatment of the sex workers, a partner notification system and training for local physicians.

AB Floods are an important abiotic factor regulating stream fish assemblages. Alterations to the natural hydrograph (e.g., water storage and diversion dams) which have reduced or eliminated flooding have been blamed, in part, for the decline of many native fishes in the desert Southwest. Proposals to divert water from the upper 72 km of the Verde River of Arizona have raised concerns about the sustainability of native fish populations. I examined the relationship between late winter/early spring flooding and recruitment of roundtail chub, Gila robusta, to age I in an unregulated section of the upper Verde River, Arizona, and determined if significant differences in mean catch per unit effort (CPUE) of age 1 roundtail chub existed over an 11-year period. A strong positive relationship between maximum mean daily discharge in year, and mean CPUE of age I roundtail chub in year,, was apparent. Mean CPUE of age I roundtail chub significantly increased or remained high in years following a flood in late winter/early spring of the previous year. and significantly decreased or remained low in years without flooding. Conversely, mean CPUE of subadult/adult roundtail chub did not significantly differ among years; thus, whether or not periodic strong year-classes are needed to maintain adult populations is uncertain. Nonetheless, recruitment of roundtail chub, and possibly other native fishes, to age 1 appears to be dependent on late winter/early spring floods, and a reduction in flood frequency likely would be detrimental to native fishes.

AB This paper presents the results of an inquiring process conceived as learning for action. The focus of the inquiry was the creation of some initial conditions considered necessary for the design of Evolutionary Learning Community (ELC) - an ideal alternative learning system that seeks to catalyze the purposeful creation of sustainable and evolutionary futures. These conditions included: (1) an idealized operational definition of ELC; (2) a description of the personal attributes of the potential designers of ELC; and (3) the design of a learning framework for empowering designers of ELC. The particular approach used was Evolutionary Systems Design: a systemic heuristic based on social systems design and complemented with an evolutionary and critical systems perspectives. The inquiry involved a theoretical exploration that was enriched with the experiences and perspectives of a group of individuals-who are involved in areas of work relevant for the design of ELC, such as systems design, community development, educational change, and environmental sustainability-who engaged with the author and principal researcher in learning conversations.

AB Sustainable development is an inherently temporal concept that includes future generations and their needs. We can improve the understanding of the concept if we explicitly start with a temporal perspective. The timescape framework is demonstrated as a useful tool to see the relevance of temporal diversity to direct our economy and way of life into the direction of sustainable development.

AB This article investigates the role of the time factor (tempo, rhythms, temporalities, etc.) for the concept of sustainable consumption - a factor which has been systematically neglected in the sustainability debate. After presenting some basic considerations regarding the theoretical conception of sustainable consumption, some applications for strategies and policies to further sustainable consumption are shared. This is followed by a chapter on the so-called 'new models of wealth' that are conceived as the ideal way to create more sustainable lifestyles. Here, one of the central visions is the idea of 'wealth in time' complementing 'wealth in goods'. The article concludes with a call for a systematic inclusion of the time factor in a theory of sustainable consumption.

TI Effects of mixed-metric data on production model estimation: Simulation
   study of a blue-marlin-like stock
SO TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY
LA English
DT Article
ID SURPLUS-PRODUCTION-MODEL; MAKAIRA-NIGRICANS; ATLANTIC; GROWTH; AGE
AB An underlying assumption of surplus-production modeling is that the model's two basic data streams (indices of abundance and records of catch) are expressed in the same metric, either biomass or numbers. For lack of data, that assumption is sometimes violated; recent assessments of blue marlin Makaira nigricans, and white marlin Tetrapturus albidus in the Atlantic Ocean, for example, have used indices of abundance based on numbers with indices of catch based on biomass. We examined the effects of using mixed-metric data in production modeling. Our method was a simulation study based on the life history and fishery characteristics of blue marlin in the Atlantic Ocean. Populations were simulated over a range of growth patterns and with either increasing or declining abundance by the use of a simulation model incorporating sex, size, and age structure; sexually dimorphic growth; variation of size at age; a.-e-varying natural mortality; and deterministic or stochastic recruitment. Simulated abundance data were aggregated across ages and combined with random errors to represent the data sets used in assessments. A logistic surplus-production model was then fitted to those simulated data sets. The resulting estimates of maximum sustainable yield and stock status were surprisingly robust to the use of mixed-metric data. Estimates from consistent data were generally more precise but not necessarily less biased. We thus conclude that this use of mixed-metric data is acceptable for blue marlin and similar species. However, errors in estimation varied strongly by the growth pattern assumed, which indicates that better knowledge of growth patterns would allow future assessments to better define likely biases arising from the use of mixed-metric data.

AB The work presented in this paper is aimed at investigating the economic effects of air pollution from mobile sources on public health in Lebanon. It is part of the effort to implement MedPolicies Initiative of the Mediterranean Environmental Technical Assistance Program (METAP III whose objective is to encourage sustainable economic growth through the integration of environmental concerns in economic and fiscal policy-making in 13 Mediterranean countries. In each of these countries, the most significant sector is investigated. The transport sector in Lebanon is the predominant sector in terms of energy consumption and its associated air pollution impacts. A multidisciplinary effort is carried out for this purpose in which measurement and modeling of air pollution caused by motor vehicles, determination of the quantitative relationship between pollutants and public health, and an estimation of the effects of air pollution on public health have been carried out. This study is concluded by highlighting the mitigation options applicable for the country and for similar developing nations from social and economic points of view. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

ID VECTOR CONTROL; AFRICA; PROGRAMS; NETS
AB Roll back malaria (RBM) aims at halving the current burden of the disease by the year 2010. The focus is on sub-Saharan Africa, and it is proposed to implement efficacious and cost-effective control strategies. But the evidence base of such information is scarce, and a notable missing element is the discussion of the potential of environmental management. We reviewed the literature and identified multiple malaria control programmes that incorporated environmental management as the central feature. Prominent among them are programmes launched in 1929 and implemented for two decades at copper mining communities in Zambia. The full package of control measures consisted of vegetation clearance, modification of river boundaries, draining swamps, oil application to open water bodies and house screening. Part of the population also was given quinine and was sleeping under mosquito nets. Monthly malaria incidence rates and vector densities were used for surveillance and adaptive tuning of the environmental management strategies to achieve a high level of performance. Within 3-5 years, malaria-related mortality, morbidity and incidence rates were reduced by 70-95%. Over the entire 20 years of implementation, the programme had averted an estimated 4173 deaths and 161205 malaria attacks. The estimated costs per death and malaria attack averted were US$ 858 and US$ 22.20, respectively. Over the initial 3-5 years start-up period, analogous to the short-duration of cost-effectiveness analyses of current studies, we estimated that the costs per disability adjusted life year (DALY) averted were US$ 524-591. However, the strategy has a track record of becoming cost-effective in the longer term, as maintenance costs were much lower: US$ 22-92 per DALY averted. In view of fewer adverse ecological effects, increased sustainability and better uses of local resources and knowledge, environmental management - integrated with pharmacological, insecticidal and bednet interventions - could substantially increase the chances of rolling back malaria.

DE China; water management; water law; water policy contradictions
AB External assessment of China's water problems, and recommendations for policy solutions, often fail to recognize interrelated physical, institutional, historical-cultural, and ideologically-grounded contradictions in the water sphere, distinctive to China, that challenge Chinese policy makers in unique ways. Is new market-based approaches to flood and drought prevention and control, water quality maintenance, adequate water supply, and ecological support are being discussed and implemented, problems of overcoming deep-seated contradictions in the water economy compel searching review of policy assumptions and strategies which force reconsideration and modification of longstanding strategies and procedures for managing water resources. This paper considers the implications of water policy contradictions and challenges in four key areas: (1) coordination of economic measures and legal constraints associated with a 1988 Water Law; (2) a major 1999 policy shift from emphasis on strutural engineering solutions in shuili (water management) enterprise to a broader resource-defined concept of "resource" water management (ziyuanshuili) in support of water sustainability; (3) continuing reference to traditional historical/cultural and Marxist theoretical perspectives despite increasing adoption of Western market-based instruments in water policy development; and (4) problems of modifying and adapting indigenous water science and engineering in the process of building a new water economy. The paper concludes that bilateral and multilateral efforts to ameliorate China's water problems may be successful in achieving limited technical objectives in the several water sectors but face difficulties in contributing to China's long-term water sustainability and hazard mitigation because they are insensitive to internal contradictions that are being addressed with ever greater intensity and urgency in the quest for solutions.

AB Theoretical principles of sustainable aquifer management are laid out in this work. The premise of our treatment is that groundwater is a renewable, although exhaustible, natural resource. The theory of this work is aimed at aquifers with a relatively homogeneous recharge that can be approximated by a logistic growth function. Sustainable aquifer exploitation occurs when the rate of groundwater extraction is equal to or less than the natural rate of groundwater replenishment for any level of aquifer storage. There can be many levels of sustainable aquifer exploitation depending on the level of aquifer storage, but there may be only one that maximizes economic returns under a variety of economic and aquifer conditions. Different strategies for sustainable exploitation are derived depending on whether or not the analysis considers tradeoffs among: (i) current and future exploitation; (H) constant and dynamic aquifer storage conditions; and (iii) regulated and unregulated aquifer exploitation. Key factors affecting sustainable exploitation strategies include: (1) the market price of groundwater; (2) the cost of groundwater extraction; (3) the aquifer storage and natural replenishment characteristics; (4) institutional and environmental regulations on groundwater extraction; and (5) the real discount rate. An example of sustainable groundwater exploitation in Santa Barbara, California, illustrates the methods of this article.

AB Unanticipated questions arose when starting an institutional research ethics committee in Grenada, Research ethics committees are charged with the ethical review of research protocols, They serve to protect people who volunteer as research subjects from harm or wrong that may result from participating in research. The Caribbean has a rich history of medical research involving human subjects. There is a growing will in the region to establish effective and sustainable research ethics committees that adhere to international standards. This paper examines uncertainties and questions that arose in starting a research ethics committee in Grenada, and describes how uncertainties were resolved The questions centre on which guidelines to follow, who to appoint as members, what procedures to follow, and how to train members. An additional question relates to the role of a Ministry of Health in founding a research ethics committee. Resolution of these uncertainties shows that ethical review of research can be both effective and sustainable in the Caribbean.

AB Although the main theoretical framework determining how to exploit populations was derived almost 50 years ago, overexploitation is common. I review 10 major concepts underlying the regulation of exploitation: population increase can be exploited; density dependence is essential; quantifying density dependence is exceedingly difficult; sustainable exploitation involves reducing population size; population growth rate is usually mismeasured; sustainability has many conflicting definitions and the choice depends upon the objectives; it is better to monitor the population than the harvest; quotas are unstable; increasing effort is simple, reducing it is painful; exploit conservatively. I then give a brief account of each of the nine main methods that are used to determine sustainable exploitation and the uses, advantages and limitations of each. The nine techniques are: surplus production models, yield per recruit models, Robinson and Redford model, linking yield to recruitment and mortality, adjusting to population changes, comparing demography across sites, reducing to a fixed fraction of unexploited population size, full population models and adaptive management.

AB The sustainability of exploitation is based on density-dependent renewal of populations: when population density decreases as some individuals are taken, the remaining individuals compensate by surviving or reproducing better. In general there is a trade-off between two desired outcomes: a high yield and a high remaining population size. A hunting strategy is Pareto optimal if it balances this trade-off without wasting possibilities of improving the performance in either aspect. Lack of knowledge concerning the age structure, mating system or density dependence operating in a population will very easily cause suboptimality in this sense, whereas utilising knowledge of density dependence may, in some cases, even overcome the conflict between the goals, so that harvesting can increase rather than decrease population sizes. Suboptimal timing of harvesting is an example which not only causes unnecessary harm to a population, but also hampers estimation of the compensatory or additive nature of mortality. A bias towards additivity will be found if hunting and natural mortality overlap in time, and even 'superadditive' results are possible. A mortality pattern that appears additive cannot, therefore, be used to deduce that overwinter survival is density independent. These results have consequences to harvest planning. Adjusting the length of the open season is a tool frequently used to regulate the harvest. Since estimated slopes of compensation cannot be assumed to remain constant if the timing of the open season is changed, the effect of a prolonged season will be more drastic than a mere change in kill rates would predict. Such factors are likely to have the strongest effects in species with long harvest seasons, such as many migratory European waterfowl.

AB Virtual population analysis (cohort analysis) was used to reconstruct past dynamics of a harvested population of martens Martes americana in the Bracebridge District of southern Ontario. Harvests in the Bracebridge District were managed using a quota system set by regional authorities. Quotas changed from year to year, apparently on the basis of past trapping success and variation in the proportion of young-of-the-year among harvested animals. The proportion of young in the harvest was a sensitive indicator of the annual rate of increase, whereas trapping success tended to be linked most strongly, in inverse fashion, with marten harvesting quotas. The proportion of martens harvested each year was constant, averaging 34%, despite 3-fold variation in marten abundance. This proportion was very close to the maximum sustainable yield (36%) for the population, suggesting that the management policy in the administrative unit was effective in the past in sustaining the source population as well as yielding high trapping returns. Monte Carlo simulation showed that proportionate harvesting, such as the policy in the Bracebridge District during 1972-1991, should be considerably less likely to lead to overharvesting than a constant quota policy, particularly at high average yields.

AB An array of models for sustainable harvesting has been proposed, and most are in some way dependent on a density-dependent response. I tested a subset of these models by manipulating three North American deer populations to reveal density dependence and determine population response to harvests. These were a white-tailed deer Odocoileus virginianus population on the George Reserve (GR) in southeastern Michigan, and black-tailed deer O. hemionus columbianus populations on Hopland Research and Extension Center (HREC) in Mendocino County, California, and on Fort Hunter Liggett (FHL) in Monterey County, California. The study areas represented a gradation in size, productivity, management control, and environmental stochasticity. The GR population showed a nearly linear density-dependent relationship of r on N. A mean maximum sustainable yield (MSY) of 49 deer/year was obtained at an N of 56% of K carrying capacity (KCC). A fixed harvest with stochasticity, however, reduced the sustainable MSY to 43 deer/year. A second population growth experiment 50 years after the initial introduction showed an equivalent growth rate. Analysis of harvest data from FHL showed buck harvest to be positively related to size of previous female harvests. From these results, a 'linked-sex harvest strategy' (LSHS) was proposed in which female harvest is sequentially incremented so long as buck harvest continues to increase, up to a presumed 'safe' female to buck ratio. At HREC, bucks were harvested in public bucks-only seasons. Buck harvest was monitored for 6-year pre- and post-treatment periods without female removals, and for a 7-year treatment period during which 20 females/year were removed for three years and 30 females/year for four years. There was no significant difference in pre- and post-treatment period buck harvests, so they were combined as a 'control'. There was a significant (25%) increase in buck harvest during the treatment period despite its coinciding with six consecutive years of drought. The combined-sex harvest was more than double that of the buck harvest alone during the control periods. The relevance of these studies to deer harvest management is discussed.

AB Willow ptarmigan Lagopus lagopus is considered a popular small game species by many hunters in Scandinavia. A simple harvest strategy would be to prohibit harvest in parts of the total area. We used a spatial model of a fluctuating population of willow ptarmigan, divided into 25 subareas to investigate the possible advantages of buffer zones in managing harvest. We let the breeding success be the source of annual environmental stochasticity but without any spatial variation. Survival was assumed to be density dependent over the total area, whereas dispersal was modelled as density independent. We then compared four major scenarios in which we let dispersal and harvest vary. About 75% of the area could be left open to hunting even if the level of harvest was close to the extinction level if executed in all grids. This harvest strategy would be particularly advantageous if the goal is to provide as many hunting opportunities as possible, rather than to harvest a maximum sustainable yield. Furthermore, it is quite simple and does not need a resource-demanding control system. We believe that a harvest strategy which sets aside a part of the area as a buffer, and places a limit to the harvest effort in the grids that are open for hunting, would be a cost-efficient system with only a small risk of overharvesting.

CT 9th PTS-CTP-Deinking Symposium

AB To measure macrosized adhesive material, the so-called Haindl method was developed in the Schongau mill. Applying this method, numerous screenings of adhesives and associated optimisation projects were undertaken in the period from 1994 to 1999. However, this highly selective method was extremely time-consuming. In 1999, this INGEDE Method No. 4 was introduced which immediately ousted the previous method and which yields results of an equivalent quality Compared to the Haindl method, the INGEDE method enables a higher number of small-sized adhesives to be measured by an advanced technique. Thanks to modem image analysis, it is now possible to identify and evaluate adhesive size distributions.
   At the Schongau mill, adhesives are primarily measured as part of off-schedule investigations that are aimed at optimising screen baskets or process steps. Routine measurements of adhesives are conducted only once a month. When applied over a period of several years, adhesive measurements help to identify numerous trends, to interpret them and to derive targeted strategies. At the Schwedt mill, the adhesives content of the stock was reduced to nearly one-third by adopting suitable optimisation measures. At the same time, the adhesive elimination rate for the overall plant was increased from approx. 90 % to > 98 %. Besides, adhesive measurements are a useful tool for optimising the baskets used in prescreening and post-screening stages. Specifically, basket designs and screening parameters ha ve been derived which are very promising in terms of reducing adhesive levels. In order to measure not only adhesives, but also stickies, and to enable detailed conclusions as to the deposit-dependent operation of the paper machine, the Schongau mill has recently been watching with interest the development of the FAG deposit analyzer by the Papermaking Institute of Darmstadt Technical University Initial analytical results ha ve shown Mat the propensity to deposit formation decreases with the adhesive contents along the processes of recovered paper treatment In die papermachine, adhesive levels have diminished, but deposition is still very high. In a single case, the FAG analyzer has already successfully demonstrated that an additive had been used that fosters deposition.
   In the eighties, problems arising from adhesives and PM deposits started to increase until they reached a critical point in the mid-nineties, especially in PM 7 which had gone on stream in 1989, Today, sticky deposits are only encountered temporarily in the wire section of the PM. At the Schwedt mill, deposition is practically unknown with adhesive contents in recycled-fibre pulps being below 100 mm(2)/kg. As far as the Schongau mill is concerned, online measurements of adhesives and stickies appear desirable as a process monitoring tool, but automated lab-scale measurements would of course be a more attractive alternative for process optimisation. Such automated deposit measurements might be achieved by advancing the FAG deposit analyzer. This development appears more promising and sustainable compared to an automated measurement of microstickies.
   Overall, low contents of macrosized adhesives together with minimised deposits are a basic prerequisite for effective control of deposition phenomena in paper machines.

TI Productivity growth and sustainability in post-Green Revolution
   agriculture: The case of the Indian and Pakistan Punjabs
SO WORLD BANK RESEARCH OBSERVER
LA English
DT Article
ID SOUTH-ASIA; POLICY; WHEAT
AB This article attempts to determine the long-term productivity and sustainability of irrigated agriculture in the Indian and Pakistan Punjabs by measuring trends in total factor productivity for production systems in both states since the advent of the Green Revolution. These measurements over time and across systems have resulted in three major findings. First, there were wide spatial and temporal variations between the two Punjabs. Although output growth and crop yields were much higher in the Indian Punjab, productivity growth was higher by only a small margin. Moreover, the lowest growth in productivity took place during the initial Green Revolution period (as opposed to the later intensification and post-Green Revolution periods) and in the wheat-rice system in both states. The time lag between adoption of Green Revolution technologies and realization of productivity gains is related to learning-induced efficiency gains, better utilization of capital investments over time, and problems with the standard methods of productivity measurement that downwardly bias estimates, particularly during the Green Revolution period. Second, input growth accounted for most of the output growth in both Punjabs during the period under study. Third, intensification, especially in the wheat-rice system, resulted in resource degradation in both Punjabs. Data from Pakistan show that resource degradation reduced overall productivity growth from technical change and from education and infrastructure investment by one-third. These findings imply the need for policies that promote agricultural productivity and sustainability through public investments in education, roads, and research and extension; and that reduce resource degradation by decreasing or eliminating subsidies that encourage intensification of inputs.

TI The politics of Russian enterprise reform: Insiders, local governments,
   and the obstacles to restructuring
SO WORLD BANK RESEARCH OBSERVER
LA English
DT Article
AB Russia and other countries in the Commonwealth of Independent States that have implemented voucher privatization programs have to account for the puzzling behavior of insiders-manager-owners-who, in stripping assets from the firms they own, appear to be stealing from one pocket to fill the other. This article suggests that asset stripping and the absence of restructuring result from interactions between insiders and subnational governments in a particular property rights regime, in which the ability to realize value is limited by uncertainty and illiquidity. As the central institutions that govern the Russian economy have ceded their powers to the provinces, regional and local governments have imposed a variety of distortions on enterprises to protect local employment.
   To disentangle these vicious circles of control, this articles considers three sets of institutional changes: adjustments to the system of fiscal federalism by which subnational governments would be allowed to retain tax revenues generated locally: legal improvements in the protection of property rights; and the provision of mechanisms for restructuring and ownership transformation in insider-dominated firms. The aim of these reforms would be to change the incentives that local governments, owners, and investors face; to convince subnational governments that a more sustainable way of protecting employment lies in protecting local investment, to raise the cost of theft and corruption by insiders and local officials; and to allow investors to acquire controlling stakes in viable firms.

AB Isotopic measurements on groundwaters have been carried out on the Valreas Miocene aquifer. A strong isotopic contrast exists between the recharge area and the confined aquifer, suggesting limited hydraulic communications between these two portions. In the confined aquifer, radiometric velocities are 10 to 12 times smaller (0.2-0.4 m.yr(-1)) than hydraulic velocities (approximate to 2.2 m-yr(-1)). The overexploitation of the resource can have entailed a major change in the hydraulic gradients leading to a perturbation of the system and a gradual attenuation of the hydraulic barrier, which may threaten the sustainability and the quality of the resource.

ID LAKE NAIVASHA; KENYA
AB Long-term monitoring of wetlands is an essential element of management for 'wise use'. Indeed, the Ramsar Convention requires regular monitoring in order to detect changes in ecological character at listed sites. However, there are few examples of successful long-term monitoring in tropical wetlands. Monitoring schemes run into three kinds of difficulties: Conceptual, logistical and political. To be effective, monitoring schemes must be carefully planned and designed. In practice, the questions to be addressed are rarely made explicit. Strictly defined, monitoring should assess deviations from a pre-set level so that appropriate corrective action can be taken. This assumes that good baseline information exists, and that we have sufficient knowledge of the system to set sensible signal levels. Neither is usually the case in tropical wetlands. This means that carefully focused surveillance (a time-series of systematic observations) is an essential first step, Providing resources and co-ordination for surveillance or monitoring is challenging over the long term, especially if the variables being measured require expensive analyses and highly trained staff. I suggest that surveillance or monitoring programmes should focus on likely threat.,,, and ecological or economic concerns, should be as simple, robust and inexpensive as possible, should be sustained and consistent, and should involve local people and volunteers. If it is to be effective, monitoring must have a clear linkage to wetland management. Ideally, it should form part of each country's wetland policy. I suggest sonic variables that could be incorporated in sustainable long-term monitoring programmes. Two examples of successful surveillance,work at Kenyan wetlands illustrate (hat the challenges involved in long-term programmes can, at least in part, be overcome.

AB African wetlands have important functions and values in terms of the water cycle, water quality management and biodiversity, conservation, Especially relevant is their importance in food security, the provision of tradable products, and Cultural and aesthetic values for local riparian communities.
   In Africa, knowledge of the processes, functions and values of wetlands is slim: indeed, in many regions, wetland inventories are yet to be produced. A research strategy is proposed to address some of these issues recommending an intrinsically linked, two-pronged approach: i.e. (i) studies for inventories, assessment and monitoring of wetlands and (ii) research into processes, structure and functioning of wetland ecosystems. The former has an immediate urgency whilst the latter has a long-term perspective. It is argued that 'curiosity-driven', (basic) research should go hand-in-hand with problem-orientated applied) studies. Basic research is essential for a nation's scientific and technical empowerment and development. Priority topics include studies on biological diversity and integrated studies on wetlands and water resources (including water quality and the functions and values of wetland buffers).
   There is clear evidence of a shortage of expertise from within Africa for these topics and the reasons are discussed. Amongst others, blame is directed towards aid strategies from the industrial 'North' and individual research programmes by 'Northern' scientists in Africa. However, commitment in Africa to the actual process of scientific research is also wanting. Overall, the North have failed to stimulate a critical mass for research whilst the South suffer from a lack of momentum and from chronic under-investment.
   A research, training and capacity-building scheme is presented as a viable option for ameliorating the dearth of wetland resource professionals in Africa in which partnerships and networking of institutes from the North and South is encouraged.

AB Lake Victoria is an international freshwater resource of great ecological and economic importance. Large changes that have Occurred recently in the environment and the ecology of the take are associated with natural processes as well as anthropogenic activities in the catchment's area and the Lake itself. Data collected in the Kenyan waters of the Lake in June 1998 indicate that nutrient concentrations and algal biomass are higher than previously reported and that Socchi transparency has decreased. These are evidence of increasing nutrient enrichment and general decline in water quality. Increased algal blooms, depletions of dissolved oxygen, frequent large-scale mortalities of fish, decline of endemic fish species, predominance in the fishery by introduced species, changes in other biotic species composition, proliferation of the water hyacinth and increasing human health risks also manifest the ecological degradation of the Lake. Long-term conservation efforts for rehabilitation and sustainable management of the Lake are suggested.

AB This investigation has surveyed the plants and fishes of the Lower Sondu Miriu wetland and described their use by adjacent Communities. Poverty is endemic in the area. Fish samples were caught by beach seines, fence, weir traps, baskets, spears and gill-nets. A schedule (structured/openended) was used to discover the major local uses of wetland plants, A total of 37 species of aquatic plants were identified. The dominants were Cyperus papyrus L. (Papyrus), Eichhornia crassipes Mar(. Solms-Laubach (Water hyacinth), Vossia cuspidata Roxb. (Hippo grass) and Phragmites australis (Cav.) Trin. ex. Steud, (Reeds) in a descending order of dominance, The invasion of the wetland by Water hyacinth Eichhornia crassipes, which has lead to sudden disappearance of submerged macrophytes at the swamp-lake interface zone, is reported here for the first time. Twelve families consisting of 28 species of fish were identified, the bulk of which consisted of the indigenous fish species of Lake Victoria. A dependence on the wetland plants for the supply Of building material and cooking fuel is highlighted. Traditional use is recommended as opposed to commercial-scale enterprise and industry based on swamp plants. since subsistence utilization is compatible with sustainable utilization.

AB A collaborative international project funded by the European Union's INCO-DC programme is undertaking limnological, fish biological, environmental and socio-economic research in five tropical lakes and reservoirs in Sri Lanka, Thailand and the Philippines over the period 1998-2001. The aim is to determine their trophic structure and their capacity to sustain both their existing Fisheries and present and future aquaculture. In some cases, these activities could potentially be expanded for the benefit of rural communities and of the local market within the bounds of social and environmental sustainability. This paper describes the concepts and methods involved in this innovative multidisciplinary project which aims to integrate limnological, fisheries and socio-economic issues in a comparative approach involving Asian and European research teams.

AB The management of the utilisation of natural resources from wetland ecosystems is a multiobjective and complex task. The creation of innovative decision making tools for sustainable wetland resource utilisation is an important challenge for the future. This is particularly crucial in the light of (lie growing shortages for high quality freshwater and the vanishing habitat for a large number of wetland fauna and flora species. Because wetlands combine attributes of both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, wetlands are often at the crossroads of a number of disciplines with no specific discipline of its own. Therefore, management programmes require a multidisciplinary approach founded oil a systematic monitoring of key biological and physical parameters. A European Commission DG XII research project dedicated to the development of management tools for wetland resources in Latin America is being developed by a multidisciplinary team of researchers from eight universities, located in four EU member states, Argentina and Brazil. The study sites that will be utilised for this analysis are two shallow lakes in Northeast Argentina within the large (13 000 km(2)) wetland 'Esteros del Ibera'. Continuous and periodic in-situ monitoring instrumentation has been installed in a long term monitoring programme of hydrological and meteorological factors, coupled with monthly biological and ecological data gathering. Potential future scenarios for wetland resource use are being discussed in a series of public meetings with key provincial and local actors (teachers, university professors, clergymen, local business persons and politicians). These meetings address both the small scale modifications of wetland use (water extraction for agriculture, tourism, controlled hunting) as well as regional projects related to the creation of large scale economic development (forestation, modification of nearby waterways for hydroelectric production and increased river transportation), Models are developed relating the chemical, physical, biological and ecological parameters monitored. These models will be dedicated to analysing the effects of development oil wetland functions and resource quality. An economic model will be created to evaluate potential modifications in wetland functions in the local and regional socio-economic context. Evaluation instruments are developed and tested which include; qualitative models using loop analysis, goal functions based on the aquatic trophic web and the overall energy flux in the lagoon, and a geographical information system utilising satellite images. The purpose of these instruments is to examine the overall impacts of development alternatives on resource quality and ecosystem integrity, as well as demonstrating key parameters that should be more closely monitored. The final package will include an evaluation of the potential impacts of the development scenarios proposed by the key actors, recommendations to reduce specific impacts through alternative technologies, together with a monitoring programme and analysis tools for improved decision making in wetland resource management.

AB Mangroves form important ecosystems in Kenya's coastal areas. They produce goods and services that are of environmental, ecological and economic importance to human society. However, mangroves are under continuing pressure from anthropogenic disturbances. A particular concern has been the clearing of mangrove areas to reclaim land for other uses such as aquaculture, Salt manufacture, agriculture and housing. About 10 000 ha of mangrove areas have been cleared for salt manufacture between Ngomeni and Karawa, while in Lamu, close to 100 ha of mangrove forest was killed by dredged-up sediment that was deposited during the construction of the Mokowe sea jet. 100 ha of mangrove area have been converted for aquaculture at Ngomeni. At Gazi Bay, about 100 ha of mangrove forests was cleared for fuelwood and in Makupa Creek, Mombasa, 10 ha of mangroves died due to oil pollution. The total area lost is therefore 10 3 10 ha which represents about 20% of the total mangrove forest.
   In this paper, deforestation, conversion of mangrove areas for other land uses and pollution of mangrove swamps on the Kenyan coast are discussed and a call for sustainable use, and the government policies that will enable this, is made.

AB Novel chitosan microspheres with lower cytotoxicity were fabricated in this study and their drug release characteristics were investigated. Genipin, a naturally occurring crosslinking reagent that has been used in herbal medicine and in the production of food dye, was used to prepare crosslinked chitosan microspheres by a water-in-oil dispersion method. The crosslinking mechanism examined by FTIR and C-13-NMR suggests that the crosslinking of chitosan by genipin leads to the formation of secondary amide and heterocyclic amino linkage. The polycation-anionic drug interaction between chitosan and indomethacin was pH dependent and could affect the dissolution property of indomethacin. By examination of the release profiles of the crosslinked chitosan microsphere, it was found that the release of indomethacin from the microsphere was sustainable and influenced by factors such as crosslinking of microsphere and chitosan-indomethacin interaction, thus establishing crosslinked chitosan microsphere as a very promising polymeric carrier for drug release.

TI Introducing new products can be hazardous to your company: Use the right
   new-solutions delivery tools
SO ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT EXECUTIVE
LA English
DT Article
AB New-product failure rates remain exceptionally high despite increasing efforts by academic and corporate researchers to develop new theories and approaches to reverse this trend. The conventional wisdom that has emerged is useful, but insufficient to improve success rates. The leading innovators achieve success by moving beyond conventional wisdom to follow three emerging rules. In the past, managers obsessed about the product, obscuring the fact that what customers really want is a total solution to a problem. Similarly, managers too often emphasized the introduction of the new product at the expense of ensuring the delivery of the customer solution. Lastly, managers become internally absorbed, causing them to make decisions based on what is easiest for them and their company. The most successful marketers are, in a sense, schizophrenic. By simultaneously being able to become the customer, the competition, and their channel partner, they combine the right skills, capabilities, and resources to deliver superior customer solutions. just as important as having a superior product or service, a firm must build a better business model and a stronger network of value-delivery partners to get a sustainable competitive advantage in the marketplace. Competition is shifting from company versus company to network versus network. At a time when fickle marketplaces demand ever more innovation, progress in this area has never been more important.

AB The amount, the rate and the intensity of land use and land cover change are very high in developing countries. The human impacts upon the land are still very great and increasing. This study analyses the process of human-induced landscape transformation in a micro watershed in mid elevation zone of central Himalaya of India in 1963, 1986 and 1996. The watershed (about 80 km(2) in size) comprises a small mountainous valley with steep slopes and deep cut ravines, typical of the landscape pattern in high population intensity mid elevation zone of central Himalaya. The spatial and temporal change patterns of land use were quantified by interpreting remote sensing (RS) data and use a geographical information system (GIS). During the last 33 years, the vegetal cover was altered drastically with increasing population pressure (both human and animal), agricultural activities and industrial wood/raw material extraction activities. The traditional rain fed agriculture on raised terraces has passed through a process of agricultural intensification but this in turn reduced crop species diversity. Restriction on agricultural expansion by transferring large parts of vegetated areas to conservation forestry under government control and unrestrained agricultural expansion on community lands which supported fuel. fodder and manure requirements has resulted in a unbalanced land use. This in turn led to deforestation and environmental degradation. Some limiting factors such as socio-economic and policy forces caused these changes in natural resource management practices and the resulting land use patterns. The study showed that although development interventions such as World Bank aided Integrated Watershed Development Programme, etc., showed promising results in regenerating the resources, the lack of follow-up required after programme withdrawal might cause the deterioration of resources accrued during such regeneration activities. Such local impacts need to be considered in national policies and especially when time bound international aid based programmes are to be implemented, (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB As a consequence of the impact of sustainability on agricultural production systems, a standardized framework to monitor sustainable development would have great practical utility. The objective of this paper is to introduce fuzzy set theory and develop fuzzy mathematical models to assess sustainable development based on context-de pendent economic, ecological, and societal sustainability indicators. Membership functions are at the core of fuzzy models, and define the degree to which indicators contribute to development. Although a decision-making process regarding sustainable development is subjective. fuzzy set theory links human expectations about development, expressed in linguistic propositions, to numerical data, expressed in measurements of sustainability indicators. In the future, practical implementation of such models will be based on elicitation of expert knowledge to construct a membership function. The fuzzy models developed in this paper provide a novel approach to support decisions regarding sustainable development. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

SO AMBIO
LA English
DT Article
AB Local Agenda 21 (LA21) processes have 2 central goals. i) On the basis of some of the empirical evidence in this study, the primary goal is to improve democratic (environmental) policy-making processes in such a manner that a larger share of the population will be able to participate in planning and decision making and will also be able to understand the consequences of these decisions. ii) The LA21 processes seek to improve (at least indirectly) the broadly defined environmental situation locally in a manner that takes into account both the local and the i global contexts. The first part of this article discusses the concept and methods of LA21 and sheds light on the different action areas that are central to the Baltic LA21 processes. In addition, the study will describe and display the LA21 situation within one network of cities, the Union of the Baltic Cities (UBC). Networking, including transfer of information, models and ideas, has been among the main tools for the diffusion of LA21 ideas especially into newly democratized societies. Finally, the article will conclude with an overall assessment of the LA21 situation on the Baltic rim.

AB Hygiene refers to the science of the establishment and maintenance of (human) health. In everyday life, hygiene is closely associated with good housekeeping. This article will focus on home hygiene in relation to cleaning, on microorganisms, and on sustainable development of domestic technology. In domestic cleaning there are two beneficial effects: the aesthetic aspects of cleanness and the removal of microorganisms. In cleaning science substantial attention is paid to the interrelation between cleaning and removal of microorganisms. It appears that the parameters of the cleaning process and the detergent properties play a significant role in this interrelation. Changing technology to reduce the environmental impact of household cleaning not only influences the household activities and the functional performance of the cleaning processes but also has an impact on the level of hygiene. Results are presented of research in which the hygiene has been evaluated in relation to such changes. One option recently studied to reduce the environmental impact of households is the reduction of water consumption by water reuse. In such concepts water is used in successive steps for various processes before it is drained. The potential impact of such systems and of the use of rain water on the level of home hygiene is discussed.

AB Land degradation and pollution caused by population pressure and economic development pose a threat to the sustainability of the earth's surface, especially in tropical regions where a long history of chemical weathering has made the surface environment particularly Fragile. Systematic baseline geochemical data provide a means of monitoring the state of the environment and identifying problem areas. Regional surveys have already been carried out in some countries, and with increased national and international funding they can be extended to cover the rest of the land surface of the globe. Preparations have been made. under the auspices of the International Union of Geological Surveys (IUGS) and the International Association of Geochemistry and Cosmochemistry (IAGC) for the establishment of just such an integrated global database.

AB This paper is concerned with the motion of air within the urban street canyon and is directed towards a deeper understanding of pollutant dispersion with respect to various simple canyon geometries and source positions. Taking into account the present days typical urban configurations, three principal flow regimes "isolated roughness flow", "skimming flow" and "wake interference flow" (Boundary Layer Climates, 2nd edition, Methuen, London) and their corresponding pollutant dispersion characteristics are studied for various canopies aspect ratios, namely relative height (h(2)/h(1)), canyon height to width ratio (h/w) and canyon length to height ratio (l/h). A field-size canyon has been analyzed through numerical simulations using the standard k-epsilon turbulence closure model. It is found that the pollutant transport and diffusion is strongly dependent upon the type of flow regime inside the canyon and exchange between canyon and the above roof air. Some rules of thumbs have been established to get urban canyon geometries for efficient dispersion of pollutants. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB VORTEX computer simulations were used to assess the viability of a small breeding Beck of common cranes, recently established in Norfolk. Investigations were also conducted on the relative impact of various management options. Raising the carrying capacity of the site had little influence on the survival of the flock. However, great improvements were associated with increases in the size of the founder flock and reductions in the mortality rates of chicks and adults. Regularly supplementing the population increased hock survival times: for a fixed total number of birds added, fi frequently supplementing with few birds produced the best results. Immigration from the population in continental Europe also increased persistence of the Beck. and it is: possible that immigration rates will improve as the British Beck expands. Strategies including captive breeding, and regular supplementation of the flock. may be the most effective means of ensuring the viability of the Norfolk cranes. The potential value of simulation models in guiding man agement of small populations is discussed. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Paper waste, spiked with varying proportions of cowdung, was vermicomposted in 'low-rate` and 'high-rate' reactors. The former type of reactors had earthworm populations and feed loading rates similar to ones recommended by previous workers. The 'highrate' reactors were operated with 12.5 times higher earthworm densities and feed loading rates. All the reactors were studied for six months to assess the vermicast output, survivability, growth and reproduction of the earthworms hence the sustainability of the reactors - for long-term, continuous operation. The studies revealed the viability of the high-rate vermireactor concept. The highrate reactors consistently produced over 6.5 times more castings per unit digester volume with no adverse effect on the earthworm population, as reflected by (a) absence of mortality, (b) consistent growth in worm zoomass, and (c) normal rate of reproduction. The studies also revealed that an increase in the cowdung fraction in the feed from 14.3% to 20% (4:1 paper:cowdung blends to 6:1 blends) had little positive impact on the vermicast output or earthworm health. This indicated that spiking of paper feed with similar to 14% cowdung, or perhaps an even smaller fraction, might be adequate to support earthworms in the paper-fed vermireactors.

AB Soil samples were collected from beef pastures varying in species composition and fertilizer inputs after being grazed by cow-calf pairs for 4 yr (1995-1998) near Brandon, Manitoba. The objective of this experiment is to examine the impact of 4 yr of continuous rotational grazing on soil chemical properties and nutrient redistribution in mixed alfalfa-grass and pure-grass pastures with or without fertilization. Pastures were established on an Orthic Black Chernozemic, fine sandy-loam soil. Compared with N-fertilized pure-grass pastures, alfalfa-grass pastures had greater seasonal soil mineral-N supply, and tended to have higher total soil C, N and organic C. In grazed systems in this environment, the use of alfalfa as the primary N source may be more profitable and sustainable than using fertilizer N. However, considering the seasonal changes in soil nitrification rate observed in alfalfa-grass pastures, caution needs to be taken when stands with high legume content are used to maximize animal performance, because this may increase the risk of N losses into the environment. Fertilization over a 5-yr period (1994-1998) tended to lower surface soil pH. Application of P significantly increased soil "extractable" P levels in the top 15-cm soil layer. However, K fertilization only increased surface soil "extractable" K slightly compared with unfertilized pastures. There was also no effect of S application on soil "extractable" S. Zone effects on soil mineral N and soil "extractable" P, K and S were limited to the surface (0-7.5 cm). For mineral N, the zone effect seemed to be more pronounced in first rotation than in second rotation. The magnitude of K redistribution was greater than for S and P due to higher K intake and excretion. Use of rotational stocking with short grazing periods appears to have resulted in a relatively even redistribution of nutrients derived from animal excreta.

   quality of service; flat-rate vs. usage-based pricing
AB Currently, the Internet service provider market offers two different types of pricing plans. In the USA, the predominant pricing plan is a hat-rate plan. In Europe and Asia, the predominant one is a per-minute pricing plan. Enrolled in such a pricing plan, users have to pay for the connect time to the Internet. Although Internet Service Providers (ISPs) have competed heavily for users in these last few years, they only have focused on trying to offer the lowest price within such pricing plans. A potentially more profitable and sustainable method of doing business would be for ISPs to differentiate themselves by offering more customized pricing plans for certain user groups. An important question then is whether a pricing plan exists that is attractive to users, but also allows ISPs to build a sustainable business. Based on empirical results of the INternet Demand EXperiment (INDEX) project, we discuss a pricing plan for Internet access that appears to be appreciated by Internet users as well as by ISPs, This pricing plan combines the advantages of flat-rate pricing and usage-based pricing. Users will benefit by receiving unlimited access to a basic service with the choice of higher quality of service (QoS) whenever they demand. From the ISPs' perspective, such a pricing plan will help any ISP to focus on certain user' groups and to reduce peak network load, (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Frustration with the lack of action on conservation issues by governments bas sparked debate around the policy role of conservation biologists. We analyzed the political economy of conservation biology, that is, of the dynamics of the political and economic structures within which conservation biology operates, and we suggest more productive means for conservation biologists to achieve conservation goals. Within the modern state, conservation goals are marginalized because the growth needs of industrial capital have the highest priority. Environmental advocacy within this system largely addresses only proximate concerns and has limited success. Science is a product of modern society, but scientists now need to foster novel institutional arrangements in which humans can function within the limits of natural systems. This entails a larger recognition of the inherent contradictions residing within current institutions that themselves depend on unsustainably high resource flows. As one critical counterbalance to these institutions, we discuss community-based management and research as primary institutions through which sustainable use of natural resources might be achieved.

ID MANAGEMENT; FORESTS
AB Tropical conservation has seen a convergence between conservation projects and rural development, with both approaches promoting participation of local people in sustainable resource use. But there is a discord between rural development and sustainable use of wildlife. Implementing more sustainable use of wildlife usually means decreased economic benefits for rural people, especially over the short term. In contrast, rural-development projects are often mandated to generate income for rural people over the short term. We examined this dilemma through an integrated economic and harvest analysis of the costs associated with converting unsustainable bunting to more sustainable bunting in the Peruvian Amazon, Our analysis suggests that a change in bunting practice would have significant economic costs for rural people and would result in a 36% decrease in the economic benefits they derive from wildlife hunting. In contrast, converting unsustainable hunting to more sustainable hunting would have little effect on meat markets in the urban center of Iquitos, Peru, with markets losing only 3.6% of their economic value, There would be no economic costs for the international pelt trade. If rural-development projects absorb the short-term economic costs, they can help people convert unsustainable wildlife use to more sustainable use and assist rural people in realizing the long-term benefits of more sustainable bunting. But many rural-development projects would need to change their mandate for short-term income generation to incorporate the realities of sustainability.

AB Natural insecticides based on the entomopathogenic fungi Beauveria bassiana and Metarhizium anisopliae have been produced on an experimental scale in Nicaragua with a 6-month output for insect control on 1100 ha. Main target insects are the coffee berry borer Hypothenemus hampei, the diamond-backed moth Plutella xylostella, and spittlebugs (Aeneolamia spp. and Prosapia spp.) in sugarcane. The production process involves three life cycles of the fungus, first on solid culture medium, then on rice in Erlenmeyer flasks from which a liquid inoculum is obtained and finally on rice in polypropylene bags. The economic feasibility of scaling up the conidia production for an annual output to cover mycopesticide applications on 20,000 ha is calculated. Total investment for a complete new construction of facilities amounts to US$264,000. The estimated shelf prices of the products range from US$8.00 to US$12.00/ha. A net profit is obtained as soon as the output reaches 75% of full capacity, which is targeted for the third year. In the final year of the planning horizon of 10 years, at which time the debt has been serviced, the break-even ratio is reached at 56% of nominal capacity. The internal rate of return on the total investment is 12.7%. The production is economically sustainable if initial capital is provided below market interest rates via a research or development co-operation treaty. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

ID PESTICIDE USE; MANAGEMENT; POLICY; COSTS; QUALITY
AB Public policy toward pesticide use in agriculture can benefit from data coming from models that integrate ecological and economic constraints into cropping decisions and pesticide use. Herein we use such a model to focus on the environmental and economic effectiveness of a specific set of tools used to promote sustainable agriculture with less pesticide runoff - incentive-based instruments created by risk-indexed herbicide input-taxes. We measure risk by health advisory levels and by an ecological economic simulation model that estimates predicted exposure levels. We explore whether this innovative solution or herbicide input-taxes does better at reducing losses to farm net returns, and surface and groundwater loadings than quantity restrictions. Using the integrated CEEPES model, our results suggest that risk-indexed input taxes by information about individual herbicide exposure levels can be a cost-effective tool to reduce predicted groundwater exposures. No single policy, however, was efficient at simultaneously improving groundwater and surface water quality. Instead we construct an efficient policy set. We find exposure-induced taxes were most efficient for small percentage reductions in overall exposure, bans were efficient for medium reductions, and flat taxes were efficient for high reductions.

DE registered professional engineer; graduate curriculum; applied ecology
AB The demand for engineering solutions to ecosystem-level problems has increased as the impact of human activities has expanded to global proportions. While the science of restoration ecology has been developed to address many critical ecosystem management issues, the high degree of complexity;Ind uncertainty associated with these issues demands a more quantitative approach. Ecological engineering uses science-based quantification of ecological processes to develop and apply engineering-based design criteria for sustainable systems. We suggest that in the United States ecological engineering curricula should be offered at the graduate level and should require rigorous Accreditation Board of Engineering and Technology-accredited (or equivalent) undergraduate preparation in engineering fundamentals. In addition to strengthening students' mastery of engineering theory and application, the graduate curriculum should provide core courses in ecosystem theory including quantitative ecology, systems ecology. restoration ecology, ecological engineering, ecological modeling, and ecological engineering economics. Advanced courses in limnology, environmental plant physiology, ecological economics, and specific ecosystem design should be provided to address students' specific professional objectives. Finally, professional engineering certification must be developed to insure the credibility of this new engineering specialization. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This study indicates the potential utility of water hyacinth for nutrient removal and biomass production, based on the continuous harvest at the maximum sustainable yield (MSY). Two types of surplus production-harvest models of water hyacinth are constructed to manage the water quality of rivers in both rainy and dry seasons. The models are expected to be a simple but adequate tool of pollution control for diffuse sources in the long term. The case study with Tha-chin River in Thailand shows that effective nutrient removal can be achieved under biomass control by harvesting at MSY. Nutrient removal in the rainy season is also investigated taking into account the quantity of biomass that flows in and out of the river basin. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Conventional cointegration tests fail to consider information across countries, which leads to efficiency loss in estimation. In this article we apply panel cointegration tests to examine the cointegration between exports and imports among the G7. Our findings support the sustainability of current accounts among major industrial countries, which lends support to the intertemporal approach to the current account. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science BN.

TI Citizens' juries: an aid to environmental valuation?
SO ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING C-GOVERNMENT AND POLICY
LA English
DT Article
ID RESOURCE
AB Survey techniques such as contingent valuation have been used extensively by environmental economists to develop an understanding of consumer preferences for environmental goods. On the basis of such techniques, recommendations have been formulated in relation to environmental policy. However, the exposure of weaknesses in this method has led economists to look to other information-gathering approaches which might enhance, and/or complement, environmental valuation. One such approach is that of 'citizens' juries' (CJs). A CJ consists of a small group of people, selected to represent the general public rather than any interest group or sector, which meets to deliberate upon a policy question. This approach may complement traditional approaches to data gathering on public preferences for environmental goods and services by addressing some of the concerns that have been voiced regarding existing methods. First, CJs may be useful in tackling the problem of information provision, and concerns relating to the level of understanding of the respondent. Second, CJs may be a means of addressing the 'citizen value versus consumer value' argument in environmental valuation. Third, CJs may help researchers understand how participants construct their values. Fourth, this approach allows sustainability issues to be addressed explicitly. The authors also discuss a number of problems associated with CJs and conclude with examples from two recent juries on environmental issues which were held in Scotland, and make recommendations on how environmental economists might utilise this tool.

AB This paper explores how theoretical, practical and political issues are addressed differently by cost-benefit analysis and deliberative-participatory approaches to environmental policy. Theoretically rigorous approaches may prove to be too narrowly defined and so unsuitable because they neglect the requirements of practical implementation. Yet pragmatism which flaunts theoretical understanding lacks analytical power and can mislead policy. How economic methods, such as contingent valuation, compare with those from political science, such as citizens' juries, is an open question which we attempt to address. In addition, the new hybrid approach of deliberative monetary valuation is critically reviewed. A comparison of these approaches is made which draws out the difficulties of developing practical policy tools which are theoretically grounded and avoid political manipulation.

AB Soil water conservation is essential to the sustainability of sandy farming. In this paper, longterm observation of soil water, dry soil thickness and soil chemical changes are evaluated at eight locations in sandy soil. This paper subdivides the sandy lands and deserts of China into three climate zones: and (hyperarid and extremely arid), semiarid, and humid (subhumid and subtropical humid), with respect to the bioclimatic zone, aridity, soil water content, and soil chemical characteristics. The water movement conditions, and chemical variations in each zone are analyzed. The paper also estimates the spatial and temporal correlation function of and soil thickness and soil moisture. Sandy soils organic matter content, CaCO3 content, soluble salts content are investigated. Afforestation and selection of tree species in different sandy areas are suggested to regulate sandy land soil moisture. Sandy land in China can be divided into the four sand stabilization regions according to the shifting sand conditions and the techniques advanced: regions I, II, III, and IV. These results have important implications for remote sensing of soil moisture and soil organic carbon, and soil moisture parameterization in climate models.

AB India is fast finding its place in the industrialized world and that is beginning to raise its environmental consciousness. The Delphi technique was used to prioritize specific needs and articulate a sustainable urban improvement strategy for the city of Mumbai (formerly Bombay). The Delphi technique is a means of achieving consensual validity among raters by providing them feedback regarding other raters' responses. Mumbai has several indigenous environmental groups that were tapped for activists and leaders; the study was conducted using ten environmentalists. In the initial phases the responses resulted in a range of possible program alternatives. The last two stages helped to seek out information that generated a consensus on the part of the respondent group. Statistical analysis methods included a hierarchical cluster analysis, mean, median, mode, and percent of agreement calculations using SPSS software. The face-to-face discussion in phase 4 clarified some issues and helped the group as a whole to outline the strategy for putting in place the essential elements of a framework to improve the quality of life in an urban environment.

ID DYNAMICS
AB The objective of this study is to analyze the scope for expanding the artisanal fishery in Zanzibar and to present cointegration as an econometric method to estimate the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) in fishery. For that purpose the Schaefer and Fox surplus production models are considered. Application of cointegration is discussed to test whether there is a tendency to long run equilibrium between catch and effort as assumed by the surplus production models and implied by the MSY concept. Moreover, estimation of the parameters is dealth with. Application to data relating to artisanal fishery in Zanzibar shows that there is support for a Fox model. Moreover, we find that the current catch is only about 40 percent of the estimated MSY, but the prevalent effort is about two times bigger than the estimated optimum effort. It appears therefore that the fishery in Zanzibar is biologically overfished.

AB Examining the concepts of 'security' and 'sustainability', as they are employed in contemporary environmental discourses, the paper argues that, although the importance of the environment has been increasingly acknowledged since the 1970s, there has been a failure to incorporate other discourses surrounding 'nature'. The implications of the 'new genetics', prompted by research into recombinant DNA, suggest that future approaches to sustainability need to be more cognisant of changes in 'our' nature, as well as those of 'external' nature, the environment. This broadening of the compass of 'security' and 'sustainability' discourses would help provide greater insight into human security, from an environmental perspective.

ID NATURAL-RESOURCE SCARCITY; LAW RELEVANT
AB The present paper is a survey of the economics of survival, a branch of ecological economics that stresses the preservation of the opportunities of future generations over an extended time horizon. It outlines the main analytical foundation of the branch - in which the concept of entropy is a major building block -, and its analysis of the interaction between the economic system and the environment. Regarding its outlook of the future, we see that the founders of the branch were mainly concerned with the consequences of a serious depletion of natural resources - particularly the energetic capital of the earth. More recently, however, emphasis is being placed on problems that stem from the fragility of the global ecosystem in face of the disturbances caused by the entropic acceleration imposed by mankind. It is feared that the ongoing expansion of the scale of the economy may bring about irreversible damages to vital environmental functions, such as protection against undesirable consequences of solar radiation, maintenance of temperature within a range that will support life, and preservation of ecosystem resiliency.

AB Blue crab (Callinectes sapidus) plays an important ecological and economic role in estuaries from South America to New England. It supports a large commercial fishery in the United States with approximately one third of the landings taken from Chesapeake Bay. I developed a stage-based matrix model of the blue crab population to address three key questions: What is the ability of blue crab populations to support sustainable exploitation? What stages of the life cycle are most important in regulating the dynamics of the population? And specific to the Chesapeake Bay, what is the importance of a winter dredge fishery in determining long-term sustainability of the crab population? The model indicated that with the current pattern of exploitation blue crab populations are able to sustain a total instantaneous mortality rate (Z) similar to 0.7. If the natural mortality rate is estimated for a maximum life expectancy of 8 yr, this translates to moderate levels of exploitation (F<0.32). This value is less than the current estimate of exploitation in Chesapeake Bay (0.9-1.1) indicating that the level of exploitation in this system needs to be reduced to avoid overfishing. Transitions to and from small age-1 crabs were shown to be important in regulating the overall dynamics of the population. The egg production realized by large adults was also shown to be an important regulatory process. The model indicated that reductions in the winter dredge fishery would have a substantial role in ensuring the long-term sustainability of the population. Reductions in other sectors of the fishery are also required to ensure sustainability.

AB The French fisheries management regime is based on public and private ownership of fishing waters associated with a complex multilevel management system. A total of 730 operational commercial inland fisheries were examined by analysis of thematic interviews and questionnaires. Commercial fishermen are beginning to understand the nature of their own activity and its relationship to the concept of sustainable management. Nevertheless, fishermen have to face two major problems: first, they are poorly represented on decision making bodies where anglers are dominant, and secondly their activities are governed by two separate ministries. Opportunities for future development may lie in decision making at the catchment level.

AB The Danube Delta was designated a Biosphere Reserve in 1990. Subsequently the sustainable use of the fish stocks within the reserve became a challenge for management. The fisheries exploit a variety of habitats distributed over about 580 000 ha of wetland. They yield between 5000 and 10 000 t year(-1), equivalent in value to 6.3 million US$, making this one of the most important inland fisheries in Europe. Approximately 15 000 inhabitants within the Delta and a further 160 000 from adjacent regions depend fully or partly on the fishery resource. The fisheries are diverse, consisting of lake, river, marine coastal and anadromous fisheries. Fisheries in the Delta operated under an open access system during the transition from a fully controlled state economy to a market economy. New fishing regulations have been established to minimise the risk of the fisheries collapsing as a result of the open access regime. Core regulations including close seasons and closed areas, minimum mesh sizes and fish lengths, output controls (catch quota), and input regulations (limited access to fishery) were introduced.

AB Fish cage farming generates large amounts of organic waste in the form of unconsumed feed and fecal matter, resulting in sediment deterioration and a threat to its own sustainability. Field studies analysed the scale of the impact of fish cage farming on sediment quality, variability of impact and spread of sediment enrichment in the vicinity of a fish farm. Two fish culture sites near the Fukuyama area of the Seto Inland Sea of Japan were chosen for the study. There was a significant difference between the quality of the sediment in aquaculture and non-aquaculture areas. The sediment underlying the fish cage farms was found to be extremely reducing, acidic and sulfidic. Sediment ignition loss did not vary markedly with the season. However, the redox potential and acid volatile sulfide content of aquaculture areas did show some seasonal variation. Sediment encircling a 165 m radius from the center of a farm in Yokota was judged as organically enriched by fish farming. A variation in sediment quality within the two sites and also within the stations was observed. Based on sediment quality, the stations could be categorized as less affected, highly affected or moderately affected.

DT Article
AB Biotechnology is gaining in importance worldwide. Some see it as an important means for increased agricultural productivity medical applications and environmental remediation, advocating its use as an important tool to avert world hunger and support sustainable development in the South (eg Borlaug 1997, Wambugu 1999, Monsanto 2000). At the same time, few technologies have evoked so much controversy and public opposition, bringing together those concerned about the environment, human health and economic dominance of multinational corporations (eg FoE 1999, Nuffield Council 1999, Phelps 1999, Krebs 2000). This controversy is accompanied by a high level of scientific uncertainty regarding possible environmental and health impacts that make a decision for or against biotechnology unlikely in the near future.
   The following research note focuses on possible health impacts associated with the consumption of genetically modified (GM) food products. After a brief evaluation of possible health risks, an assessment of public opinion on GM food in Australia is presented, based on the results of a survey designed to investigate these issues.

AB Adoption and implementation of sustainable forestry practices are essential for sustaining forest resources, yet development of effective policies and strategies to achieve them are problematic. Part of the difficulty stems from a limited understanding of the interaction between obtrusive; forest policies and indigenous tenure systems and how this affects sustainable forest management. This study uses a market framework to analyze the relationships between individual components of forest tenure and sustainable forestry practices. Data from 21 rural communities in the forest belt of Ghana are used to evaluate theoretical propositions. Logistic regression models are used to predict willingness to engage in the preservation of indigenous, economically valuable trees, conservation of natural forests, and establishment of forest plantations. The number of farmers engaged in sustainable forestry practices is small. While most tenure variables behaved as expected, security of tenure and exclusiveness are less important to the practice of sustainable forestry. Farmers, in their role as potential producers, perceive preservation of indigenous, economically valuable trees and conservation of forests as having a net cost to them, especially if compensation is not paid for damage to crops resulting from logging operations of concessionaires. Current statutes in Ghana provide few incentives for farmers to engage in sustainable practices. The study also provides recommendations for forest tenure systems to function effectively.

AB IL-10 is overexpressed in human chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and is an autocrine growth factor involved in the development of malignant B1 clones in NZB mice, a murine model for CLL. Antisense IL-10 oligonucleotide treatment induces apoptosis and cell cycle disruption in these cells both in vitro and in vivo, In addition, NZB IL-10 knock-out mice fail to develop the B-1 clones. Dampening of IL-10 protein production via antisense IL-10 oligonucleotide treatment is correlated with decreased p27/Kip1 protein expression which results in increased cyclin D2, cyclin E and cyclin A associated kinase activity, The action of the antisense oligonucleotides is through alterations in cell cycle regulation, resulting in accelerated cell cycle progression, a G2/M block which culminates in apoptosis induction in the malignant cells. This implies that the role of IL-10 as an autocrine growth factor in malignant B-1 cells lies in its ability to inhibit apoptosis induction through the maintenance of sustainable cell cycle progression in malignant cells.

AB What happens when global institutions try to assist community conservation in some of the world's least industrialised areas? Among the 'cutting edge' projects grant-aided by the Global Environment Facility (GEF, a World Bank-hosted fund for 'global environmental benefits') are 'CAMPFIRE' - the Communal Areas Management Programme For Indigenous Resources - in Zimbabwe, and 'India Ecodevelopment'. Both are intended to combine protection of biodiverse wildlife with participatory rural development for impoverished local communities. We explore the 'ground truths' of these projects in two historical and political contexts. We ask whether aspiring managers of 'global resources' can sufficiently transcend ongoing tensions in 'local political ecology', while diverse value systems and experiences remain distant. We conclude with thoughts about the 'sustainable development' of foreign missions old and new. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; DROUGHT; CRISIS
AB After a century of massive transformation of surface and groundwater resources for agricultural, industrial, and urban development, water policy in Spain seems to be reaching a turning point. The National Water Plan (NWP) of 1993, insisting on the postulates of what we call the "hydraulic paradigm", envisaged the development of further hydraulic infrastructure, particularly a very ambitious system of long distance water transfers between water rich and water poor basins. The plan, however, generated strong territorial and social opposition, suffered several modifications, and has yet to be approved by the Spanish Parliament. We argue that the reasons behind the failure of the plan lie in structural trends ill suited to the plan philosophy of "water for everybody at no cost", in the new political organization of the state in which regions play a more dominant role, and, to a lesser extent, in environmental pressures. We attempt to illustrate this argument examining how the three key dimensions in the debate, regional, economic, and environmental, have affected the original plan. These dimensions, however, may be also at odds with each other and lead towards a fragmented water policy for the future more prone to social and political turmoil after the relative stability of the hydraulic era.

ID LEVEL DATA; AGASSIZ; CALIBRATION; INTERIOR; HISTORY
AB New findings of paleoenvironmental change in Lake Winnipeg, southern Manitoba, reveal evidence of unexpectedly dry conditions from 7.5 to 4 ka (7500 to 4000 radiocarbon years before present), with reduced lake area in the north and a desiccated lake basin in the south. Changes in extent of this large lake, now similar to 400 km long, can be explained by a combination of (1) expansion due to postglacial differential uplift (tilting), and (2) lake-area reduction due to drier climates associated with the former presence of dry-grassland vegetation. Comparing lake areas sustainable by grassland climate with computed potential lake areas based on the assumption of open (overflowing) conditions, we quantify the atmospheric moisture reduction represented by the middle Holocene dry conditions. This approach holds promise for calibrating regional models of climate change and exploring the effects of dry paleoclimates in other large lake basins such as the Laurentian Great Lakes. The ongoing postglacial tilting is of societal concern because it contributes to long-term lakeshore erosion and to the decrease in discharge capacity of the inflowing flood-prone Red River in a populated region.

AB The Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say), is the most serious insect pest of potatoes throughout the eastern and north central United States. Host plant resistance to the Colorado potato beetle has been identified in wild Solarium species and Bt-transgenic potato lines. Detached-leaf bioassays (72 h) were conducted on insecticide-resistant, first instar Colorado potato beetles to study the effectiveness of individual and combined host plant resistance traits in potato. Potato lines tested include non-transgenic cultivars ('Russet Burbank', 'Lemhi Russet', and 'Spunta'), a line with glandular trichomes (NYL235-4), a line with high foliar leptines (USDA8380-1), and transgenic lines expressing either codon-modified Bt-cry3A or Bt-cry5 (Bt-cry1Ia1). Bt-cry3A transgenic lines, foliar leptine line, and foliar leptine lines with Bt-cry5 had reduced feeding compared to non-transgenic cultivars. Glandular trichome lines and glandular trichome lines with Bt-cry5 did not reduce feeding in this no-choice feeding study. Some Bt-cry5 transgenic lines, using either the constitutive promoters CaMV35s or (ocs)(3)mas (Gelvin super promoter), were moderately effective in reducing larval feeding. Feeding on Bt-cry5 transgenic lines with the tuber-specific patatin promoter was not significantly different than or greater than feeding on the susceptible cultivars. Mortality of first instars was highest when fed on the Bt-cry3A lines (68% to 70%) and intermediate (38%) on the Bt-cry5 'Spunta' line SPG3 where the gus reporter gene was not included in the gene construct. Host plant resistance from foliar leptines is a candidate mechanism to pyramid with either Bt-cry3A or Bt-cry5 expression in potato foliage against Colorado potato beetle. Without multiple sources of host plant resistance, long-term sustainability is questionable for a highly adaptable insect like the Colorado potato beetle.

AB The skin offers a tissue site accessible for delivery of gene-based therapeutics. To develop the capability for sustained systemic polypeptide delivery via cutaneous gene transfer, we generated and injected pseudotyped HIV-1 lentiviral vectors intradermally at a range of doses into human skin grafted on immune-deficient mice. Unlike Moloney murine leukemia virus (MLV)-based retrovectors, which failed to achieve detectable cutaneous gene transfer by this approach, lentivectors effectively targeted all major cell types within human skin tissue, including fibroblasts, endothelial cells, keratinocytes, and macrophages. After a single injection, lentivectors encoding human erythropoietin (EPO) produced dose-dependent increases in serum human EPO levels and hematocrit that increased rapidly within one month and remained stable subsequently. Delivered gene expression was confined locally at the injection site. Excision of engineered skin led to rapid and complete loss of human EPO in the bloodstream, confirming that systemic EPO delivery was entirely due to lentiviral targeting of cells within skin rather than via spread of the injected vector to visceral tissues. These findings indicate that the skin can sustain dosed systemic delivery of therapeutic polypeptides via direct lentivector injection and thus provide an accessible and reversible approach for gene-based delivery to the bloodstream.

SO INTERCIENCIA
LA Spanish
DT Article
ID METHODOLOGY
AB With the environmental crisis in the last decades appears the directive image of a sustainable development or the sustainability in its ecological, economic and social dimensions. From the ecological perspective some characteristics and processes are fundamental for the analysis: the systemic character and complexity of the ecosystems, the myth of a stable ecological equilibrium, resiliency and irreversibility, the intrinsic sustainability of ecosystems and the phenomena of global and regional concentration and dispersion of resources and wastes. The paradigm of sustainablity can be grouped in three interpretative models: (1) under an analytical vision, (2) a holistic vision and (3) a nonnative model. The first approach results in the principle of rational resource management with its respective indicators of cause-state-effect-reaction. The holistic vision, considering the intrinsic uncertainty of ecosystems, results in the principle of precaution in resource management and defines indicators like the carrying capacity. Whilst the nonnative model tries to define objectives and indicators in a complex management situation through a consensus process involving the affected and interested groups. It is possible to identify pathways of unsustainability and sustainability. The environmental sciences provide monitoring instruments, but finally, due to its nonnative character; sustainability is a policy objective and therefore is part of a responsibility ethic.

AB For the first time we used amplified fragment length polymorphism oil individual nematode parasites to analyse the genetic diversity between and within isolates during consecutive stages of increased benzimidazole resistance and of increased levamisole resistance of Haemonchus contortus. The genetic diversity of the H. contortus genome turned out to be unusually high, within and between the isolates. The difference between individuals of an isolate could be as high as between individuals of two different mammalian species that do not interbreed. During benzimidazole selection the genetic constitution of the population was changed, but did not lead to a decrease in the genetic diversity. The selection for levamisole resistance resulted in a limited reduction of the genetic diversity only after the first selection step. The extensive genetic diversity apparently has allowed a fast and flexible response of H. contortus to drug selection as shown by the appearance of drug resistant isolates. This selection however has little or no effect oil the extent of the genetic diversity of these resistant isolates. Implications for more sustainable control methods are discussed.

AB Objective. As the cost and degree of training necessary to provide state of the art health care has increased throughout the world, the present challenge in health care is to establish institutions that are financially sound and responsive to the dynamic needs of the communities in which they exist. As public funds have diminished, the role of the private sector in establishing innovative health care institutions has increased.
   Setting and study participants. This paper reviews the case of the LV Prasad Eye Institute (LVPEI), an ophthalmologic institute in Hyderabad, India, that is financially sound and medically vital. With an annual budget of US$3 Million, 180 000 patients are seen and 23 000 surgeries are performed at the Institute and its satellites each year.
   Main Measures. The Institute provides patient care at a ratio of 1:1 non-paying to paying patients through fee cross-subsidization. The Institute uses a combination of financial modalities, including donations, grants and fees to administer its non-patient care programs. Non-clinical programs of the Institute include a paramedical training program and a fellowship in ophthalmology, an internationally accredited eye bank for the preservation of corneal tissues, a rural out-reach and education program, a basic science and epidemiology program that directs health policy activities of the Institute and a rehabilitation program for patients with incurable visual deficits. To evaluate its effectiveness, LVPEI uses quality improvement measures, including patient surveys, post-operative outcomes studies and service utilization reviews.
   Conclusion. This case report of a privately-funded medical institution describes a successful model through which high-quality, equitable health care can be provided in a developing country. The LVPEI's active program of quality management, its academic commitment and programmatic relevance to the needs of its community should be modularized and replicated to establish equitable, efficient and effective health care institutions in the developing world.

AB In recent years Central Amazonia has experienced considerable effort to establish sustainably managed plantation systems. In the much favoured polyculture systems trees producing high quality timber are also considered to some extent. True mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla King) and the closely related Andiroba (Carapa guianenis Aubl.) are especially attractive in this respect. However, little is known about their ecological adaptation strategies, in particular with regard to the tine root system. In this study the anatomical structure and chemical characteristics of the fine roots of these two species were investigated and special strategies to resist drought periods are demonstrated. Especially the exodermis develops cells well adapted to drought. Carapa guianensis produces cells with a distinct suberin layer and thick "U-shaped" secondary walls as well as "pad" cells which seem to direct the influx/efflux of water and nutrients. On the other hand, Swietenia macrophylla produces only very moderate "U-shaped" exodermis cells with a delicate suberin layer and also thin-walled "passage" cells without suberin. All other tissues of the Fine roots do not differ significantly between the two species. Both store reserve protein bodies in the large central vacuole of the cortex cells to sustain prolonged drought. In general, the special fine root system of Carapa guianensis appears better adapted to drought than that of Swietenia macrophylla.

TI Colonization of fine roots of mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla King) by
   vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi under plantation conditions in
   Central Amazon
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED BOTANY-ANGEWANDTE BOTANIK
LA English
DT Article
ID DROUGHT TOLERANCE
AB Mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla King) is one of the most important commercial tree species in tropical Northern Brazil and its timber is highly valued world-wide. Due to the massive exploitation in the past decades, however, mahogany supplies have diminished to the point that the Brazilian government has recently ordered a complete harvesting stop. To counter the threat to its survival, intensive efforts were started in the past years to study fundamentals for sustainable management plantations of this species.
   In this context, the colonization of the fine roots by mycorrhizal fungi in plantation trees and seedlings raised in nurseries is of great importance for sustainable growth. In order to study the environmental requirements of mahogany, experimental plantations were established 1991 to 1993 on the poor latosol sites of the "terra firme" near Manaus/Amazon. Without exception, mycorrhiza developed intensively under plantation conditions and also in the 20-month-old seedlings cultivated under controlled conditions.
   Mycorrhizal structures of the Arum-type vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhiza (VAM) were found, with appressoria penetration and coiled hyphae, vesicles and arbuscules. The colonization of the fine roots with mycorrhizal fungi was restricted to the root zone with an active rhizodermis where suberization and a U-shaped secondary wall including lignification of the exodermis was not yet developed. From the secondary stage of the exodermis onwards the uptake of water and mineral elements is maintained by specialized passage cells. This adaptation strategy to the specific conditions of a dry season is seen as a characteristic feature of the fine roots of Swietenia macrophylla.
   Considering also the results of parallel investigations on the fine root structure, the water and mineral element cycling, and photosynthesis, mahogany can be recommended for sustainable production of high-quality timber under plantation conditions.

AB 1. Reliable data on the growth and yield of logged-over forest, to determine sustainable cutting cycles, are widely missing for the tropics.
   2. We used the process-based model FORMIND2.0 to analyse the growth and yield of logged-over forest in Venezuela under different logging scenarios over a period of 240 years, and compared results with unlogged stands. The performance of the model was evaluated with a detailed stability and sensitivity analysis.
   3. In the absence of further logging, the logged-over stand approached the stand structure of mature forest in terms of bole volume and basal area after about 50-100 years.
   4. Thirty-year cutting cycles with conventional logging methods and net extraction volumes of 45 and 60 m(3) ha(-1) cycle(-1) did not provide sustainable yields under either of two minimum felling diameters (35 and 50 cm) that were applied. Only the 60-year cutting cycle provided sustainable yields under conventional and reduced-impact logging, with the different minimum felling diameters and a range of net volumes extracted (30-60 m(3) ha(-1) cycle(-1)).
   5. With the longest cutting cycle (60 years), bole volume recovered to levels similar to the mature unlogged stand, but the species composition was very different.
   6. Scenarios with reduced-impact logging provided a significantly higher timber volume than under conventional logging. The conservation of forest resources will only be possible with long cutting cycles (at least 60 years) in combination with reduced-impact logging.

AB Regulation to minimize impacts from aquaculture is of key concern in coastal zone management for the sustainability of the industry and the receiving environment. Market and consumer forces are presently driving much of this regulation and its implementation, Mathematical modelling can provide the tools for planning and monitoring as well as regulation, and a number of countries have well-developed policies and procedures in place which utilize modelling tools. The main impacts currently modelled are nutrient enhancement, organic waste deposition and the dispersion and deposition of medicines and chemicals. The release of these wastes is influenced by species- and site-specific characteristics, as well as culture and husbandry techniques. The modelling process requires consideration of definitions and limitations; standards for model development including clear objectives and justification; good technical descriptions use of good and appropriate data; calibration; validation; sensitivity analysis; quality assurance; auditability and consideration of the operational needs of the user, the grower and/or the regulator. Models should have simplicity and clarity; be fit for purpose, be open to scrutiny; be accessible, user-friendly and be used with caution. Current models are considered to be limited in scope but do cover the main hydrodynamic and particulate processes. The regulation and monitoring of finfish aquaculture involving the direct use of models is apparently restricted to relatively few countries where they are involved in setting holding capacity, the licensing of medicines and for assessing site applications. Different approaches have been developed in different countries as required. In contrast, many countries do make considerable indirect use of modelling techniques within the regulation process. With respect to shellfish, models are in current use to predict and optimize exploitation capacity but there is scope for studying nutrient flux, habitat degradation and deposition below suspended systems. Future developments for finfish need to better address the main question of holding capacity or exploitation capacity in relation to nutrients and medicines release, including whole water body/regional impacts. The relationship and predictability of toxic algal blooms remains some way off. Modelling the complexities of degradation, resuspension and the effect of the scavenging process on the transport of in-feed medicines is required. Keys to future developments across Europe include accessibility, setting of Environmental Quality Standards or targets, training and support for users, resources and structured research.

AB This paper provides a critical review of the main issues regarding the scientific principles underlying environmental monitoring of marine aquaculture operations and makes recommendations relevant to the implementation of best practice for the management of aquaculture in Europe. Given that a variety of cultured species and approaches are adopted in Europe, it is not possible, or indeed desirable, to devise prescriptive guidelines. Instead, this paper reviews how science informs monitoring and provides a framework for the development of a monitoring strategy of marine aquaculture operations that is flexible enough to be applicable to a variety of locations, species and situations.
   Traditionally environmental monitoring has concentrated on a few key physical and chemical variables and organisms. The trend now, however, is towards whole-system environmental assessment (e.g. CEC 2000; Osparcom 1998), including considerations of the assimilative capacity of specific systems and their ability to absorb and dilute perturbations. Against this background this paper addresses the following specific objectives:
   review of the rationale and scientific principles underlying current environmental monitoring with specific reference to marine aquaculture;
   evaluation of the links between monitoring and regulatory criteria, specifically consideration of environmental quality objectives and environmental quality standards, and the role of environmental impact assessments
   assessment of the role of codes of best conduct and practice, and environmental management systems in the management of aquaculture operations.
   The paper concludes by proposing a set of recommendations which will contribute towards the sustainable management of aquaculture operations, through the implementation of a more focused approach to environmental monitoring.

CY AUG 28-31, 2000

AB This paper presents a critical review of current social, economic and policy issues relevant to marine aquaculture (mariculture) in Europe. Tools for identifying the full range of social, economic and environmental issues that influence the sustainable development of mariculture are examined. Under present sectoral approaches to policy, investment, development planning and natural resources management, these issues continue to be treated in isolation. The four main challenges presented in this paper are: (i) how to create a more objective information base with which to assess the social, economic and environmental factors that condition the sustainability of mariculture; (ii) how to provide information from different disciplines in an easy to obtain and compatible format; (iii) how to better integrate knowledge and skills from different disciplines to create a holistic and robust framework for assessing options for mariculture development that integrates social, economic and environmental parameters; and (iv) the effective integration of these assessments into the formulation of policy, investment strategies, spatial plans and natural resources management for coastal areas.
   Specific issues that need to be addressed within the framework for the integrated evaluation of the economic, social and environmental parameters governing the sustainable development of mariculture include:
   development of more accurate information on the economic, social and environmental benefits and costs of well-planned and managed mariculture;
   clearer definition of gaps in existing knowledge on factors critical to the sustainable and equitable development of mariculture;
   development of pro-active consideration of the coastal land and water resource requirements of mariculture as part of strategic economic planning, spatial planning and natural resources management;
   the need for more equitable treatment of mariculture regarding rights of access to sites for development and use of resources;
   development of awareness among decision-makers, planners, and managers from different sectoral agencies of the contribution that mariculture may make in promoting the sustainable use of coastal ecosystems;
   promotion of a shift in emphasis away from controlling the end use of resources and toward a more balanced approach to coastal development where emphasis is also given to maintaining the health and productivity of coastal ecosystems and the resources they generate that sustain different forms of activity, including mariculture.

AB The objectives of the paper were to identify, barriers to community participation in road safety activities and to recommend strategies to reduce those barriers. Information was obtained from: a review of relevant literature, from the authors' extensive community-based experiences, from undertaking community-based research, and from interviews with key stakeholders in road safety in Western Australia. Ten significant barriers to community participation were identified. These are classified into two groups: personnel and planning issues. The former includes: reasons why people are often reluctant to become involved in projects in their communities, a lack of leadership, and a lack of skills. The latter includes: inappropriate program foci, inappropriate program evaluation, lack of resources, and a lack of sustainability. It was concluded that the barriers to community involvement in road safety initiatives are similar in many parts of Australia and overseas and apply to a wide range of health promotion interventions besides road safety. Awareness of the barriers and knowledge of their solutions can ensure that appropriate steps are taken to maximise the likelihood of community participation.

AB The presence of Whitethroats and their potential invertebrate prey in farmland trees and shrubs was investigated. The management of this vegetation by farmers, and their motivation for that management, was explored using participatory techniques. Whitethroats were associated with Guiera senegalensis, the shrub species which supports most caterpillars and spiders. Farmers reported declines in trees and shrubs since the 1950s, loss of fallow areas, declines in soil fertility and crop yields, and increases in the use of fire for clearing fields. Trees are valued by people for their cultural and medicinal uses and some species used by Whitethroais and other birds have potential for restoring soil fertility, although this was not recognised by farmers. More sustainable use of savanna farmland could have both agronomic and wider conservation benefits, and the provision of information that accommodates farmers' cultural and economic incentives could benefit both farmers and wildlife.

SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT

   consumption; scenario; Laos
AB In developing countries, planning in the forestry sector has been seen as an appropriate instrument to prepare and implement government policies and programs. Despite its potential and recent advancements in, for example, remote sensing and infrastructure, tropical forest land-use planning is often formal and non-integrated with agriculture. It rarely involves all legitimate stakeholders and neglects taking into account actual land-use. The socio-economic and environmental consequences of these shortcomings emphasise the need for alternative ways of approaching planning. This article summarises the idea, structure and current status of the Area Production Model (APM), originally developed in the 1980s, which is now gaining interest as a land-use planning tool in Africa and Asia. It describes the development over time of production and consumption in agriculture and forestry within a defined geographical area operating under different assumptions on management, land use and socio-economic and macro-economic changes. From a narrow perspective, the APM is a fairly simple computerised tool for generating scenarios. In a broad sense, it is a concept comprising the whole planning process including organisation, inventory, data analysis, consensus building and strategy. A case-study in Lacs, based on verified data for a historical period of 45 years, and a review of different APM applications in the world over the last 15 years are presented as a base for conclusions about its potential and shortcomings. in some cases where the APM concept was used in training courses and planning exercises involving stakeholders, it generated a strong interest in collecting and analysing relevant information. It provides the means of addressing a number of shortcomings in current planning. (C) 2001 Academic Press.

AB We examine how forest certification can be used more effectively to produce concrete conservation results on forests that have been designated for timber production, by limiting forest fragmentation (thereby improving forest intactness over a landscape scale), and by conserving structural diversity, wildlife habitats, late successional components, natural disturbance regimes, and other components of biodiversity. We conclude that forest certification, as an integrative tool to be used in silvicultural management processes, can play an important role in promoting the sustainability of managed forests and of forestry.

AB Product innovation is increasingly valued as a key component of the sustainable success of a business's operations. As a result, there has been a noticeable increase in the number of studies directed at explicating the drivers of new product success. To help managers and researchers synthesize this growing body of evidence, the authors conduct a meta-analysis of the new product performance literature. Of the 24 predictors of new product performance investigated, product advantage, market potential, meeting customer needs, predevelopment task proficiencies, and dedicated resources, on average, have the most significant impact on new product performance. The authors also find that the predictor-performance relationships can vary by measurement factor (e.g., the use of multi-item scales, subjective versus objective measures of performance, senior versus project management reporting, time elapsed since product introduction) or contextual factor (e.g., services versus goods, Asian versus North American markets, competition in high-technology versus low-technology markets). They discuss the implications of these findings and offer directions for further research.

DE resource allocation; physician-patient relationship; cost-effectiveness
ID HEALTH
AB Physicians have an ethical responsibility to their patients to offer the best available medical care. This responsibility conflicts with their role as gatekeepers of the limited health care resources available for all patients collectively. It is ethically untenable to expect doctors to face this trade-off during each patient encounter; the physician cannot be expected to compromise the wellbeing of the patient in the office in favour of anonymous patients elsewhere. Hence, as in other domains of public policy where individual and collective interests conflict, some form of collective solution is required. Collective solutions may take the form of placing explicit resource constraints on resources available to physicians, or clinical practice guidelines that recognise cost-effective care as acceptable. Such solutions will be politically and ethically sustainable only if patients as citizens of the larger population accept the need for rationing of limited resources in health care.

AB This paper examines how alteration of soils by tillage changes the sustainability of soil functions. Soil tillage presents an enigma in thinking about soil sustainability in ecosystems. There is a several thousand-year history of gradually increasing the disturbance of ever-greater volumes of soil. The dominant concept was that these changes by tillage increased crop production. We now have a several-decade concern with decreasing tillage, both for reasons of economy and sustainability. Have soil conditions changed, or do we now know more about soil science and its application to crop production?
   Specific soil uses, specific soils, characteristics of the site, and whether short or long-term changes are being evaluated determine the effects of tillage in agro-ecosystems. The largest effects of tillage are increased recycling rates and long-term decreases in porosity and in diversity of habitat. The benefits of tillage in annual crop production appear to be a temporary improvement of water and oxygen conditions in a seedbed, and the destruction of competing plant species. Environmental concerns such as water quality, diversity of habitat, storage of carbon and nitrogen, and water partitioning are negatively affected by tillage.

AB A novel blend system was prepared by blending organosoluble nitro-substituted polybenzimidazole (NO2-PBI) and polyetherimide (PEI) in a cosolvent at a moderate condition. It was shown that the NO2-PBI/PEI blends not only possess tractable processability owing to the enhanced solubility of NO2-PBI but also retain the desirable features of unmodified PBI/PEI blends. Apparent miscibility in the blends was observed and attributed to hydrogen-bonding interactions between N-H groups in NO2-PBI and carbonyl groups in PEI. It was revealed that the NO2-PBI/PEI blends phase-separate upon heating above the glass-transition temperatures. The observed mixing of NO2-PBI and PEI in a molecular level, although sustainable only in the glassy region, was shown to lend synergy effects to the physical properties of the blends.

AB PURPOSE: To conduct a feasibility study to assess the feasibility, safety, and outcome of endoluminal gamma radiation therapy after balloon angioplasty of superficial femoral artery (SFA) lesions.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty patients with claudication were enrolled in the study and underwent percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) of SFA lesions with a mean lesion length of 9.8 cm +/- 3.0 and a mean reference vessel diameter of 5.2 mm +/- 3.1. After successful PTA, a segmented centering balloon catheter was positioned to cover the PTA site. The patients were then transported to the radiation oncology suite and treated with a microSelectron HDR afterloader with use of an Ir-192 source with a prescribed dose of 14 Gy, 2 mm into the vessel wall. Ankle-brachial index (ABI) and Rutherford score were evaluated at 1, 6, and 12 months after the procedure and angiographic follow-up was conducted at 6 months.
   RESULTS: Radiation was delivered successfully to 35 of 40 patients. There were no procedural complications. Exercise and rest ABI were higher at 1 year (0.72 +/- 0.26 and 0.89 +/- 0.18, respectively) compared to baseline (0.51 +/- 0.25 and 0.67 +/- 0.17, respectively). Maximum walking time on a treadmill increased from 3.41 min +/- 2.41 to 4.43 min +/- 2.49 at 30 days and was 4.04 min +/- 2.8 at 12 months. The angiographic binary restenosis rate at 6 months was 17.2% and the clinical restenosis rate at 12 months was 13.3%. There were no angiographic or clinical adverse events related to the radiation therapy.
   CONCLUSIONS: Intraarterial radiation after PTA of SFA lesions with use of high-dose rate gamma radiation is feasible and safe. The angiographic and clinical improvements are sustainable at 1 year and represent a potent antirestenotic therapy for the treatment of narrowed peripheral arteries.

AB Poor water supply practices directly affect the social and economic conditions of each and every community. Since actions on water supply systems are usually at the local level, this is an area where individual citizens can become highly involved if motivated and energized with financial incentives. Community education is vitally important for sensitization and mobilization of the rural communities so as to achieve commitment and sustainability. The theme of this discussion is that water-using development projects should fulfil the real local needs for improved production, social conditions and cultural achievement. consequently, a strategic approach for managing water resources sustainably is essential to the actual planning, development and implementation of water-related development activities.

AB If current land use practices in the uplands of Central America are not modified soon, rural poverty will persist and lead to environmental collapse. There is a simultaneous need for increase of productivity, improved natural resource management, and recognition of people's rights to the resources they manage. Only when rural families can consider land to be their own, manage resources sustainably, and generate surplus will they be able to trigger genuine change in the system of governance. Top-down attempts to change the system of governance will only succeed in changing the form rather than the content. Until the governed have shaken off traditional patterns of dependency and control from above as well as modified their land use practices, the vicious circle of poverty will remain intact. The proposals for an alternative approach presented in this article are based on more than 6 years of field work in 20 municipalities in the mountains of Lempira, Honduras (Figure 1).

TI Endogenous development in Austria's mountain regions: From a source of
   irritation to a mainstream movement
SO MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Regional development in mountain areas and the impact of development on landscapes have been focuses of economic and regional policies in Austria for many decades due to the country's very mountainous topography. A special Support Program for Mountain Farmers was established in the early 1970s. Since the late 1970s, support for regional economies has been defined from a bottom-up perspective. Meanwhile, measures designed in accordance with agricultural and regional policies have become an important component of Austria's mountain policy, with significant implications for sustainable regional development. Assessment of mountain agriculture in Austria has been carried out with particular attention to ways and means of supporting the agricultural sector and to measures aiming to preserve and manage land resources sustainably under the difficult production conditions in mountains. At the core of mountain policy is the valuation of nonmarketable goods, which are increasingly referred to as "rural amenities" in international discourse (Figure 1). Such valuation must be included in comprehensive policy assessments of sustainable development. Emphasis on the character of mountain areas with respect to potential local and regional amenities has made it possible to enhance small-scale development initiatives at the local level. Sustainable resource use in peripheral mountain regions largely depends on the possible development potential of amenities in regional concepts, on nurturing the endogenous potential of the local population, and on inducing appropriate initiatives for balanced development of cultural landscapes and rural society.

DT Article
DE urbanization; periurbanization; European functional urban areas (EFUAs);
   spatial functional divisions; regional development; European Alps
AB The European Alps are among the world's most densely populated mountain regions. To date, towns have played a subordinate role within this area. Due to the marginal position of Alpine towns within national urban systems, they do not constitute an interrelated urban system, and no primary center exists. The current degree of urbanization cannot be measured by adding up the population of the towns in the Alps. Instead, it is necessary to demarcate urbanized zones according to functional criteria. This article presents a demarcation of urbanized zones in the Alps based on the French method of European functional urban areas (EFUAs). As elsewhere in Europe, urbanized zones are expanding and gaining importance under the influence of structural changes in the economy. At the same time, the shift to post-Fordist production and regulation is leading to more pronounced internationalization of medium-sized and small towns as well as conurbations. Census data on demography and commuting collected between 1960 and 1995 indicate that urbanization processes in the Alps have caught up with those occurring in non-Alpine Europe, A comparison of 1980 and 1990 data on employment shows that growth sectors in the Alps are lagging behind those in peri-Alpine conurbations. The Alpine border is gradually being turned into a residential and recreational area for these peri-Alpine conurbations. The present article argues that this externally driven functional division between urban regions outside the Alps and monofunctional recreational landscapes within the Alps contradicts the criteria of sustainable development. Hence, a policy of strengthening small and medium towns in order to increase the value of inner-Alpine lifestyles and economies and enhance town-country relations is preferable to the continued expansion of peri-Alpine agglomerations and metropolitan areas and should be encouraged within the boundaries set by ecological principles.

AB Tropical deforestation poses a threat to ecological sustainability and socioeconomic development in many parts of the world. Information on forest transformations is especially pertinent in sensitive ecological zones such as mountainous regions, where forest cover protects steep slopes and thin soils from erosion. Such areas are frequently unsuitable for agriculture, but inhabitants may have few alternatives to meet subsistence needs. Understanding the relationship between human behavior and forest change poses a major challenge for development projects, policy makers, and environmental organizations that aim to improve forest management. Knowledge of the areal extent of forest cover and the processes of change represents an integral step, but in many areas of the globe, these processes are still relatively unknown. This study addresses forest cover change in a community in the mountains of western Honduras. Between 1987 and 1996, 9.77 km(2) of land was reforested and only 7.48 km(2) was deforested, as determined by satellite image analysis. This reforestation is related to the current institutional, biophysical, and socioeconomic contexts. Forests remain primarily on steeper slopes, at higher elevations, and at a distance from settlements and roads. A county ban on logging has allowed regrowth of previously logged areas. Agricultural intensification appears related to abandonment of some marginal lands. Processes of privatization have been occurring, private forests reveal higher reforestation and lower deforestation rates than communal forests. Privatization, however, has favored the wealthy. Thus, the majority has had to depend on shrinking communal forests.

AB In ecological studies it is necessary to create new tools to describe and understand the complex mechanisms and interactions of natural systems. Different types of models have been introduced but none of them completely explains by itself the system under study, as the level of complexity involved in an ecosystem is really high. Thermodynamic models, such as emergy and exergy analyses, are holistic approaches that consider all matter and energy flows in a system and can be used to assess system efficiency, environmental impact and level of self-organization. They only account for one side of the picture: the utility of an item is evaluated only in energy terms and is considered a property of the item itself, neglecting the larger system, the biosphere, in which it is included. This is not correct because the effects of using an item (a resource, a fuel, etc.) could produce alterations to the equilibria of the biosphere. It is therefore necessary to integrate these and other models designed to assess ecological aspects and consider all the non linear mechanisms and feedbacks.
   In this paper we propose the use of thermodynamic models at macroscopic level and mathematical models at microscopic level, to study energy cycles in ecological systems. The aim of the paper is to show how different approaches, each focusing on different aspects of natural systems, are necessary in ecology.

AB The objectives of present paper are modification and investigation of the global model "World Dynamics". Here has circumscribed the modified global model, which differs from Forrester-Egorov model [1-3] (in differential form) by appearance of nonlinear differential equations for the dynamics of land biomass, technological level, ecological industry of artificial pollution purification and control of expenses for the regeneration of natural resources and ensuring safety [3], also of dependencies for world gross product and political intensity level in the world. The multivariant modeling with analysis of different scenarios of global development has been carried out. In particular, the base scenario with consideration of all noted factors and conditions, the scenarios of pollution crisis have been studied and so on. The danger of society and biosphere collapse under Forrester conditions for global equilibrium has been revealed. The conditions and scenario of sustainable development in modified global model have been found and the corresponding (limited) stationary solution has been indicated in this paper. Stability of this stationary solution under constantly acting perturbations bounded in middle [5] and it's asymptotic stability have been proved. The possibility of the global sustainable development of the world in XXI century (after 2025) has been established.

DT Article
AB The use of precision (site-specific) crop production is spreading slowly but surely throughout the world. This new technology allows a far greater data basis to be compiled and analysed, both for the crop and for its environment, thus opening up new prospects for the use of artificial (technical and geographical) and natural (biological) information systems. Present developments indicate that in 5-10 years' time biological research (e.g. gene technology) will be more important than technical and geoinformational research in this field, too.
   Precision (site-specific) crop production requires a fundamental change of attitude, since the technology can only be applied against a background of interdisciplinary cooperation involving mechanical, electrical and chemical engineers, software designers, geoinformation experts, environment experts, crop producers (including specialists in soil science, plant diseases and production technology), agricultural chemists, breeders and gene technologists, who must think and act together if economic, environmental protection (ecological) and quality benefits are to be achieved. In this way, precision (site-specific) crop production could be a basic tool in sustainable agricultural production.
   The paper not only outlines the advantages of the present system of precision (site-specific) farming, but also indicates what technical, geoinformational and biological research is necessary to achieve further improvements and what conclusions have been reached by the authors on the basis of their current research.

AB A 3-year field study examined the effects of 1,3-dichloropropene or oxamyl on tuber yields in four early- and five late-maturing potato cultivars. The nematicide treatments increased total tuber yield by approximate to 12% for early-maturing cultivars, but by less than 2% for the late-maturing cultivars. The treatments reduced the numbers of root lesion nematodes (primarily Pratylenchus penetrans), which were the dominant plant parasitic nematodes at the site. Covariance analysis indicated that treatment effects on total tuber yield were no longer significant after adjusting for root lesion nematodes in soil at harvest, confirming that these nematodes had a direct effect on the host. As expected, there were significant inverse relationships (P = 0.05) between total tuber yields and numbers of root lesion nematodes in soil and in roots. However, the application of nematicides in late-maturing cultivars was found to be of no practical value. Crop production systems designed to reduce or optimize pesticide applications can form one criterion in the development of more environmentally sensitive management strategies. The merit of utilizing chemicals for root lesion nematode control are considered with regard to cultivar maturity.

AB Driven by the twin pressures of increasing efficiency and sustainability, civil engineers are starting to move construction technology forward again after a century of relative stagnation. However, simply using stronger materials is no longer enough as these cost more to manufacture and are harder to recycle. Sustainability is the key, and designers need to look more to nature for solutions-not least the fibre-reinforced polymers which occur most frequently in nature as wood and bone. This paper reviews some of the new construction technologies and materials that may be used in the future-including a recently developed composite cellular building system and a skinned steel space frame and demonstrates that ingenuity is alive and well in construction.

AB A diverse cocktail of synthetic chemicals is now globally distributed in the environment. food web, and human tissues, posing significant health risks to humans and wildlife. The current approach to environmental regulation is inherently inadequate to address the scope and complexity of this problem, A fundamental shift in paradigm is required to protect human health and ecological systems from chemically induced damage. The concept of green chemistry represents a critical part of this shift, but it is not sufficient per se. Only if green chemistry is conceived as part of a new policy based upon precautionary, democratically guided implementation of sustainable production technologies will it contribute significantly to establishing an ecologically compatible production base.

From an environmental standpoint, the ideal focus is to achieve optimum performance across the system, not at a single systems level. This paper proposes a four-level system for green chemistry and provides examples of performance at each level that can legitimately be termed sustainable.

AB Global population and environmental pressures are challenging multinational companies to develop new business strategies founded upon the principles of sustainability-assuring that they can meet the needs of both present and future generations of customers and stakeholders. Corporate sustainability requires understanding the "triple bottom line", which includes economic, societal, and ecological performance. It involves designing products and processes with a full awareness of their life-cycle costs and benefits, and seeking new technologies to create more value with fewer resources. To put sustainability into practice, companies are beginning to transform their core business processes and develop environmentally and socially responsible products and services. Many are adopting the concepts of industrial ecology and green chemistry in an effort to transform their operations from a linear to a closed-loop business model. This changing climate is creating new opportunities for break-through research and development, ranging from nanotechnology to green chemistry.

AB Most companies have embraced the American Chemistry Council (ACC) Responsible Care(R) program, including Product Stewardship, and are integrating ISO 14001 and other environmental management systems. The Rohm and Haas Company uses environmental improvement objectives that not only focus on compliance with existing regulations and industry trends, but for developing business unit-driven objectives to reduce our environmental footprints for processes and systems. To attain the next level of strategic environmental management, integration of sustainable concepts and activities into a general management framework, new product development and corporate decision-making processes must occur. Businesses need to internalize that operating sustainably creates long-term value, achieves a greater competitive edge, and is not solely a short-term cost-reduction activity. They must recognize and foster implementation of technological advances in green chemistry, life-cycle analysis, risk assessment, and engineering consistent with specific business goals. Development of sustainability improvement objectives for each business unit assists in meeting our global sustainability goals. The process, measures and metrics, challenges, and results for integrating sustainability into the culture at Rohm and Haas will be described during this presentation.

AB The public has growing concerns about the effects of human activity on the environment for both themselves and future generations. The concept being developed to address these environmental concerns, along with economic and social-equity considerations, is called "sustainable development". The business community has already started to address their contribution to environmental issues through collaborative efforts under organizations such as the World Business Council for Sustainable Development. That work has focused primarily on industrial and corporate environmental and economic performance through the development of eco-efficiency metrics, which are a measure of resources and materials consumed per unit output of product, sales, or value-added. While this development is important, it is not enough. Clearly, the environmental performance of the entire product system must also be elucidated. Otherwise, one might forget, for example, the power plant emissions of his or her so-called "zero-emission" vehicle. The metrics required to characterize sustainable practices and systems have yet to be developed. The set will include economic, environmental. and social-equity metrics. Because of their system-oriented environmental performance representation, life-cycle assessment metrics are certainly going to be included in such a set. A discussion of some potential life-cycle metrics follows.

AB Electrochemical methods have been proposed for synthesis of organic compounds, including conversion of CO2. Such methods may provide a basis for environmentally friendly and sustainable methods for chemical production. Nevertheless, electrochemical syntheses are not widely utilized. Several examples of ongoing research are presented that illustrate both the opportunities as well as the challenges associated with the utilization of electrochemistry for green chemical manufacturing.

TI Ecological economics: themes, approaches, and differences with
   environmental economics
SO REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE
LA English
DT Article
DE Comparison; Environmental policy; Growth debate; Individual behaviour;
   International trade; Multilevel dynamics
AB This article provides a short overview of the main themes of ecological economics (EE). It is argued that EE provides a platform that fosters multidisciplinary environmental research by bringing together the core contributing disciplines - economics and ecology. In addition, EE is regarded as a pluralistic approach to environmental research that can be set opposite to, and has indeed developed as a response to, traditional environmental and resource economics. A comparison of the two fields is presented to clarify the essential differences between them. In addition, specific themes are examined in more detail. These include: sustainable development; the growth debate; international trade; dynamic processes; and behaviour and policy.

TI Sustainable management of transboundary river basins: a line of
   reasoning
SO REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE
LA English
DT Article
DE Sustainable development; River basin management; Case study; Rhine;
   Indicators; Economy-ecology
ID RHINE; ECONOMICS; ECOSYSTEM
AB This paper identifies a line of reasoning based on a number of concepts and tools to facilitate river basin management, which have been applied in a case study. For long-term sustainable river basin management, a balance is needed between the human use of the river and its basin, the ecological functioning of the river and receiving waters, and the river's capacity to supply goods and services. To find such a balance a framework is needed that illustrates and clarifies possible trade-offs between economic use and environmental supply by integrating scientific information on cause-effect chains on a catchment scale. A number of concepts and tools are proposed as a basis for this framework. The tools are: (1) indicators that describe the complex interactions and processes in rivers; (2) a suite of linked models that predict the economic, environmental and ecological effect of management measures; (3) an evaluation framework to rank different management alternatives on the basis of three objectives: economic efficiency, spatial equity in costs and benefits and environmental quality of the river and receiving lakes. The concept of environmental quality defines the potential of the river environment (i.e. natural capital) to contribute to human welfare. The concept of environmental functions is used to identify societal interest in natural capital. The concept and tools have been applied in a case study involving the evaluation of four management strategies on nutrient abatement in the Rhine basin. The result of the case study is that economic efficiency is in conflict with spatial equity and environmental quality. Spatial equity is in agreement with environmental quality.

DE animal heath; eggs; food safety; integration; poultry; poultry meat;
   public heath; traceability
AB Traceability of animals and animal products is becoming an essential marketing requirement necessary to meet heightened consumer expectations, particularly with respect to food safety. Traceability is a fundamental part of the management and audit systems that have been developed to provide assurances to the consumer.
   Most poultry products are produced by large companies who control all facets of production to an extraordinary level. The primary breeding, commercial breeding and production stages of poultry production have had to develop comprehensive recording and traceability systems, for productivity rather than public health reasons. These systems are principally documentary trails on an individual flock basis. Each flock comprises a unit having the same or similar status. Individual identification of poultry is not generally practised commercially, except in elite breeding stock. Traceability systems are being expanded in the production, processing and distribution areas to accommodate consumer concerns regarding public health and other issues.
   The nature of the industry and the level of controls applied by the poultry sector can provide sound and sustainable guarantees to the consumer. Future development lies in the wider application of sophisticated computerised systems at primary and further processing levels, to ensure that traceability can be maintained.

AB Deregulation, with concurrent pressure on electricity utilities, has fundamentally changed the once-"closed" radioactive waste management system controlled by the so-called "nuclear establishment." Advocacy coalitions may change-who knows in which direction-but policy learning may also take place. This article presents a framework to evaluate the management options for a specified concept of "sustainability." When weighing the different objectives in view of the long-lasting potential danger of radiotoxic substances, the overall goal of a sound waste management system is to demonstrate safety. The first-priority objective of a disposal system, therefore, is its stability so that it can comply with the protection goal, that is, the long-term protection of humans and the environment from ionizing radiation. The complementary objective is flexibility, defined here as intervention potential. Because trade-offs within the "sustainability triangle" of ecology, economy, and society are unavoidable, the concept of "integral robustness "-both technical and societal-is introduced into radioactive waste management. A system is robust if it is not sensitive to significant parameter changes. In the present case, it has to have a conservative, passively stable design with built-in control and intervention mechanisms. With regard to technical implementation, a concept called,'monitored long-term geological disposal" is presented. Such an "extended" final disposal concept emphasizes technical robustness, recognizes evaluation demands (for a potential break-off of a project), and enhances process-based transparency. This open approach admittedly sets high challenges with regard to technicalities as well as the institutional setting and the management process. It requires "mutual learning" by and from all stakeholders to achieve a truly sustainable radioactive waste management system.

AB As one of the largest countries in the world, China has a highest population and great potential in water resources and land. Water is a key issue for sustainable development in the future, because the average water and land availability per-capita is much lower than the world averages. Water resources assessment plays a very important role. However, certain problems could not be solved due to lack of hydrological data, such as groundwater in and and semi-arid zones. Environment isotope technologies have been applied and show promise of wide application.

ID POLITICS
AB This article examines forest access rights in the Argentine province of Chubut, where the constitutional framework allows third parties to harvest native timber regardless of whether the underlying land is privately held, being purchased from the province, leased from the provincial government, or occupied illegally by squatters. This article also assesses the promotion of exotic conifer plantations in Chubut, which policymakers view as a fundamental component of economic development. Forest access rights and plantation forestry are examined through the experience of landholders in the upper Percey River watershed, where third-party timber harvest has resulted in conflict over forest resources and landholders have moderately embraced exotic conifers. The elimination of third-party timber extraction, either by privatizing native trees or granting community forest concessions, could provide more incentive to use forest resources sustainably, and numerous environmental and socioeconomic issues must be addressed to ensure the long-term viability of Chubut's effort to promote exotic conifers.

AB Nutrient cycling in a short rotation forest system can be manipulated to give sustainable biomass production and land use. External factors, such as irrigation of meatworks effluent and age of plantation, could play some special role when managing litter in plantation forests to provide biomass sustainably for use as a fuel. These factors were examined for their effects on eucalypt leaf litter decomposition and nutrient release under 1, 2 and 3-year-old short rotation forest plantations grown in New Zealand. Both factors had significant effects on the rate of decomposition and nutrient release. Effluent irrigation significantly increased litter decomposition (from 46 to 62%) and nutrient release under 1-year-old stands, made no significant difference under 2-year-old stands (decomposition: 68 and 66%) and retarded the process under 3-year-old stands (decomposition: from 75 to 42%). In stands without irrigation, the decomposition and nutrient release occurred least under I-year-old stands compared with 2- and 3-year-old stands. Conversely, in stands irrigated with effluent, the decomposition and nutrient release occurred least under 3-year-old stands. Phosphorus, magnesium, and nitrogen accumulated more than their initial amount in the litter, particularly under 3-year-old stands irrigated with effluent. The effects of these external factors should be considered when managing litter in plantation forests to give sustainable biomass production. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The International Soil and Tillage Research Organization (ISTRO) was initiated in 1955 as an activity of the World Ploughing Organization holding the world ploughing contests. The membership of ISTRO has grown from a dozen agricultural engineers and soil scientists in western Europe in the 1950s to 450 members from around the world in 2000. Thematic evolution of ISTRO has addressed four distinct but inter-related issues: (i) ploughing, mechanization and energy/power requirements during the 1950s and 1960s; (ii) reduced ol conservation tillage and mulch farming during the 1970s, and soil compaction, soil strength and soil tilth during the 1980s; (iii) agricultural sustainability and soil quality in the 1990s; (iv) greenhouse effect, environment quality and modeling in the year 2000 and beyond. The ISTRO and its members will continue to play an important role in meeting the ever-increasing food demand of the growing human population of the world without jeopardizing soil and water resources that an already under great stress. A possible future strategy lies in understanding the processes and establishing the cause-effect relationship which create synergistic effects in enhancing productivity per unit input of land, labor, energy and time.

AB Before the arrival of European agricultural technology, technologies addressing the need for more efficient capture and utilisation of resources were being developed in Africa. Land invasions and displacements, the introduction of technologies more suited to European conditions, and increased use of the mouldboard plough and hand hoc slowed and almost halted this revolution. In recent decades farmers have in some areas regained security of tenure, recognised the potential value of indigenous knowledge, and begun to understand the degradation caused by soil inversion and other 'modern' technologies. Conservation tillage is defined as any cropping system which results in conservation of natural or other resources, and sustainable agriculture as the use of agricultural practices which conserve water and soil and are environmentally non-degrading, technically appropriate, economically viable and socially acceptable. Synergising of the will, findings and knowledge of African farmers and agriculturists with the experience and understanding of other conservation tillage researchers, advisers and practitioners throughout the world has resulted in this agrarian revolution gathering momentum. The potential contributions of conservation tillage to sustainable agriculture, and the role of the African Conservation Tillage (ACT) network in assisting and facilitating the process, and identifying and prioritising research needs, are discussed.

AB Agriculture in limited resource areas is characterized by small farms which an generally too small to adequately support the needs of an average farm family. The farming operation can be described as a low input cropping system with the main energy source being manual labor, draught animals and in some areas hand tractors. These farming systems are the most important contributor to the national economy of many developing countries.
   The role of tillage is similar in dryland agricultural systems in both the high input (HICS) and low input cropping systems (LICS), however, wet cultivation or puddling is unique to lowland rice-based systems in low input cropping systems. Evidence suggest that tillage may result in marginal increases in crop yield in the short term, however, in the longer term it may be neutral or give rise to yield decreases associated with soil structural degradation. On marginal soils, tillage may be required to prepare suitable seedbeds or to release adequate Nitrogen through mineralization, but in the longer term, however, tillage reduces soil organic matter content, increases soil erodibility and the emission of greenhouse gases.
   Tillage in low input cropping systems involves a very large proportion of the population and any changes: in current practices such as increased mechanization will have a large social impact such as increased unemployment and increasing feminization of poverty, as mechanization may actually reduce jobs for women. Rapid mechanization is likely to result in failures, but slower change, accompanied by measures to provide alternative rural employment, might be beneficial.
   Agriculture in limited resource areas must produce the food and fiber needs of their community, and its future depends on the development of sustainable tillage/cropping systems that are suitable for the soil and climatic conditions. These should be based on sound biophysical principles and meet the needs of and he acceptable to the farming communities. Some of the principle requirements for a sustainable system includes the maintenance of soil health, an increase in the rain water use efficiency of the system, increased use of fertilizer and the prevention of erosion. The maintenance of crop residues on the surface is paramount for meeting these requirements, and the competing use of crop residues must be met from other sources. These requirements can be met within a zonal tillage system combined with suitable agroforestry, which will reduce the need for crop residues. It is, however, essential that farmers participate in the development of any new technologies to ensure adoption of the new system. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB For the recently initiated programs of sustainable forestry with the Brazilian pine, Araucaria angustifolia, knowledge of the insects associated with this tree is of paramount importance. In a forest reserve on the Serra Geral of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, a three year monitoring was conducted. Forty coleopteran and 5 hymenopteran species totaling about 6200 specimens were recorded, of which 19 and 4 taxa respectively were previously unknown to live on this conifer. They are the coleopterans Lobopoda dallieri (Alleculidae), Taphroderes sahlbergi (Brentidae), Tithonus virescens (Cerambycidae), Plocamocera sp., Enoclerus sp., sp. indet. (Cleridae), Micromimus sp. (Curculionidae: Cossoninae), Corthylus papulans, Xyleborus catharinensis, Xylechinosomus sp. (Curculionidae: Scolytinae), Dilobitarsus quadrituberculatus, Semiotus intermedius, Ptesimopsia sp. (Elateridae), Eudircaea laticornis, Megapsilaphus sexnotatus (Melandryidae), cf. Copidita sp. (Oedemeridae), Ahasverus sp. (Silvanidae), Temnochila sp., sp. indet. (Trogositidae) and the hymenopterans Eubazus sp. (Braconidae), Ephialtes sp., Epirhyssa cf celaena, (Ichneumonidae) and Ophrynopus depressatus (Orussidae). Data on their life histories are provided, and also for the coleopterans Taurorcus chabrillacii (Cerambycidae), Araucarius brasiliensis, Eurycornyophorus scabriculus (Curculionidae: Cossoninae), Corthylus praealtus and C. rufopilosus (Curculionidae: Scolytinae) which were already known to occur on Araucaria trees. The results of our survey provide the first records for many insects, especially beetles, as belonging to the araucariofauna. Some of them can be considered potential pest species. Perspectives of applied forest entomology as well as biogeographic aspects are discussed.

TI Shell, Nigeria and the Ogoni. A study in unsustainable development: II.
   Corporate social responsibility and "stakeholder management' versus a
   rights-based approach to sustainable development
SO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID PERFORMANCE; POLITICS
AB In the first paper in this trilogy (Boele et al., 2001) we described the history of the Royal Dutch/Shell Group from its inception in 1890 through to the year 2000, discussed briefly the importance of corporate reputation to the group and described the significant impacts on Shell of the events of 1995 in Nigeria. We traced the relationship of the Shell Petroleum Development Corporation in Nigeria to impacts on the natural and social environments of the Niger Delta and more specifically on the Ogoni. Finally we discussed the emergence of political resistance and significant conflict between Shell and the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP) and concluded that, despite significant apparent changes in attitude at the group level, distrust and antipathy towards Shell remained entrenched in Ogoni. In this second paper, we explore in more detail issues raised by economic globalization for the practice of corporate social responsibility and stakeholder management, and contrast these concepts with an alternative 'rights-based' approach to sustainable development. We relate our observations to Shell's current approach and conclude that the Shell group and specifically the Shell Petroleum Development Corporation in Nigeria may require an alternative approach to sustainable development if they wish to merit the full confidence of communities in areas of the world as complex and distressed as Ogoni.

SO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Former Soviet Central Asia has inherited severe environmental problems from the Soviet Union, alongside a range of social and political structures and poor economic performance. Subsequent political developments have been highly varied, ranging from the development of relatively open societies to highly authoritarian. A large number of environmental NGOs have been formed in all five republics, some from the Soviet period, but mostly in the independent republics. These have received some support from western institutions. However, while they are successful in undertaking a range of activities, they are often fragmented and have short-term planning and limited impacts of governments. Environmental NGO activity is complicated by the presence of 'quasi'-NGOs with official government support and, in some cases, by the direct participation of NGOs in election processes. Environmental NGOs play an important role in developing a more sustainable society in Central Asia, not least in promoting the concepts of civil society. However, their future development should not necessarily be viewed within western models of NGOs. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

TI Struggling toward sustainability: Considering grassroots development
SO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Grassroots development (GRID) has long been seen as a way of involving the uninvolved stakeholders, a problem identified in other types of development. In examining traditional GRD this paper demonstrates that many of the neo-liberal leanings that have been identified as problematic in macro-scale development are also found in traditional GRID. These are shown to be detrimental to project outcomes. This paper's main contribution is to embed communitarian assumptions into GRID, an action that leads to the articulation of a communitarian grassroots development (CGRD). Extant case studies and conceptual graphic interpretations are used to illustrate the dimensions of CGRD. Central is the need for personal growth and its consequent contribution to community. It is argued that CGRD leads to sustainable development, a goal unattained under neo-liberal assumptions. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. and ERP Environment.

ID DECENTRALIZATION
AB This paper examines the variety of ways in which decentralisation has been used as a centrally-administered panacea for various ills in developing countries. In particular, the paper examines the case of Jordan, and provides a brief overview of previous decentralisation efforts as well as a more in-depth case study of decentralisation in the Petra region, the site of the ancient Nabatean city of Petra. The paper documents the weaknesses of previous planning efforts and considers whether the current efforts to decentralise will result in the protection of the fragile and historically valuable area as well as the stimulation of the local economy. The authors conclude that the current system of decentralised planning does not have the trust of local residents and is unlikely to gain the wider local support needed to ensure the long-run sustainability of the newly completed masterplan for the region.

DE Delphi; indicators; sustainability
AB This paper presents the results of a two round Delphi survey conducted into expert opinion on the development of indicators to measure the movement of the tourism product at a company/resort level towards a position of greater or lesser sustainability. This research Forms part of a wider project to develop indicators that consumers can use in the selection of their holidays and promote a more sustainable form of tourism. The results of this expert survey show considerable disagreement over "sustainability" and where the borders of the concept exist. In addition, the research identified contrasting views over the use of qualitative versus quantitative indicators and the role that consumer pressure can play. The use of the Delphi technique to address complex and uncertain issues is also explored. (C) 2001 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB "Sanfte Mobilitaet" was a European Union-funded project designed to assess various approaches to reducing car dependence by visitors, applied in a number of resorts and wider locations within the Alpine region. Visitor attitude surveys were also conducted using existing theories of tourism taxonomy so as to identify optimal changes to transport aspects of the tourism product. This note reports on the project, focusing on two of the chosen locations, and analyses the results in the context of strategies designed to change existing ratios in visitor travel mode.

TI Energy trade-offs and market responses in transport and residential
   land-use patterns: Promoting sustainable development policy
SO URBAN STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
AB Sustainable development policy is examined for the Belfast Metropolitan Area using a range of linked aggregate and disaggregate models. Energy trade-offs were modelled for both 'stationary' private dwellings and 'mobile' traffic-related energy sources. The research suggests that land-use policies, and in particular corridor-based densification linked to improved public transport, can achieve very significant reductions in mobile energy consumption and modest reductions in stationary energy use linked to residential lay-out design. This would apply to urban areas such as Belfast which exhibit the classic dispersal of population following deindustrialisation. To realise the potential energy savings, sustainable development policy needs to achieve at least the acquiescence of the consumer. Consumers will only support energy-efficient heating systems, improved public transport, densification policies and road charging, if there is some perceived element of financial compensation or other increase in utility for the individual.

DE economic instruments; environment; solid waste; recycle; reduce; reuse;
   sustainable
AB Sustainable solid waste management is a strategy for achieving environmental quality in both the developed and the developing world. Environmental quality is a necessary condition for an increase in per capita welfare over time. The paper suggests alternative instruments for solid waste reduction, re-use and recycling. But to be able to apply the suggested economic instruments, the quantities and composition of the waste must be known. Having identified the current instruments of Botswana's solid waste management (regulatory measures, environmental education, and economic instruments of proper, ty rates, service levy, and sanitation fees), the paper argues that these do not go far enough in enhancing environmental protection. Alternative instruments such as solid waste collection and disposal levies, deposit refund schemes, and product levies are suggested. It is also suggested that public environmental education and regulatory measures should be strengthened.

ID SOILS; DEPOSITION; NITREX
AB We investigated the fate of added N and its effect on N fluxes in a long-term nitrogen fertilisation experiment. Ammonium nitrate was added annually (30 years) at mean rates of 0 (NO), 35 (N1), 73 (N2) and 108 (N3) kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) to a spruce forest in Sweden, which initially showed signs of N deficiency. Net N mineralisation and N leaching were measured in situ together with soil N pools. We used the PnET-CN model to model the maximum sustainable net N mineralisation rate. The short-term fate of added N was studied by addition of (NH4Cl)-N-15. In N1 and N2 most of the added N (80-120%) was retained in the system, compared to 45% in N3. A major fraction was retained in the organic horizons (58-79%). The internal N fluxes had increased considerably as a result of the N additions, Net N mineralisation in N1 had increased by a factor 10 and litterfall N flux by a factor 4. The PnET-CN model could not mimic the fast changes in tree growth and N mineralisation, but the maximum N mineralisation rate seems realistic. The ratio of actual to maximum mineralisation rate indicates that the N1 treatment now is close to N saturation, and nitrate was occasionally found in soil solution from the B-horizon in N1. The N retained was probably to a great extent immobilised directly by mycorrhizal fungi, as indicated by the high amounts of N-15 found in the L and F layers and by the great fraction of N-15 found in amino sugars compared to amino acids.

AB Ionic fluxes in a semi-mature stand of Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis (Bong.) Carr.), on a spodosol in eastern Ireland, were monitored over an eight-year period, 1991-1998. The paper focuses on the long-term viability of forests in this region. Input-output balances, proton budgets and critical loads suggest that the long-term sustainability of forests in the region is threatened unless atmospheric emissions of anthropogenic substances can be controlled.

AB The maximum critical load of sulfur and its exceedance by the sulfur deposition of 1994-1997 were mapped for South Korea with a spatial resolution of 11 X 14 km using the steady-state mass balance method. The Korean soil and geological maps were used as basis for the estimations of the critical alkalinity leaching and the weathering rate of base cations. The normalized difference vegetation index data obtained from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) together with the observed primary productivity of plants were used for the estimation of the critical uptake of base cations. Wet deposition of the non-sea-salt base cations was derived from measured base cation concentrations in precipitation, precipitation rate and air concentration of total suspended particulate while dry deposition of base cations was estimated using the inferential technique using scavenging ratios. The predominant ranges of base cation weathering, uptake and deposition were estimated to be of 200 - 600 eq ha(-1) yf(-1), 200 - 400 eq ha(-1) yr(-1) and 400 - 600 eq ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively. Critical alkalinity leaching was mainly in the range of 1000 - 2000 eq ha(-1) yr(-1) due to relatively high value of precipitation runoff. Exceedance of sulfur critical load was found at 40 % of the ecosystems considered mainly in the southeastern part of Korea, and about 60 % of Korea ecosystems were sustainable against sulfur acidity loadings.

ID GREAT-BRITAIN
AB In many countries there has been much concern over maintaining biodiversity in natural ecosystems in the face of pressures such as changing land use and pollution. The 1992 UN Convention on Biodiversity calls upon signatories to develop national strategies for the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity. In the UK, the potential impacts of sulphur and nitrogen deposition at the national level are being assessed using national critical loads and modelled deposition maps, together with available information on the occurrence of habitats and plant species. This simple approach gives an indication of the areas where atmospheric deposition may have impacts on biodiversity. The results of the analyses are presented and the strengths and weaknesses of the methods used are discussed. This first approach to considering the effects on biodiversity shows the importance of including the effects of atmospheric deposition in any biodiversity action plan. It also highlights those areas where more or improved information is required for the national strategy. With the modelled deposition data available, it would seem that reduced impacts are to be expected by 2010. However, higher resolution deposition data, better estimates of ammonium deposition, consideration of temporal aspects and the dynamics of change, and the use of higher resolution biological data sets are likely to suggest greater impacts than current predictions.

ID BURLEY TOBACCO
AB This study uses the sustainable livelihoods framework to analyze changes in livelihood strategies for 50 case-study households in the Blantyre Shire Highlands, southern Malawi, during 1990-2000. Although evidence from rapid rural appraisal (RRA) suggests that the poor are becoming poorer, the majority (56%) reported an improvement in their economic status. Improvement was linked to market liberalization through higher income from crops (burley tobacco, vegetables, grain legumes) and microenterprise. One-quarter of households were worse off. Downward economic mobility was attributable partly to market liberalization but also to the adverse consequences of widowhood or divorce for female-headed households. Monitoring livelihoods under adjustment requires a pluralist approach that relies not just on RRA but also on quantitative methods, household case studies, and insights from farming systems research.

AB Conservation-with-development (CWD) models currently influential in public policies in Brazil are inappropriate for environmental problems in its agro-pastoral regions. Community mobilization, biodiversity, environmental services, and top-down conservation are severely limited as environmental policy initiatives. Using the case of western Sao Paulo, I illustrate these limitations and outline a more appropriate definition of environmental problems, use of spatial scale. and forms of resource governance. The case study and critique illustrate the need to define appropriate biophysical and land-use regions for public policies and to support initiatives within drainage-basin planning institutions.

AB Land-tenure issues have been prominent forces driving deforestation and the spread of extensive ranching as the dominant land use in Brazilian Amazonia. Southern Para is the part of Amazonia where these issues are most explosive, and an examination of this region in terms of its land-tenure issues. their environmental consequences and measures needed provides potentially valuable information for formulating policies that promote more socially and environmentally sound development. The problems of southern Para are likely to spread to increasingly broader sections of Amazonia. The present paper reviews the current land-tenure situation in southern Para and attempts to identify policy changes that would reduce its environmental impact. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

TI Barriers to uptake of services for coronary heart disease: qualitative
   study
SO BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
ID PREVENTION; ANGINA
AB Objectives To identify factors within the South Yorkshire coalfields that influence use of health services by people with angina.
   Design Qualitative study using semistructured individual and group interviews.
   Setting General practice and community settings in Barnsley and Rotherham health authorities.
   Participants 14 patients with stable angina and nine primary care staff had individual interviews plus five community groups and one group of general practitioners.
   Main outcome measures Barriers to accessing health services.
   Results A complex web of factors was identified that prevented, delayed, or facilitated referral to secondary care. Delay, denial, and self management by patients meant that the Rill extent of symptoms often remained hidden from general practitioners, resulting in a delayed or missed referral. Barriers identified fell into six categories: structural personal, social and cultural, past experience and expectations, diagnostic confusion, and knowledge and awareness.
   Conclusions Many of the factors influencing referral operate before general practitioners become involved. Community development could be one way of tackling inequalities and promoting sustainable change. Structural changes are needed to improve access and increase the acceptability of general practice services. Primary care staff should be educated to detect under-reporting of symptoms and promote appropriate referral.

AB American trypanosomiasis, or Chagas disease, caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi and transmitted by blood-feeding triatomine bugs, is a chronic, frequently fatal infection that is common in Latin America. Neither adequate drugs nor a vaccine is available. A mathematical model calibrated to detailed household data from three villages in northwest Argentina shows that householders could greatly reduce the risk of human infection by excluding domestic animals, especially infected dogs, from bedrooms; removing potential refuges for bugs from waits and ceilings; and using domestically applied insecticides. Low-cost, locally practicable environmental management combined with intermittent use of insecticides can sustainably control transmission of T. cruzi to humans in rural Argentina and probably elsewhere.

ID PRODUCTION COMPETENCE; WORLD-CLASS; PERFORMANCE
AB This work focuses on analysing the growing importance of manufacturing strategies for the competitiveness of firms. It is considered that the emphasis on certain manufacturing competitive priorities (or capabilities) and decisions or practices (on the key decision areas) and their internal coherence can be the base for achieving sustainable or lasting advantages over competitors, thus originating superior business performance. The aim of this research work is to analyse whether or not there exists a correlation between the manufacturing strategy and the competitive success or business performance of a sample of large Spanish industrial firms. The database used is mainly made up of the information from a mail survey, aimed at the industrial firms set up in Spain which in 1994 (study reference date) employed over 200 workers. The results obtained, with the proposed methodology, reveal that it is not possible to identify a direct relationship between the manufacturing strategy and business performance of the sample of firms analysed. In this sense, the chosen manufacturing strategy, that is to say, the emphasis on certain manufacturing competitive priorities and decision areas (or practices) and their coherence, does not enable us to distinguish between best and worst performers, and so does not allow us to explain the level of competitiveness of the sample of large Spanish industrial firms analysed in this work.

TI Hydrologic response of a watershed to land use changes: a remote sensing
   and GIS approach
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
LA English
DT Article
AB In the arid and semi-arid tropics, low annual rainfall together with high intensity rains has resulted in excess runoff, soil erosion and low moisture intake leading to poor crop yields. Therefore, adoption of soil and water conservation measures is necessary for the optimal utilization of natural resources and to increase the productivity of land on a sustainable basis. Remote sensing and GIS techniques can be used for generating development plans for the watershed area in consonance with the production potential and limitation of terrain resources, and can also be used for assessing the impact of these measures before actual implementation in the field. This paper describes a case study for the Jasdan taluka (district) of Rajkot in Gujarat, India. The aims are to prioritize watersheds on the basis of runoff generated, expressed as yield, due to existing land use conditions; to suggest soil and water conservation measures; and to evaluate the hydrologic response of these measures on runoff. The Soil Conservation Service Curve Number (CN) method was used for computing the runoff; subsequently runoff yield in percentage was calculated for prioritizing the watersheds. Satellite and other collateral data were used to identify the problems and potential in the watersheds and recommend measures for soil and water conservation. The impact of these measures was assessed by computing runoff under alternative land use and management practices. It was found that the runoff yield decreased by 42.88% of the pre-conservation value for the watershed.

AB Immunological control of ticks is currently the only sustainable and practical alternative method to the current use of acaricides which has serious limitations. The success of this method is dependent upon identification and cloning of potential tick vaccine antigens. We used a combination of immuno-screening of an adult tick cDNA library as well as the 3 and 5 rapid amplification of cDNA ends to clone two cDNAs, encoding tick saliva proteins from Haemaphysicalis longicornis. The two cDNAs herein named HL 34 and 35 are 1000 by each and encode polypeptides with 292 and 321 amino acid residues respectively. Northern blotting analysis of total RNA from ticks at different feeding stages revealed that expression of both HL 34 and HL35 mRNAs is induced during the slow feeding phase. We speculate that the functions of both genes are closely associated with blood feeding. Expression analysis by RT-PCR showed that both genes are expressed in other tick organs in addition to salivary glands. Recombinant HL 34 was successfully expressed in Escherichia coli and its suitability as a tick vaccine antigen was analyzed in rabbits. We propose that rHL34 could be a useful component of a cocktail tick vaccine. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Rice is a major food grain crop of the world. However, its sustainability in major rice growing areas is being threatened by water and energy related constraints. With these constraints in view, a 2 year field study was conducted to assess the effects of soil and water management practices on crop growth and water balance components in rice on sandy loam and silty clay loam soils of a semiarid subtropical environment of north India. Treatments included two irrigation regimes - continuous submergence (I-1) and intermittent submergence 2 days after drainage (I-2) in main plots, and three puddling intensities - no puddling (P-0), two discing + one planking (P-2), and four discing + one planking (P-4) in subplots. Increase in puddling intensity significantly increased depth of puddle and decreased saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-s) of the puddled layer in both the soils. Increase in puddling intensity from P-0 to P-2 or P-4 significantly increased leaf area index and dry matter production. There was no difference in these parameters in P-2 and P-4 However, grain yield increased significantly with increase in puddling intensity.
   The modified SAWAH model satisfactorily simulated seasonal change in soil water storage and daily water loss (ET + percolation). Coefficient of determination between predicted and measured values of daily water loss was 0.96 in sandy loam and 0.86 in silty clay loam. Intermittent irrigation (I-2) and increased puddling intensity significantly decreased percolation loss on both the soils. Minimum percolation losses occurred in I2P4 treatment. Puddling intensity and intermittent flooding in combination resulted in higher water use efficiency. Early transplanted (10th June, high evaporativity) rice crop evapotranspired 11 cm more water than late transplanted (25th June, low evaporativity) crop without any significant change in grain yield. This study demonstrates that intermittent irrigation coupled with increased puddling intensity and shift of transplanting date toward low evaporativity period may help to check decline in water table and make the system energy-efficient.

AB Six supplementary irrigation management options for grazed grassland were defined and their effects on both agricultural production and nitrate leaching to the groundwater were studied. Data were available from the De Marke experimental farm for sustainable dairy farming. The calibrated and validated simulation models SWACROP and ANIMO were used to calculate the effects of the different irrigation management options on crop transpiration, and on water fluxes and nitrate concentrations for three fields of the farm. Comparisons with the common practice at the farm were made. A change in application volume from 25 to 15 mm per irrigation resulted in higher irrigation efficiencies and lower annual water use for supplementary irrigation with only small changes in the ratio of actual and potential transpiration (T-a/T-p). The advisory system 'irrigation planner' generally also resulted in high irrigation efficiencies combined with a reduction of water use and a small effect on the transpiration ratio. The different irrigation strategies had no significant effect on nitrate concentrations in the leachate from two dry fields studied. For the relatively wet field in this study an increase of irrigation water use would improve agricultural production conditions and reduce nitrate concentrations at 1 m depth. For the evaluation of environmental effects of irrigation management options it is advised to assess the actual nitrate concentrations and not only the water fluxes, which potentially cause solute leaching.

DT Article
AB Since the year 1992, when the model of "sustainable development" was adopted during the UN conference "Environment and Development" in Rio de Janeiro with the action program "Agenda 21" and the,climatic frame convention", "economy, ecology and social affairs" have become categories of equal rank in the global concept of development.
   In late 1997 in Kyoto, 38 industrial states committed themselves to an international total reduction of the six greenhouse gases CO2, CH4, N2O, PFC, HFC and SF6 by at least 5.2 % by 2012 at the latest in comparison with 1990. The Kyoto commitments of the European Union as a whole and the EU internal burden sharing determined in mid 1998 will be shown.
   Germany had already passed a precautionary 25 % CO2 reduction for the target year 2005 in 1990. A main part of these politics since 1995 has been the self-commitment of German economy. This was substantially developed during the last year with a view to the Kyoto target year 2012 and has taken on the form of an agreement. Moreover, the economy's emission reduction contribution is a mainstay of the new national environmental protection plan made by the federal government on 11th November 2000.
   Basis of the new agreement be tween the government of the Federal Republic of Germany and the German economy for precautionary measures for the protection of the environment from 9th November 2000 are the individual statements made by the commercial associations involved, in which the commitments are put into concrete terms and substantiated. This in-commitment of the creased self steel industry under consideration of decisive factors of European and worldwide developments is the first expression of a long term and future oriented position in climatic precautions and sustainability.

First, the environmental setting of the lake is presented. Study of the regional distribution of lacustrine sediments, and a detailed analysis of their sedimentary facies (texture, organic matter content) suggest major changes in size and depth of the lake and in past sedimentation. Insight into the long-term development of the lake (sedimentation processes) is highly relevant for sustainable use of the present lake. Analysis of diatom assemblages provides further detail of the changing aquatic settings of the lake; lake levels rise quickly around 33,000 and 12,000 yr B.P., fall dramatically between +/- 30,000 and 13,000 yr B.P. and are lowered gradually since approximately 6000 yr B.P., following Early Holocene high lake levels. Drainage of the lake is affected by both volcanic depositional events and regional climatic events. Palynological analysis is indicative of local palaeoecological settings in the lake area and regional climatic change; a distinct, Late Pleistocene phase, with lower precipitation and lowered mean temperatures is inferred. Furthermore, progressive deforestation of the Tondano uplands is evident, as well as diffuse anthropogenic/volcanic vegetation disturbance from the early Mid Holocene onwards. Information from sedimentary facies, diatom assemblages and local palaeoecology (pollen) are integrated to reconstruct palaeoenvironmental settings and processes in the lake area. This record of environmental change as well as the pollen-based record of regional vegetation and climate change corroborates other palaeoenvironmental data derived from the few terrestrial sites in the region, The data attribute a greater magnitude of temperature and precipitation change in the region than is commonly deduced in studies based on marine faunal and sedimentary records. The Lake Tondano sedimentary record is highly suitable for further analysis aimed at determining the exact timing and amplitudes of environmental change in the SE Asian equatorial region.

AB The Ni-supported catalysts have been prepared in situ by the solid phase crystallization (spc) method starting from layered double hydroxides (LDHs) as the precursor and tested for the partial oxidation of methane to synthesis gas. The spc-Ni/M-Al (M: Mg, Ca and Sr) catalysts were prepared from Ni-M/Al-LDHs as the precursors, and the activities were studied in relation to the structure of the catalysts and compared with those prepared by the impregnation method. Among the catalysts tested, spc-Ni/Ca-Al was easily reduced to form active Ni metal particles during the reaction and showed the highest activity and selectivity to synthesis gas production as well as the highest sustainability against coke formation on the catalyst. The high activity and the high sustainability against coke formation of spc-Ni/Ca-Al may be due to the stable and highly dispersed Ni metal particles in addition to the basic property of Ca-Al mixed oxide as the support.

AB The Everglades and South Florida ecosystems are the focus of national and international attention because of their current degraded and threatened state. Ecological risk assessment, sustainability, and ecosystem and adaptive management principles and processes are being used nationally as a decision and policy framework for a variety of types of ecological assessments. The intent of this study is to demonstrate the application of these paradigms and principles at a regional scale. The effects-directed assessment approach used in this study consists of a retrospective, eco-epidemiological phase to determine the causes for the current conditions and a prospective predictive risk-based assessment using scenario analysis to evaluate future options. Embedded in these assessment phases is a process that begins with the identification of goals and societal preferences which are used to develop an integrated suite of risk-based and policy relevant conceptual models. Conceptual models are used to illustrate the linkages among management (societal) actions, environmental stressors, and societal/ecological effects, and provide the basis for developing and testing causal hypotheses. These models, developed for a variety of landscape units and their drivers, stressors, and endpoints, are used to formulate hypotheses to explain the current conditions. They are also used as the basis for structuring management scenarios and analyses to project the temporal and spatial magnitude of risk reduction and system recovery. Within the context of recovery, the conceptual models are used in the initial development of performance criteria for those stressors that are determined to be most important in shaping the landscape, and to guide the use of numerical models used to develop quantitative performance criteria in the scenario analysis. The results will be discussed within an ecosystem and adaptive management framework that provides the foundation for decision making. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents the basis of a new research paradigm, integrated natural resource management, which aims to increase agricultural production in tropical countries in a sustainable manner. Integrated natural resource management (NRM) combines traditional germplasm improvement approaches with NRM concerns. The theoretical framework underlying this approach is based on concepts of natural capital and ecosystem hierarchy, and highlights the role of natural capital in providing ecosystem services such as nutrient and water cycling acid C sequestration, which may be lost or reduced in intensive agricultural systems. The main components of an integrated NRM agenda are explored. and the need for research to be carried out by interdisciplinary teams including ecologists, social scientists and economists at a range of spatial and temporal scales is discussed.

AB Farm households form a significant unit of study for the rural policy analyst as it is at this level of aggregation that the decisions to participate in government policy initiatives and to adopt new technologies are taken, although the true micro-level impacts of such decisions might be felt more acutely at the intra-household level. This paper describes a range of modelling approaches that have been used to represent micro-level decision making related to sustainable agricultural development. While none of the examples was undertaken in a pluralistic framework, they illustrate that two or more methodologies can be integrated so that the complementarity and/or conflict between the results would enhance the quality of the outcomes. The paper argues that because of the integrated nature of the relationship between the farm household (or the decision-making unit), the farming system, and the environment, more progress can be made by using more than one methodology even though their assumptions may be incompatible and their results imply different solutions to the problem. The dialogue created by this diversity will provide better solutions than a reliance on one paradigm and its associated methodologies. One methodological approach will not be sufficient to capture the decision-making process and its subsequent impacts and a pluralist approach is advocated. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB In the search for Integrated Nutrient Management practices in response to the widely observed soil fertility decline in Sub-Saharan Africa, the potential of low-external-input and organic farming remains to be systematically examined. The nutrient monitoring concept was used to assess the impact of technologies on nutrient flows and economic performance at activity and farm household level in Machakos district, Kenya. The nutrient flows and balances and economic performance indicators of farms practising low-external input agriculture (LEIA) technologies for a number of years were compared with a group of farms practising conventional farm management. Based upon monitoring two farming seasons, it was concluded that both subsistence-oriented farm management systems result in serious N-depletion and that 60-80% of farm income is based upon nutrient mining. No significant differences could be found between the LEIA and conventional farm management group. Only if LEIA farm management reduces nutrient losses through leaching and gaseous losses can a positive impact on nutrient balance be expected. Off-farm income plays a crucial role, especially in the conventional management group, in keeping farm household income levels above the poverty line. High-level compost application treatments in maize are attractive if labour and organic inputs are available. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Sustainable land use in agricultural systems involves the implementation of agricultural practices at the landscape level instead of at a field level. To test the above hypothesis a case study was conducted in two valleys of the Central Pyrenees (France), with two villages using two contrasting farming patterns: one village used a strong group organisation of agricultural practices at the valley level, while the other used a collection of practices at thr: field level. Two indicators of landscape organisation were used on both villages. The first indicator was the statistical contribution of the environment to the choice of agricultural practices by farmers, and was calculated at the field level on the overall valley territory. The second indicator was based on relationships between agro-ecological units and farms, measured at the valley level. The comparison between the group practices organised at, the valley level and the individual practices organised at the field level showed that the latter system, with fragile and unstable agro-ecological units, had spatially specialised farms, and environmentally independent agricultural practices. Conversely the group practices used at the valley level were linked to stable agro-ecological units, fragmented farms, and environmentally dependent agricultural practices. The ecological sustainability of larger territories seemed to be in opposition with the standard criteria judging economical sustainability of farms. This analysis showed that the dependence of agricultural practices on the environmental features (i.e. the valley level versus the individual farm) secured the sustainability of che resources and landscape, even if it was in contradiction with a farm's economical criteria. The assessment of agro-environmental practices at a landscape level, intended as a natural level of organisation (such as valleys or watersheds) and larger than the plot level, is necessary, in order to enhance the effectiveness of future agricultural policies.

AB The effects of tillage and preceding legume crops on N flux in the soil-plant system require quantification For developing sustainable cropping systems. We measured changes in soil and plant N under the influence of tillage [no till (NT) vs, conventional tillage (CT)] and previous crops [spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) green manure, and field pea (Pisum sativum L.)]. The study was conducted from 1994 through 1996 on a well-drained sandy loam soil (coarse-loamy, mixed, frigid, Typic Cryoboralf) near Fort Vermilion, Alberta (58 degrees 23'N, 116 degrees2'W). Nitrogen uptake by wheat was increased by NT and legume crops, At seeding, CT soil had 28 kg ha(-1) more NO3-N to 100-cm depth than NT soil. Apparent net N mineralization in the growing season was 71 and 22 kg N ha(-1), respectively, for the NT and CT systems. Previous crop effect on net N mineralization (kg N ha(-1)) was red clover (56) > field pea (51) > wheat (34). Approximately 18 kg N ha(-1) was net-mineralized from red clover residues compared with insignificant amounts from pea and wheat residues. Microbial biomass turnover's contribution to net N mineralization (28 to 40 kg N ha(-1)) was increased by NT and previous legume crop, Soluble organic N decreased by 7 kg ha(-1) between seeding and maturity for all experimental treatments. The results indicate that N fertilizer recommendations should allow for greater mineralization of organic N ender NT than CT and following a legume green manure.

TI Biomass production of 'Alamo' switchgrass in response to nitrogen,
   phosphorus, and row spacing
SO AGRONOMY JOURNAL

ID MANAGEMENT; CULTIVARS; FEEDSTOCK; GRASSES; WATER
AB Management practices for biomass production of bioenergy grasses may differ from management for forage. Our objective was to determine the yield and stand responses of 'Alamo' switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L,) to N and P fertilization as affected by row spacing. A combination of five rates each of N and P were applied to plots during 1992 to 1998 at Stephenville. TX and 1993 to 1995 at Beeville, TX. Three row-spacing treatments were applied as subplots. Biomass production was determined each year with a single harvest in late summer, Tiller density and tiller mass were measured during 1993 to 1996 at Stephenville, Biomass production was not influenced by the addition of P, Biomass production response to N at Beeville was greater in narrow rows than wide rows during the establishment year only. Biomass production responses to N were quadratic in 5 of 7 yr at Stephenville and linear at Beeville, A maximum yield of 22.5 Mg ha(-1) occurred during 1995 at Stephenville at 168 kg N ha(-1), Lodging occurred at both locations but only at the 224 kg N ha(-1) rate. Tiller density and mass increased as row width increased, Tiller mass also increased with increasing N fertility at Stephenville. This response was more important in determining biomass production than was tiller density, Average biomass production at 168 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) was 14.5 and 10.7 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) at Stephenville and Beeville, respectively, Biomass production without applied N tended to decline over the years. Our data indicated that switchgrass biomass production is sustainable at Stephenville only with the application of at least 168 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) but P application and row spacing are not crucial.

AB Cysticercosis, the infection by the larvae of Taenia solium, is a major cause of acquired epilepsy in the world; it also causes significant economic loss because of contaminated pork. This disease is endemic in most developing countries and no control strategy has yet been proven efficient and sustainable. To further evaluate the full potential of single-dose oxfendazole treatment for pigs as a control measure, 20 pigs with cysticercosis were treated with oxfendazole and later matched with 41 naive pigs and exposed to a natural challenge in a hyperendemic area. New infections were found by serologic testing in 15 of the 32 controls (47%), and by the presence of cysts at necropsy in 12 of them (37%). Only minute residual scars were detected in the carcasses of oxfendazole-treated pigs. Pigs with cysticercosis, once treated with oxfendazole, are protected from new infections for at least three months.

AB This paper highlights the possibilities of natural regeneration on degraded hillslopes in Southern Wello, Ethiopia, based on an investigation of eight fenced permanent plots in degraded habitats, shrublands and secondary forests. To compare processes of vegetation recovery and succession between the study sites and through time, vegetation data were collected from the tree/shrub and field layers of the eight plots during 1991-4. A general increase in species richness, number of individuals and crown cover was observed, and these increases were more evident in the relatively degraded areas than in the shrublands and secondary forests. This trend is in accordance with the results of short-lived hillside closures witnessed before the change of government in the country in 1991 and implies that there is a possibility of regeneration if the hillslopes can be kept free of human and animal intervention. However, successful regeneration of these hillslopes will depend on clearly defined sustainable development projects and on increasing the participation of the local people.

AB Effects of light, temperature, water and meatworks effluent irrigation on the decomposition of Eucalyptus globulus leaf litter were examined in a pot trial under controlled conditions in three growth cabinets. All four factors had significant effects on the rate of litter decomposition, and interacted with each other. More dry mass loss occurred from the bagged litter under light than under shaded conditions. There was little difference between water and effluent irrigation under shaded conditions, but more loss from the litter irrigated with effluent under light. Differences between water and effluent irrigation occurred mainly at the lowest temperature regime (5 degreesC). The greater the irrigation rate, the more the litter dry mass loss in most cases under light. However, irrigation rate only had a small effect under shaded conditions. A large range of instantaneous decay constants (k) was found, from 0.01 to 1.34 per year, comparable with those reported in field studies. Hence, these environmental factors should be considered when managing litter in forests to give sustainable biomass production and land use, particularly for short rotation forests linked with effluent land treatment.

AB 1. Corallium rubrum is a precious circum-Mediterranean octocoral. which occurs on rocky reefs between 10 and over 250 m in depth.
   2. This species has been harvested for a long time and most commercial populations have been over-exploited. The Mediterranean overall yield was reduced by 66% over the last 15 years.
   3. Two type populations may be identified: (a) dense shallow-water populations consisting of small, slow-growing, short-lived colonies and (b) deep-dwelling populations. composed of large, sparse. long-lived colonies. The former populations have little economic value. but should ensure a reproductive stock for the species.
   4. While the structure and demography of shallow-water populations have been studied, the demographic parameters of deep-dwelling populations are largely unknown.
   5. Recent genetic studies quantified levels of genetic divergence among coastal populations. Estimated numbers of migrants among populations suggested that the planulae of C. rubrum have short-range dispersal. Geographic distances greater than 100 km can be considered as the threshold for genetic divergence between populations.
   6. Development of a regime for the sustainable exploitation of this species requires a better knowledge of population dynamics, life-history traits and quantitative genetics, especially concerning commercial populations. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Albania possesses enormous potential in terms of environment resources. which could play a leading role in the economic reconstruction of the country. A great heritage of environmental resources, as well as of historical and archaeological sites. occurs along the coasts, which could allow, a substantial development in the sector of tourism. Among the many priorities facing this emerging country, a valorization of the coastline may reveal that it represents one of the country's greatest resources. even if, at the moment, it shows signs of degradation and pollution.

AB Objective: To compare muscle activation deficits and muscle physiology in older versus younger adults.
   Design: A maximal volitional isometric contraction of the quadriceps muscle with burst-superimposition was used to assess strength and activation. In addition, force-frequency testing during fresh, fatigue, and recovery conditions and electrically elicited fatigue testing were performed.
   Setting: Muscle performance laboratory.
   Patients: Healthy, active young (age range, 20-28yr) and older (age range, 66-83yr) subjects.
   Main Outcome Measures: Torque production, activation of the quadriceps, F-50 values from the force-frequency relationships (frequency at which 50% of the maximum normalized force is produced), and the average amount of fatigue.
   Results: Older subjects were weaker (574.4 +/- 156N) than younger subjects (900.9 +/- 295N) and had significantly greater deficits in central activation in the quadriceps muscles (elderly = 95.5% activation; younger = 98.1% activation). The force-frequency curves for the elderly were to the left of the younger subjects for all 3 testing conditions. Aged muscles fatigued to the same extent as younger muscle (young = 49.8% +/- 2.6%, elderly = 51.1% +/- 2.8%).
   Conclusions: These results can be used to modify high-intensity strength training protocols designed to optimize sustainable strength gains in the elderly during rehabilitation.

AB Attempts to transform political agendas are closely associated with the role of the media in shaping perceptions, reflecting programs of political organisations, influencing institutional practices and applying pressure on divergent interests. By examining the role of an influential news magazine in voicing concerns about welfare and environment policies over a 40-year period, this article tests arguments about the salience of 'old' and 'new' politics issues as well as the changing character of debates about these questions in efforts to create a sustainable, competitive and global economy. Apart from examining the capacity of the media to change their storylines (or ways of thinking about an issue), the article considers how they attempt to draw on credible news sources to substantiate their reports.

AB Recent interest in soil tillage and residue management has focused on low-input sustainable agriculture. This study was conducted to investigate the effect of three tillage systems (no-till, chisel plow, and moldboard plow) and four residue placements (bare, normal, mulch, and double mulch) on a most recently detected enzyme in soils, arylamidase activity. This enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of an N-terminal amino acid from peptides, amides, or arylamides. Results showed that arylamidase activity is greatly affected by tillage and crop residue placement. The greatest activity was found with chisel/mulch, moldboard plow/mulch, and no-till/double mulch, and the lowest with moldboard plow/normal and no-till/bare. Arylamidase activity was significantly correlated with organic C (r=0.59**) and soil PHCaCl2 (r=0.55**), and decreased with soil depth. Results of this work suggest that the activity of this enzyme is affected by soil management, and indicate its potential ecological significance because of its role in the N cycle.

AB Ecologically engineered wastewater treatment facilities, such as constructed wetlands and infiltration plants, can be further improved in their P retention by using reactive media with a high P-retention capacity. in a sustainable system, the sorbed P should be recycled in agricultural production. The objective of the present study was to determine the plant availability of P,sorbed to different P-retention media. The studied media were: crystalline and amorphous blast furnace slag, natural and burned opoka(a bedrock from Poland), limestone burned lime, soil from a spodic B horizon, and, light expanded clay aggregates (LECA). They were soaked in a P solution, rinsed and dried before incorporation into soil. An additional aim was to compare P taken up by barley with amounts chemically extracted for the estimation of plant-available soil P. P sorbed to the crystalline slag was delivered to the barley plants more efficiently than P added in K2HPO4 fertiliser. Soil extraction with acid ammonium lactate correlated well with P taken up by barley and indicated that P bound to Ca is more available to plants than P bound to:AI and Fe. The Mg content of the used slag may replace Mg fertilisation in certain soils. It was concluded that among the investigated filter materials, crystalline slag was the most suitable sorbent from an agricultural point of view, since it possessed a large P-sorption capacity and the sorbed P was largely plant available. The heavy metal content of sorption materials must be examined carefully before their application to agricultural soils.

AB A long-term rice-wheat experiment was conducted at Parwanipur, Nepal, to study the effects of organic and mineral sources of nutrients on yield and nutrient status of the soil. Twelve treatments comprising different combinations of inorganic N, P, and K; farmyard manure (FYM); and wheat chopped straw (WCS) were included. On average during a 20-year period, the control plot with an indigenous nutrient supply supported 2.06 Mg rice ha(-1) and 0.69 Mg wheat ha(-1). The application of 100 kg N ha(-1) increased yields, but the addition of P, K, Zn, and S gave no response, indicating that the soil supply of these nutrients did not limit yield. The grain yield of rice and wheat was maintained over the years. Soil analyses of the past 6 years (1994-1999) showed that treatments receiving organic sources of nutrients increased total soil C and N from 18% to 62% and 15% to 48%, respectively, compared with the NPK treatment. There was a buildup of total P and Olsen P in plots receiving FYM. However, total and available soil K were similar in all the treatments. The apparent N and P balances for the rice-wheat system were positive in the NPK, FYM, and WCS treatments, whereas the K balance was negative in all the treatments except with the application of FYM to both rice and wheat. Rice and wheat in most years yielded <3.15 Mg ha(-1) and <2.16 Mg ha(-1), respectively. These yields are only 40-50% of the potential attainable yields of this region. Possible reasons for low yields are discussed.

AB This work investigates pilocarpine trapped in a matrix diffusion-controlled drug delivery system using hydrophilic inserts of Poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (pHEMA) to ensure an increased bioavailability of pilocarpine and prolong the length of time in which the medication remains in the eyes of the test subjects. The physical and chemical properties of pilocarpine were investigated to elucidate the mechanism of drug-polymer interaction and the effect on drug release behavior of controlled release polymeric devices. In vitro release studies indicated that pilocarpine continued to be released from the inserts for a 24 h period. The results of intraocular pressure tests performed on albino rabbits were consistent with the observed in vitro behavior. The pressure decrease was significant for a period longer than 48 h. It confirms that the inserts, as sustainable releasing devices, are promising carriers for ophthalmic drug delivery systems. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

   public policy; sustainability; technology transfer; urban development
AB China is engaged in a massive urban development programme, together with large infrastructure investments in road and transit systems. This development is occurring in the context of a shift towards a market economy, but China is still a developing country. China and the rest of the world are poised at a critical moment of decision. For China to provide an international standard of living for its entire population using the Western model of consumption would require vast resources. Many of these resources are relatively scarce in China, and the cost of imports at world prices is prohibitive for China. Furthermore, the future resource cost and impact on the environment of operating cities in China will be overwhelming if they are developed to conventional, Western standards. This has already been recognized for industry and utilities in China, where many modernizations and energy efficiency improvements have been made. However the residential sector, which is now the fastest growing sector in terms of energy and materials demands, has not received sufficient attention. One option is to advance the 'sustainable design approach' based on highly efficient buildings, transportation systems and utilities, and preserving the productive: capacity of land and restoring air and water quality. China has many resourceful traditions that can form a basis for a culturally specific approach to sustainability, but foreign assistance and technology transfer will be required, as well as Government policy incentives and their implementation within China. Especially needed are clean industry technology, durable and energy efficient building systems, renewable energy systems, and environmental cleanup and recycling systems.

AB The integration of various sustainable management techniques in cropping systems can potentially reduce agro-environmental problems, but may warrant a new approach to weed management, due to changes in weed communities. A 3-yr experiment was conducted to determine the effects and interactions of tillage (moldboard plow or chisel plow), weed control method (chemical or mechanical), and nutrient source (mineral fertilizers or liquid hog manure supplemented with mineral fertilizers) on crops and weeds in a corn (Zea mays L.)-soybean (Glycine mar (L.) Merr.) rotation on two soils (a Sainte-Rosalie clay and a Duravin clay loam, Orthic Gleysols), at Saint-Hyacinthe, Quebec. In most cases, weed density and biomass were more important with mechanical than with chemical control. Nutrient source did not affect weed density, but weed biomass was higher in the manure than the mineral treatment in 1997. Weed populations on both soils were greater with chisel plow tillage combined with mechanical weed control. The presence of crop residues in chisel plow systems may have hindered the efficacy of mechanical weed control operations, particularly when corn was the previous crop. Soybean populations, mid-season biomass and yields were reduced in chisel plow compared with moldboard plow tillage. Corn populations and mid-season biomass were not affected by any of the factors, whereas corn yields showed variable responses over the years. Efficacy of mechanical weed control would need to be enhanced or complemented with other weed control methods, in order to reduce the risks of weed infestations and lower crop yields, particularly in conservation tillage systems. Liquid hog manure would have little effect on weed populations, but would need to be adequately balanced in order to ensure proper crop nutrition and optimum yields.

AB Timber harvest schedules form the heart of forest resource management. The operations research methodology is applied to resolving the multi-product, multi-period sustainable timber harvest scheduling problems, where area constraints, harvest flow constraints, and ending inventory constraints are imposed. By taking advantage of the model. characterization of block diagonal constraints with multiple sets of network sub-problems and the set of coupling constraints, an efficient algorithm is explored. Specifically, a primal-dual method of closed-form solutions is first developed to solve the network sub-problems on the individual basis. Then, a primal-dual steepest-edge algorithm that achieves the global optimum is presented. A numerical example illustrating steps of the solution procedure is presented. The proposed algorithm is implemented, and its performance is compared with that of the AMPL-CPLEX package. The proposed primal-dual algorithm achieves, on the average, an approximately four to one reduction in iteration numbers and an about eight to one reduction in the CPU execution time.

AB In this paper we present calculations of the ecological footprint (EF) for Austria 1926-1995, based upon three different methodological approaches. Basically, EF calculations convert the use of selected materials in a country into the area needed to sustain this material Row. Therefore, biological productivity essentially determines the outcome of EF calculations, given a certain pattern of socioeconomic metabolism In most EF calculations published thus far. material and energy flows are converted to area (hectares) using global yields of the respective year. In contrast, we analyze the effect different assumptions on yields have on the results of EF calculations by assuming: (1) constant global yields as of 1995; (2) variable global yields; and (3) variable local yields for domestic extraction and variable global yields for imported biomass. Fossil-energy footprint is evaluated on the basis of constant carbon sequestration rates published by Wackernagel. According to our results different assumptions on yields can influence the result of EF calculations by a factor of 2, at least. We conclude that further research is necessary with respect to biomass yields assumed in EF calculations. The purpose for which EF calculations;Ire made, and the interpretation of their results, will determine future development of the EF methodology. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The use of gypsiferous mine water for irrigation of agricultural crops is a promising technology, which could alleviate a shortage of irrigation water and address the problem of disposal of mine effluent. A field trial was established at Kleinkopje Colliery in Witbank (Mpumalanga Province, South Africa) during the 1997-1998 season. Sugar beans and wheat were irrigated with three center pivots, on both virgin and rehabilitated land. The objectives were to determine crop response to irrigation with two types of mine water, to determine the impact of irrigation with inferior quality water on virgin and rehabilitated soil, and to collect atmospheric, crop and soil data for detailed validation of the soil water balance (SWB) computer model. Crop yields were generally satisfactory. Yield of sugar beans on rehabilitated land was low compared with virgin land, probably due to the late planting date, hail damage and soil compaction. SWB simulations were compared with field measurements of weather, crop growth, water and salt balance parameters. Both field measurements and model simulations indicated an increase in soil salinity, with limited drainage and salt leaching. Long-term simulations of the water and salt balance were carried out with SWB to predict the long-term sustainability of irrigating with gypsiferous water. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Restoring self-sustaining tropical forest ecosystems on surface mined sites is a formidable challenge that requires the integration of proven reclamation techniques and reforestation strategies appropriate to specific site conditions, including landscape biodiversity patterns. Restorationists working in most tropical settings are usually hampered by lack of basic information on the wide variety of native tree species that characterize the pre-disturbance forests, as well as insufficient understanding of the ecology of disturbance and natural recovery to design effective restoration programs. A notable exception to this is the forest restoration program developed since the early 1980s by a Brazilian bauxite mining company operating at Trombetas in Para State in central Amazonia. A systematic nursery and field research strategy was used to develop a reforestation program based on mixed plantings of mon than 70 native old-growth forest tree species. This technique has been used to replant about 100 ha of deforested minelands each year over the past 15 years. Research in recent years has evaluated this approach and other, generally simpler, reforestation methods used at a smaller scale at this site. Post-plantation biodiversity development and other indicators of restoration success or sustainability were recorded. The results of these studies have shown the overwhelming importance of careful site preparation and topsoil handling/replacement practices in determining both future productivity and biodiversity of the redeveloping forests, irrespective of the complexity of the planting design used. The inclusion of a wide variety of forest species, particularly later successional species, was very important for long-range restoration owing to limitations on natural recovery processes that inhibit seed dispersal and subsequent colonization of many old-growth forest species. Many of the: lessons learned at this site an applicable to improve the design of mineland rehabilitation and forest restoration programs worldwide. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The economic importance of gaharu is assessed in three villages on the Bahau River in north-central Borneo to gain insights about the incentives for harvesting and management of a valuable nontimber forest product. Three indicators of economic value-level and proportion of income, returns to labor, and proportion of gaharu collecting households per village-are used to demonstrate the multiple incentives that NTFP income can generate. The concept of incentive logic is developed as an analytical technique to show how economic values can be linked to incentives for different types of management actions. The article discusses how incentives from gaharu income were most likely linked to the stake local people had in the resource, their preferences about which forest product to harvest, and their willingness to engage in collective action. These incentives contributed to sustainability to the extent they induced actions that reduce threats to the resource. The article suggests that an understanding of the influence of economic incentives on people's resource management can be improved by recognizing three factors: the multiple incentives created by an income, the logical link of those incentives to a management action, and the influence of other sociocultural and biophysical factors on management.

AB In an oligopoly supergame, firms' actions in prices and quantities are subject to non-negativity constraints. These constraints can obstruct the practicability of some of the tacitly collusive subgame perfect equilibria, such as single-period optimal punishment which relies indispensably upon firms' ability to charge prices strictly below marginal costs, i.e. temporarily loss making pricing. Thereby under the presence of positive price constraints, marginal costs can serve as a 'fudge' to materialise such penal pricing. In this paper we briefly shed light on the effects of profit-cost ratios (or mark-ups) on the sustainability of tacit collusion. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The authors review evidence on the interaction between consumer response and urban design. They present empirical results from research undertaken in Belfast, in which a variety of techniques, including transportation modelling, hedonic analysis, a household survey, and stated-preference modelling, were used. Theory relating to density is discussed and applied to an inner-city redevelopment scheme. The evidence from the stated-preference analysis offers a tool which can inform not only policies, but also the promotion of sustainable development in viable locations, consistent with the business goals of property developers. The same tool can also help identify areas where intensification of land use should not be promoted. Further research developments are considered, with particular emphasis on future urban policies.

ID SUSTAINABILITY; ALLOCATION; RHINE; SOIL
AB The aim of this paper is to analyze the potential of indicators for integrated river basin management and to develop a set of indicators for the management of transboundary river basins. An indicator, comprising a variable or some aggregation of variables, describes a system pr process such that it has significance beyond the face value of its components. Integrated river basin management lakes into account policies and measures for the multifunctional use of rivers on a catchment scale and associated institutional changes. Indicators are useful instruments for this process for two reasons. Firstly, they meet the information need of policy- and decision-makers. Secondly, indicators can be used to structure the definition and description of information needs and collection of information between the different international, institutional, and sectoral management levels. The development of indicators-involves a number of steps: definition of aim, construction of conceptual model, selection of variables, comparison with selection criteria, database assess ment, and indicator selection. In this paper these steps are discussed and specified for integrated river basin management. This results in a set of indicators describing the pressure to the river, the state of the river ecosystem, the impact to goods and services provided by the river, and:the societal response. The proposed set of indicators measured at a river basin scale provides integrated information an the use and supply of goods;and services, underlying cause-effect relationships and possible trade-offs and their spatial distribution (e,g., upstream versus downstream). Furthermore, we propose a division of tasks and responsibilities for river basin management with regard to the development of indicators, data collection, and their application in decision-making.

ID RECHARGE
AB Monitoring groundwaters under the influence of reclaimed water must consider the major constituents of concern in reclaimed water. This research focused on the fate of dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen species at field sites located throughout the Southwestern United States. A watershed approach was developed to predict the fate of dissolved organic carbon as a function of the drinking water dissolved organic carbon concentration and the total dissolved solids concentration in the reclaimed water. Extensive characterization of the dissolved organic carbon recovered from groundwaters under the influence of reclaimed water was done. With the exception of fluorescence spectroscopy, the dissolved organic carbon present in effluent organic matter was similar in structure, character and reactivity as compared to natural organic matter. Evidence for sustainable nitrogen removal mechanisms during groundwater recharge with reclaimed water was obtained. The autotrophic reaction between ammonia and nitrate appears to a mechanism for the removal nitrogen in a carbon-depleted environment. The monitoring tools and methodologies developed in this research can be used to assure protection of public health and determine the sustainability of indirect potable reuse projects.

AB The establishment of the EU's Rural Development Regulation (EC 1257/99) reflects the continuing efforts of policymakers to develop integrated policy initiatives for the pursuit of sustainable rural development. The resulting changes have been given added impetus in UK regions by the emergence of new forms of rural governance under devolution. This process is also highlighting the need for governments to respond flexibly to distinctive ruralities, as well as the scope for developing greater 'joined-up' policy making at the point of implementation. These agendas also present a considerable challenge to the management and evaluation of public policy: objectives have multiplied, become more nuanced, yet may not always be straightforwardly compatible. Thus, policymakers and evaluators alike are being compelled to find new ways of deliberating tradeoffs, as well as constructing coherence in policymaking and delivery processes among different policy actors and sectors. Policy evaluation is playing an important, yet problematic role in this search for coherence, and this paper reports on the application of a policy appraisal methodology (the 'Cardiff Methodology') to two complex sets of issues facing rural Scotland: the scope for making schemes of public assistance to rural land uses more streamlined, more participative and conditional on compliance with other regulatory requirements; the compatibility of current and emerging transport policies with rural development objectives. The methodology seeks to support the deliberation of issues lying at the interface between sectoral policy objectives, and focuses on identifying the scope for action at the Scottish level in respect of these issues. The paper concludes with some interim findings about the utility and application of the policy evaluation methodology, and considers some wider implications for this new 'evaluation paradigm' in rural governance.

AB In view of soil fertility problems and financial constraints identified in small-scale farming, on-station investigations on Low-Extertial-lnput and Sustainable Agriculture (LEISA) were started by the Farming Systems Research Team Luapula province (FSRT-LP) in order to assess the potential of three annual and six perennial pasture legume species for green manuring purposes, Rhodes grass (Chloris gayana cv NIRS Boma) was used as a control. Over two seasons, a pasture legume-maize rotation trial was established. Different mineral fertilizer amounts were applied to the maize. Of all the species and cultivars tested. the perennial glycine (,(Neonotonia wightii cv Cooper) had the strongest green manure effect when no mineral fertilizer was applied. Of the annual pasture legumes, sunn hemp (Crotalaria juncea cv. NIRS 3) and velvet bean (Mucuna pruriens cv. NIRS 16) showed the greatest green manure potential at zero mineral fertilizer level. There were strong indications that the carbon: nitrogen ratio influenced the green manure potential of a species more than its ability to produce biomass. The need to assess the economics and sustainability of current mineral fertilizer practices on maize has been identified.

DT Article
AB The participatory approach of Farmer Research Groups (FRGs) was used in Farmer Adaptation of Starter Technology (FAST) with small-scale farmers in Luapula Province, Zambia. The introduction of a starter technology, proved to be a suitable method to induce self-help initiatives with farmers. Their first move in FAST related to the improvement of food security and income generation by the cultivation and marketing of new maize (Zea mays) varieties in wetlands during the dry and early rainy seasons. By informal on-farm seed multiplication the expenditure on external agricultural inputs was reduced. The technical aspects of the starter technology began with the integration of pasture legumes as a pioneer crop for green manuring purposes in maize production, In this respect, FRGs developed individual risk-aversion strategies to ensure early planting of the maize with the onset of the rains. The groups made adaptations such as biomass transfer, intercropping and crop rotations in order to integrate pasture legumes into current cropping systems for green manuring purposes.

ID BARLEY; GROWTH
AB A field experiment to evaluate the effect of N, K and time of K application on the growth, yield and chemical composition of wheat (Triticum aestivum) grown in saline soil with subsurface drainage, was conducted at the Central Soil Salinity Research Institute, Karnal Research Farm, Sampla during the winter seasons of 1992-93 to 1994-95. The treatments consisted of three levels each of N (0, 120 and 150 kg ha(-1)) and K (0, 50 and 75 kg ha(-1)) with the K applied at two different times (full basal and half basal + half top dressed 30 d after sowing). The growth characteristics (plant height, number of tillers and dry matter weight m(-2) recorded at 60 d after sowing) and yield-attributing parameters (number of productive tillers and length of spikes) increased significantly with increasing N levels up to 150 kg ha(-1) and K levels up to 50 kg ha(-1). Similar responses of N and K were also observed on grain and straw yields or wheat. Time of K application had no significant effect on growth and yields. The N concentration in grain and straw increased significantly with the application of 120 kg N ha(-1) over control. Application of K had no significant effect On the concentration of N in grain and straw. The K concentration in grain and straw increased significantly due to the application of 50 kg K ha(-1) but it was unaffected by the time of K application. Application of K increased the efficiency of utilization of applied N. A trend towards declining salinity of the soil profile due to leaching through the subsurface drainage system was observed From 1992-93 to 1994-95. For three consecutive years the status of available N and K in surface soil (0-30 cm depth) increased due to their respective applications.
   This field study indicates that 150 kg N and 50 kg K ha(-1) should be applied under canal-irrigated conditions to get the sustainable and optimum yield of wheat in saline soils.

AB Venezuela's logging history is poorly documented, although this country is endowed with one of the largest tracts of forests in Latin America, In this paper, wt: reviewed the history of natural forest management (NFM) in the western plains where commercial logging began as early as 1920. In the first few decades. logging was highly selective, focusing on mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla) and cedar (Cedrela odorata), From the 1950s until recent times, saqui-saqui (Bombacopsis quinata) was the most important timber species not only in the study area but also for all of Venezuela. Early logging was based on annual permits, resulting in the eventual conversion of natural forests into pasture. In the 1950s and 1960s, the Venezuelan government set aside four permanent forest estates (PFEs; covering ca. 1 Mio ha) in the study area to sustain timber production. However, NFM under long-term lease contracts (up to 40 years) did not commence until 1970. Conventional logging operations, removing all valuable timber species above the legal size, leave a highly damaged residual stand. Growth modelling suggests that the anticipated 30-yr cutting cycles do not provide sustainable yields under the current logging regime. On suitable sites, teak (Tectona grandis) is a promising species for monocultures. Due to the invasion of landless farmers, the area of PFEs has declined to some 250 000 ha (230 000 ha logged or unlogged forest, 20 000 ha monocultures). The remaining forest can only be preserved as timber production area if: (1) NFM is improved, (2) underpricing of forest resources is surmounted, and (3)disparity in land tenure and the trend to extensifying agriculture is overcome.

ID LANDSCAPE; EFFICIENCY
AB Consequences for net present value, net income and hat-vest related to 'sustainable forest management regimes' at non-industrial forest owner level in Norway are discussed. The following indicators of a sustainable forest management have been analysed: existing old forest set aside for preservation, maintaining minimum target levels for area covered by old forest through time, restricted treatments for border zone areas around water bodies, retention of trees at final harvest and restricted options with respect to regeneration. The consequences were analysed according to individual as well as co-operative management for eight different properties. GAYA-JLP, a large scale forestry scenario model applying simulations and linear programming, was used for the calculations. A regime with a 'medium' intensity of the environmentally oriented constraints, and a real rate of discount of 2.5%, reduced the net present values by 8% to 20%. The results indicated that the consequences for individual properties might vary considerably if the regimes for a sustainable forestry are designed generally without considering the heterogeneity among the properties with respect to the initial forest state. Assuming co-operative management, the net present value of the entire forest area (all properties) increased. At the same time it was possible to increase, respectively, the proportion of old forest set aside for preservation and the area covered by old forest through time. The differences compared with individual management were relatively small for all these parameters, and most likely not large enough to cover up for the transaction costs related to co-operative management. Whether the gains of co-operation will exceed transaction costs, can probably only be answered through cost-benefit analyses of the actual project. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

DE certification of sustainable forest management; scenario analysis;
   forest sector simulation model; Western Europe
AB In the international discussion on labels for sustainably produced wood products based on the certification of sustainable forest management (SFM), little attention has been paid to what is probably the most crucial part of any market-based instrument: the potential impact on forest products markets. This paper analyses the potential impact of SFM-certification on forest products markets using a simulation model of the Western European forest sector. Two scenarios with assumptions regarding certification (chain-of-custody costs, timber supply reduction from certified forests) are projected for the period 1995-2015 and tested against the results of a base scenario ('business as usual'). In general, the results show that rather modest changes are to be expected from SFM-certification in forest products markets. The market impact of a timber supply reduction from certified forest would be more distinct than the impacts of chain-of-custody costs. Industry gross profits would decrease more than production. Due to the large share of roundwood costs in total costs, the sawmill industry would be affected more by even small changes in raw-material prices than the panel and paper industry.

AB Significant expansion has occurred in Ireland's forest estate since the 1950s. However, the design of the monocultural plantations established in the 1950s and 60s is now considered insensitive to local landscapes and re-design intervention and transformation is needed to improve integration into the environment. This case study was carried out in Laracus forest, Co. Donegal. The rotation of all stands in this 581-ha property has reached the final production phase, with coupes scheduled for clearfelling from 2003 to 2015. The implications of forest re-design for both the volume production in the current rotation and the financial return of the current and subsequent rotations were examined. Results indicated a volume loss due to design planning for the current rotation of 5.6% compared to the volume produced under the standard regime. In financial terms, this represents a loss of 4.6%. For the subsequent rotation, a significant financial gain of 22% in net present value was achieved as a result of redesigning the plantation. The overall financial out-turn for the property, when both the current and subsequent rotations were considered, was a 3.4% lower net present value for the design plan than for the standard regime. This result represents a lower impact of design planning in Laracus than most other forest restructuring studies have reported. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Issue network analysis techniques were applied to the issue of sustainable forestry in the United States to identify potential public and private outcomes for the issue. A quantitative approach based on work by Laumann and Knoke [The Organizational State (1987)] was utilized in conjunction with the Delphi method. Results suggest that the parity in the distribution of influence among network sectors means that moving the issue of sustainable forestry onto the formal policy agenda will require more consensus on problems and solutions than exists at the present time. Accordingly, broad policy actions resulting from the expansion of the issue of sustainable forestry are unlikely in the short-term. However, experts on the Delphi panel anticipate that changes will occur in response to sustainability issues. At the federal and state level, this is likely to result in changes to public forest management and to the objectives assigned to the USDA Forest Service and to the state forestry agencies. States are projected to draft new and to change old private forest practices regulations as a result of sustainable forestry concerns. In the private sector, the trend of applying criteria and indicator-based sustainable forestry management standards and certification programs will continue. Non-industrial private forest owners are projected to make the fewest direct accommodations. Finally, where directly comparable, the Delphi study's results were not significantly different from the quantitative approach, suggesting that Delphi has promise for network research applications.

AB Commercial forestry is an important industry in South Africa, generating considerable employment and foreign exchange. The industry has grown rapidly since World War II with active government support. However, since the beginning of the transition to democracy in 1991, there have been increasingly vociferous attacks on the industry regarding its urban and big-business bias and its role in damaging the environment. The transition to democracy has brought a change in the structure or make-up of its stakeholders/actor constellations and the dynamics of policy change. As a result, a new network of actors, or coalition, who have different and diverse expectations from the industry, has emerged. This network's primary goal is to monitor and control the environmental functions of commercial forestry, as opposed to the old network whose actors have believed, and continue to do so, that commercial forestry's primary goal is profit maximization. Thc tension between the two has generated conflicts and the need for a change in the policy and institutions to ensure the sustainability of the industry. In this article, this process of policy change is explained with the help of an advocacy coalition framework; and a set of policy guidelines that might defuse the tension between the two coalitions and set the industry on a sustainable path is briefly discussed.

DE ice storm; forest health; sustainability; growth; mortality; dbh classes
AB Detailed crown condition information, including numbers of broken branches greater than or equal to5 cin diameter, broken tops, and healthy branches, were recorded for 5434 living trees >9 cm dbh from 603 ten-basal-area-factor prism plots (three per forest stand) at 201 random points (stands) throughout the ice damage region of northern New York State. Twenty five percent of the sample stands had greater than or equal to 20% branch breakage. Bigtooth aspen, red oak, red maple, and white pine had the most break-age. Comparison of potential mortality of trees associated with greater than or equal to 75% ice damage (severe damage) to baseline (predicted) mortality to maintain the existing forest structure suggests that ice damage may alter the health of 18% of the forest stands but this is not sufficient to alter the health (sustainability) of the larger forest system.

SO GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS
LA English
DT Article
DE no-regrets; ecological modernisation; climate change; Australia
ID SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB This paper explores Australia's domestic response to the issue of climate change, and charts the evolution of 'no-regrets' as the guiding principle for policy development. The concept of no-regrets encapsulates the ecologically modern idea that addressing environmental problems can bring economic, as well as social and environmental, benefits. It is argued that the degree of reconciliation between environmental and economic objectives achieved has been made possible through a progressive narrowing of the scales over which costs and benefits are weighed, and the exclusion of the non-material benefits of the environment. Tensions between addressing climate change and continuing business as usual, which are far from unique to Australia, remain and continue to limit effective reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.

TI Implementation from above: The ecology of power in Sweden's
   environmental governance
SO GOVERNANCE-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper seeks to assess the tenability of Rhodes' view of the "new governance" as "governing without government," as well as the validity of Pierre and Peters' assertions that the state is still at the center of structures and processes of governance. The case used for analysis is Sweden's ecological modernization and the implementation of Local Investment Programs for Sustainable Development. This case provides a crucial test of the contradictory propositions of Rhodes and Pierre and Peters. Contrary to Rhodes' assertions, central government held the initiative in the process of implementing Sweden's ecological modernization. In line with the arguments of Pierre and Peters, central government created new structures and processes of governance to keep its initiative over constitutionally independent expert agencies and municipal governments-exactly those actors that, in Rhodes' view, could make central governmental steering well nigh impossible. As the paper illustrates, what government gains in direct control over the process, it may well lose in terms of the end results. The case of "new governance" analyzed here thus directs attention to the critical interplay between structure, process, and the end results, and to government's role in governance.

TI Comparison of continuous and cyclic pumping from a well

LA English
DT Article
AB Two practically applicable pumping patterns for wells are: (1) continuous pumping at a sustainable constant rate; and (2) pumping at a sustainable constant rate for a fixed period every day (cyclic pumping). Theoretical analysis shows that with the cyclic pumping pattern the pump can be run at a higher rate than with continuous pumping. However continuous pumping at the maximum continuously sustainable constant rate produces considerably more water. If the objective is to produce as much water as possible, it is important to use a pump designed for running at the maximum continuously sustainable rate.

AB The Southern Extension and Research Activities/Information Exchange Group-27 (SERA/IEG-27) is sponsored by the Southern Association of Agricultural Experiment Station Directors. Thirteen universities and the U.S. National Arboretum cooperate with official representatives from extension and research programs. The objective of the group is to identify, evaluate, select, and disseminate information on superior, environmentally sustainable, landscape plants for nursery crop production and landscape systems in the southeastern U.S. Plants are distributed to members responding to a request from cooperators for plant evaluation. Those who agree to cooperate are expected to grow the selected liner to landscape size, then transplant it in a landscape setting. The plant is rated for insect, disease, and cold damage, heat stress, growth rate, ornamental flowering and fruiting, fall color, commercial production potential, landscape potential, invasiveness potential, and insect disease transmission potential. Growth rate is evaluated annually by recording plant height and width. Initial bloom date is reported followed by bloom duration in days. Following evaluation, the group collectively and individually disseminates information gained from the plant evaluation system to a wide variety of audiences.

AB The Ohio State University (OSU) Extension Nursery, Landscape, and Turf Team (ENLTT) is an innovative and interdisciplinary team comprised of extension agents, extension specialists, researchers, teaching faculty, university arboretum staff, and research assistants. ENLTT has greatly improved the process of acquisition, delivery, and support of accurate, practical, and timely educational resources through interdisciplinary and industry partnerships. The award-winning weekly electronic newsletter Buckeye Yard and Garden Line (BYGL) has been the focal point of our teamwork since 1993. An ornamental research circular, authored and edited by ENLTT members, remains the most requested publication from the Section of Communication and Technology, Ohio Agricultural Research Development Center, OSU. Strong partnership with the green industry in Ohio has resulted in the financial commitment of more than $230,000 from the Ohio Nursery and Landscape Association since 1993. ENLTT members have improved themselves as a result of educating each other through weekly BYGL conference calls from April to October, taking study tours, and conducting joint educational programs. Twenty-two commodity or issue teams, such as, Floriculture Team, Vegetable Crops Team, Tree Fruit Team, Forestry Team, Agronomic Crops Team, Sustainable Agriculture Team, and Dairy Team, have been formed in OSU Extension due to the success of ENLTT.

AB The introduction of the short-necked clam Tapes philippinarum into the Sacca di Goro has over a short period made this coastal environment one of the top European clam production sites. In recent years, this activity has been seriously impacted due to the appearance in the lagoon of large macroalgal beds and the occurrence of dystrophic events causing anoxia and massive deaths of molluscs in the cultivated areas.
   Tapes cultivation sites now cover more than one third of the lagoon surface at densities sometimes attaining 2000-2500 adult individuals m(-2); such densities and the harvesting methods, based on sediment dredging, probably have a strong impact on the benthic system. Whilst a number of studies have reported water-sediment interface induced modifications due to oyster or mussel farming there have been few attempts to quantify how clam farming affects biogeochemical cycles of oxygen and nutrients, in particular in the Sacca di Goro. Two areas, a farmed and a control one, were compared for benthic fluxes and results were correlated with clam biomass. Oxygen, carbon dioxide, ammonium, reactive silica and phosphorus fluxes were stimulated several fold by the presence of Tapes due to the clams, respiration and excretion activities, but also to the reducing conditions in the surface sediments. On average, the whole lagoon dark sediment O-2 demand and CO2 production were stimulated by a factor of, respectively, 1.8 and 3.3, whilst nutrient release was 6.5 times higher for NH4+ and 4.6 times higher for PO43-. Our results indicate that clam farmers should carefully consider sustainable densities of Tapes in order to prevent the risk of sediment and water anoxia. Rapid nutrient recycling (up to 4000 mumol NH4+ m(-2) h(-1) and 150 mumol PO43- m(-2) h(-1)) stimulated by the high biodegradability of clam faeces and pseudofaeces could in turn favour macroalgal growth.

AB Due to the connection-oriented nature of the asynchronous transfer mode (ATM), one of the challenges in mobile wireless ATM (WATM) systems is the management of terminal handovers. When ATM connections are reestablished to follow terminals moving between areas covered by distinct base stations, seamless handover protocols are necessary to guarantee that ATM cells are delivered to terminals in the correct order, with cell loss rate and delay that satisfy the contracted quality of service (QoS). A promising approach to meet QoS requirements is based on the use of handover buffers at the (destination) base station, where transmitted cells are stored while the connection is being reestablished. Up to date, only simulation and experimental results are available to determine the performance of such protocols and buffering schemes. This paper presents the first attempt to develop an analytical modeling approach to estimate the performance of handover protocols making use of handover buffers at the base station. By incorporating several approximations, the proposed models allow designers to simultaneously take into account numerous system parameters, including handover buffer size, sustainable and peak cell rates of the ATM connection, terminal offered load, and time needed to reestablish the ATM connection. Analytical performance predictions are shown to closely match results of detailed simulation experiments, thus demonstrating the suitability of the proposed modeling framework for the selection of the most adequate solution to handle handover and provide the QoS required by end users.

AB The blue crab Callinectes sapidus fishery in Maracaibo Lake, Venezuela is described and the stock is assessed by biomass dynamic models. This fishery is regionally important due to the number of jobs created in resource extraction and processing and export earnings obtained. Catch in metric tons and catch per unit of effort (CPUE) in kg/trap cover the period 1984-1997. During this time total catches have varied between 2000 mt in 1996 and around 5400 mt in 1994. Fishing effort has increased constantly from 70000 traps in 1984 to more than 270000 traps in 1997. This has resulted in a marked reduction in CPUE from slightly less than 50 kg/trap in 1985 to less than 10 kg/trap in 1996. Data analysis by biomass dynamic models resulted in a Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) of approximately 3800 mt with a corresponding effort of around 140000 traps. Confidence intervals for MSY at the 95% level were between 3650 and 4100 mt for the process error model and between 3400 and 4300 mt for the observation error model. Catch and effort levels in recent years are exceedingly high and must be reduced to avoid over-fishing and allow for increasing resource biomass levels.

TI A design methodology for the strategic assessment of a product's

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB The growing number of manufactured products has given rise to an alarming increase in the volume of industrial waste that is threatening the environment. However, if the various stages of a product are designed to be environmentally sustainable, ecological damage can be minimized, if not eliminated. This paper discusses a methodology that scores the cost, quality and environmental standing of four stages of the life cycle of a product. This is achieved through eight indices, or metrics, which depict the environmental standing of the product. The eight indices cover product cost, product reliability, serviceability and product retirement, among others. A self-learning algorithm is discussed that computes the best and worst values of the indices from a variety of similar products. This enables the designer to build up a comprehensive database of environmental data of a product. When displayed in a radar chart, the indices allow the environmental standing of a product to be quickly assessed, or compared with competitor designs. To emphasize their relative importance, weights may be assigned to the indices. Four case studies are presented and discussed. In the case of the injection-moulded multi-purpose holder, it was found that its reliability could be improved at the expense of manufacturability and retirement options. The eco-indices of 15 specimens of telecommunications paging devices, 13 amp 3-pin electrical plugs and 360 ml moulded drinking cups were computed and plotted on a radar chart. Overall, the analyses revealed that the five models of telecommunications pagers were not designed for end-of-life disposal and that the eco-efficiency of the electrical plugs depended on their country of manufacture, the ones made in the West being more environmentally benign. The drinking cups, on the other hand, illustrate the relative impact of different materials on the environment. The methodology can potentially benefit product designers, manufacturing engineers, sales/marketing personnel, in fact, all who have vested interests in environmentally friendly product design.

TI Regional development and planning: The story of a collaboration
SO INTERNATIONAL REGIONAL SCIENCE REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
ID GOVERNANCE
AB This article takes a critical look at the collaboration between William Alonso and John Friedmann in compiling two early collections of readings on regional development and planning. Important as these volumes were at the time they appeared (1964 and 1975), helping to delineate a new field of study, the world has changed. Metropolitan regions have moved into the foreground of interest, and there is now a much greater concern with questions of environmental sustainability, technological innovations, and the consequences of spatial restructuring in advanced economies. But pulling materials together on these new topics represents a formidable task.

TI Water use, yield and fruit quality of lysimeter-grown apple trees:
   responses to deficit irrigation and to crop load
SO IRRIGATION SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
ID BRAEBURN APPLES; HARVEST
AB Effective irrigation scheduling for maximum crop yield and quality in a sustainable environment requires a good understanding of crop water use in relation to crop load and soil water availability. This study determined tree water use (TWU), fruit growth, yield, and quality of 'Braeburn' apple grown in lysimeters in response to two irrigation regimes and two crop loads in the growing season of 1997/1998. The irrigation regimes tested were control level of irrigation (CI) and deficit irrigation (DI) and the crop loads were commercial crop load (CCL) and light crop load (LCL) which was equivalent to 60% of the CCL. Tree water use was measured using two methods: soil-water balance through lysimetry and by a heat-pulse technique. There was no significant interaction between irrigation and crop load treatments and therefore only results for the main effects, irrigation and crop load, are presented. DI and LCL reduced TWU. Higher stomatal conductance (g(s)) was responsible for the higher TWU in CI but not in CCL. Increased mean fruit weight but decreased gross yield was observed in LCL. DI reduced mean fruit weight but had no significant effect on gross yield. Fruit quality, in terms of flesh firmness, total soluble solids and dry matter. concentration, was improved in DI both at harvest and after 12 weeks of cold storage but was, generally, not affected by crop load.

AB In villages in Keerqin Sand Land, Inner Mongolia, China, desertification has been progressing severely for 30-40 years, resulting in poverty of the livestock farmers. A demonstration study has been carried out to increase the income and raise the villagers' living standard through the prevention of desertification and the development of integrated farming combining animal husbandry and agriculture. Guidance on farm management was given to farmers in 5 model farms. In addition, Japanese voluntary helpers (JVH) have attempted to fix the moving sand dunes in close collaboration with the villagers to motivate the farmers to promote afforestation. Results of surveys on the development of these model farms and the effects of JVH work are as follows: 1) Development of model farms Effects of fences on model farms were so remarkable for controlling overgrazing that farmers harvested a large amount of hay. Since the production of maize, soybeans and rice with irrigation was successful, farmers obtained a high yield of grain which was consumed in their homes, sold to the market or used as feed for the animals. Consequently, the income of the model farmers was 3-5 times higher than that of the average village farmers. 2) Collaboration for the establishment of the "village forests" Collaboration was extended for the establishment of village forests, which were completed in 1998, and planting of apricot gardens began in 1999. 3) New land use system Reform on the land use system was promoted to utilize pastures collectively. It is considered that the collaboration extended by the authors and JVH based on a farmer participatory system contributed to village development by fostering a "self-help" approach among the farmers. Strategies to prevent desertification and for rural development are presented.

AB An analysis of consumer preferences for seafood labeled with information about environmental production attributes is introduced into the food labeling literature. International seafood ecolabeling programs have been proposed to create market-based incentives for fisheries managers to promote sustainable fisheries. We investigate differences in consumer preferences for ecolabeled seafood across the United States and Norway. Using a contingent-choice telephone survey of random households in each nation, a wide range of factors is found to influence consumers' likelihood of purchasing ecolabeled seafood. Consumer preferences differ by price premium, species, consumer group, and certifying agency. The effect of these factors often differs between the United States and Norway, suggesting heterogeneity in international reactions to seafood ecolabels.

AB Within their value chains of suppliers through customers, many businesses are becoming more aware of the environmental aspects and impacts of their organizations. Viewed as a continuum of behavior, business environmentalism can range from simply complying with the law to accepting and pursuing a goal of sustainable development. The point on the continuum at which an organization chooses to operate is reflected in its environmental mission, policies, and actions. Attributes of the various levels of behavior and classification of some organizational mission statements are examined in this paper.

TI Gray marketing as an alternative market penetration strategy for
   entrepreneurs: Conceptual model and case evidence

CT Annual Research Symposium on Marketing and Entrepreneurship
CY JUN   12, 1998-JUN 13, 1999
CL HONG KONG, PEOPLES R CHINA
ID MULTINATIONALS
AB Gray marketing is said to occur when authentic branded products reach the consumer through marketing channels other than that of the authorized distributor (Weigand 1991). Free-riding was first of offered by Tan ct al. (1995, 1997) as an alternative explanation for the occurrence of gray marketing We extend the authors' work to show that free-riding can be an alternative strategy to niching for entrepreneurs contemplating entry into established markets.
   Almost exclusively, the existing literature on gray marketing treats the phenomenon as a pricing problem and fails to recognize it as a market entry opportunity for start-up entrepreneurs. The gray marketing strategy is appropriate for start-up entrepreneurs in view of their their resource limitations and the risk of being a first-mover in market development. We show in this paper that an entrepreneur can successfully penetrate an established market by following a gray marketing strategy. This is because it can be optimal for the incumbent supplier to accommodate the entrepreneur/gray marketer if the former could force the latter out of the market through aggressive counter actions.
   We developed a conceptual model using game theoretic concepts to aid entrepreneurs in understanding the strategic interactions amongst parties involved in gray marketing and to identify the conditions under which entrepreneurs can successfully penetrate a market via gray marketing. The deductive or game theoretic approach, we feel, is most appropriate because gray marketing involves multiple-party inter-actions and conflicts of interests. As Moorthy (1985) showed, the game theoretic methodology is most suited to analyzing the behavior of market participants in such a situation.
   This paper identifies the conditions under which gray marketing would be profitable and sustainable for entrepreneurs. First, by targeting markets that are already well established by the larger firms, the entrepreneurs' risk of failure due to demand uncertainty is reduced. In addition, they need not incur substantial costs for market developmental efforts. Furthermore, the free-riding strategy provides entrepreneurs with the opportunity to enter profitable markets that are currently supplied by larger firms, instead of being restricted to markets ignored or distained by the latter. Second, entrepreneurs are able to benefit from the second-mover advantages in following the free-riding strategy. As late entrants into the market, entrepreneurs could learn from the experiences of the larger firms and avoid costly mistakes. By imitating the product strategy of the larger firm, entrepreneur's could also achieve cost savings in R&D and product development costs. All these effectively reduce the entrepreneur's cost of entry into the market. Hence, even with limited resource at their disposal, entrepreneurs could still enter the market successfully. Finally, by following the free-riding strategy, entrepreneurs are able to "nibble" at the market shares of the larger firms. This is possible because of the difficulties and costs faced by the larger firms in countering entries made by the entrepreneurs. Thus, the larger-firms are left with little choice but to accommodate the entry of the entrepreneurs into the market. When the costs of countering the entrepreneurs' entry are sufficiently large, the free-riding strategy becomes feasible for entrepreneurs even if they do not posses competitive advantages over the larger-firms.
   Our paper thus demonstrates that entrepreneurs do have an alternative market entry strategy besides the commonly prescribed niching strategy. It also shows them when such a free-riding strategy would be most benificial and most likely to succeed. These are further illustrated and supported through two real-life cases involving companies in the luxury cars and cosmetics industries in Singapore. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

TI 'An amateur learns his job'? Special operations Executive in Portugal,
   1940-42
SO JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY HISTORY
LA English
DT Article
AB During the first years of its existence, Special Operations Executive looked to neutral Europe as an area in which it could deploy its limited resources against German interests with a reasonable chance of success. By early 1942, however, it was clear that neutral Europe had failed to live up to SOE's expectations. Most of SOE's plans had either been aborted or cancelled. This article examines SOE's work in Portugal between early 1941 and summer 1942. During this period, SOE not only failed to achieve any of its objectives but also suffered the indignity of having its station in Lisbon exposed by the Portuguese and was ultimately forced to withdrawn its officer from the country. The article argues that SOE's lack of success was due not so much to the practical difficulties it encountered int he field, or even the opposition of other departments in Whitehall, which did so much to blight its operations elsewhere in Europe, but to its failure to create a sustainable role within British political and military policies towards Portugal.

AB Biomass integrated gasification-gas tui-bine (BIG-GT) technology offers the opportunity for efficient and enviioizmeiltally sound power generation from biomass fuels. Since biomass is "carbon-neutral" it can be used in power generation equipment without contributing to the "greenhouse effect" if it is grown sustainably. The Bi-azilian BIG-GT initiative is one of a number of initiatives world-wide aimed at demonstrating, and thereby establishing, biomass as an energy resource for power production. The goal of the Brazilian BIG-GT project is to confirm the commercial viability of producing electricity from wood through the use of biomass-fueled integrated gasification combined-cycle (BIG-GT) technology. To fulfil this goal a 32 MWe eucalyptus-fueled demonstration power plant will be built in Brazil on the basis of a design made by TPS Termiska Processer AB (TPS). The first two phases of the project, which included experimental and engineering studies and the basic engineering of the plant, were completed in 1997. The next phase of the project, the construction and commissioning of the plant, is the recipient of a U.S. $35 million grant from the Global Environmental Facility (GEF) of the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), in addition to financing from the World Bank (WB). The plant will be built in Bahia, north-eastern Brazil. The customer of the plant is a consortium, SER-Sistemas de Energia Renovavel, comprising of CHESF (Companhia Hidro Eletrica do Sao Francisco), a federally owned electricity generation and distribution company, Electrobras (Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras), a holding company comprising of the main Brazilian companies from the electric generation and distribution sector, and Shell Brasil. Start-lip of the plant is scheduled for the year 2000. The plant will be based on a TPS designed atmospheric-pressure gasification/gas cleaning process. The product gas will be fired in a modified GE LM 2500 gas turbine. The gasification and gas cleaning process is based on the use of a circulating fluidized bed gasifier secondary stage catalytic tar cracker and conventional cold filter and wet scrubbing technology. The feedstock to the plant will be mainly eucalyptus wood from a dedicated plantation which is harvested on a three-year cycle. This paper describes the background of the project leading lip to the technology selection, the technology that will be employed in the plans and the outline of the economics of this "first-of-a-kind" plant. The progress made in establishing the organization and the formal framework (e.g., securing the electricity and fuel con tracts) are also reported. Future projections of likely technological improvements and cost reductions, and their effect on the over all economics of an N-th plant, are presented.

TI Analysis of irrigation systems using sustainability-related criteria
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY

DT Article
AB Sustainable agricultural development as a desired goal in irrigation management is a result of recent public awareness of the scarcity of water for food production. In order to incorporate sustainability-related criteria in the analysis of irrigation systems, the present study aims at introducing environmental indices that represent irrigation water conservation and satisfactory production and income for farmers under stress conditions. An experiment was conducted in Chania, Greece, during the irrigation periods of 1989 and 1990. The irrigation water delivered to 40 experimental plots and the relevant soil moisture content at the root zone were recorded. The data, collected in real time, were used for the calculation of the corresponding environmental indices. The variation of indices in time and space was high, and demonstrated that up to 13% of water was delivered to crops, 82% was yield loss, and 84% was economic return. The study indicated that environmental indices could be easily computed by means of routinely collected data, and could also be incorporated into decision-making approaches, such as compromise programming, in order to develop policies for irrigation water allocation.

AB The relationships between N fertilizer rate, yield, and NO3 leaching need to be quantified to develop soil and crop management practices that are economically and environmentally sustainable. From 1996 through 1999, we measured yield and NO3 loss from a subsurface drained field in central lowa at three N fertilizer rates: a low (L) rate of 67 kg ha(-1) in 1996 and 57 kg ha(-1) in 1998, a medium (M) rate of 135 kg ha(-1) in 1996 and 114 kg ha(-1) in 1998, and a high (H) rate of 202 kg ha(-1) in 1996 and 172 kg ha(-1) in 1998. Corn (Zea mays L.) and soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] were grown in rotation with N fertilizer applied in the spring to corn only. For the L treatment, NO3 concentrations in the drainage water exceeded the 10 mg N L-1 maximum contaminant level (MCL) established by the USEPA for drinking water only during the years that corn was grown. For the M and H treatments, NO3 concentrations exceeded the MCL in all years, regardless of crop grown. For all years, the NO3 mass loss in the drainage water from the H treatment (48 kg N ha(-1)) was significantly greater than the mass losses from the M (35 kg N ha(-1)) and L (29 kg N ha(-1)) treatments, which were not significantly different. The economically optimum N fertilizer rate for corn was between 67 and 135 kg ha(-1) in 1996 and 114 and 172 kg ha(-1) in 1998, but the net N mass balance indicated that N was being mined from the soil at these N fertilizer levels and that the system would not be sustainable.

DE social-economic-natural complex ecosystem (SENCE); ecosystem model;
   sustainable development
AB There is a need to find a comprehensive approach focusing on the conflicts between economical growth and environmental protection. Chinese scholars advocate a comprehensive ecosystem viewpoint named social-economic-natural complex ecosystem(SENCE). The kernel of the concept lies in the hierarchical structure of SENCE, through which methods from ecological network can be useful to the compound system. The author gives a schema depicting its structure, following a made analysis to help understand the reliance of economy on ecosystem. It is obvious that more actions should be done to strive for sustainable development.

AB Western Siberia's forests cover nearly 75 million hectares and contain roughly 10 percent of the world's growing stock of nontropical wood fiber; more than half of these forests are undeveloped old-growth. The development of oil, gas, and other mineral resources and an inefficient forest economy pose a significant threat to the sustainability of these ecosystems, and climatic factors limit forest productivity. But with improvements in forest management, resource protection, and investments in the wood industry, Western Siberia can make a significant contribution to global carbon sequestration and industrial wood supply in this new century.

AB Uruguay, a country with very little natural forest, has a small but increasingly important forest industry based on afforesting prairies with nonindigenous species, mainly flooded gum (Eucalyptus grandis) blue gum (Eucalyptus globulus), and loblolly pine (Pinus taeda). Internal and external forces make forest expansion a plausible scenario. For these forests to be certified for sustainability, however, several environmental problems need to be addressed and research performed to gather data on pesticides, water use, flora and fauna, soil changes, and social and economic impacts.

TI Integrating soil solarization with grafting on resistant rootstocks for
   management of soil-borne pathogens of eggplant
SO JOURNAL OF HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE & BIOTECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID TOMATO
AB Soil solarization and grafting onto a resistant tomato rootstock ('Brigeor F1'), and the integrated use of both methods were evaluated in four field trials carried out in Cyprus, for management of soil-borne pathogens and pests of eggplant. Soil solarization was highly effective against Verticillium wilt (V. dahliae) but only partially effective against corky root rot (Pyrenochaeta lycopersici) and root-knot nematodes (Meloidogyne spp.); it also controlled adequately most annual weeds. By contrast, grafting provided complete protection from corky root rot and root-knot, but only partial protection from Verticillium wilt. Complete resistance to nematodes, however, occurred only in trials with greenhouse-grown (winter) crops. In open-field (summer) crops, about 50% of the grafted plants sustained slight nematode infection, apparently because of breakdown of resistance at high soil temperatures. Solarization, or grafting gave significant yield increases over that of the untreated check. However, a combination of both was much more effective than either alone. Together, they provided complete protection from all three diseases. Most importantly, they had an additive effect on yield, resulting in a significant increase over that obtained by either method alone. The average yield (kg plant(-1)) obtained in two greenhouse trials was 9.5 for the control, 16.1 for grafting alone, 14.1 for solarization alone and 20.2 for the combination of the two methods. The integrated use of solarization and grafting appears to be a sustainable alternative to methyl bromide fumigation.

SO JOURNAL OF PROFESSIONAL ISSUES IN ENGINEERING EDUCATION AND PRACTICE

DT Article
AB This paper describes a method for presenting concepts of sustainable development to first-year civil engineering students using pedagogical techniques related to critical thinking development. Sustainable development is an emerging area of environmental management that is important to civil engineering students. The concept can be associated with most design-related projects. In addition, the development of students' abilities to think critically about engineering problems and design projects is an important educational objective. Explicit methods for developing students' critical thinking skills have been adapted for the first-year civil engineering curriculum. The development of critical thinking skills is combined with the coverage of sustainable development concepts in this approach. This combination was chosen because the issue of sustainable development exhibits many of the characteristics of ill-structured problems that require critical thinking. Therefore, the combination of critical thinking pedagogy and sustainable development concepts provides an important contribution to the future education of civil engineering students.

SO JOURNAL OF PROFESSIONAL ISSUES IN ENGINEERING EDUCATION AND PRACTICE
LA English
DT Article
AB The nation has achieved substantial progress over the past 30 years in improving environmental conditions throughout the United States. Civil engineers have played leadership roles in achieving this progress. Today, there is considerable discussion about the direction and means of achieving further environmental protection. Civil engineers have both an obligation and a right to participate in these discussions. But obligations and rights will not ensure that engineers exert leadership and a positive influence on these key policy discussions. The profession must take a close look at how it can most effectively participate in the policy debates that will shape the future of environmental policy. This paper examines the roles that civil engineers can play in formulation of environmental policy. It suggests that civil engineers build on their strengths of design of the environment grounded in physical science, by analyzing the entire environmental management system, thinking in terms of outcomes, and considering a broad range of alternatives. The paper suggests that civil engineers need to attend more closely to sustainable development and pollution prevention as substantive areas for engagement beyond the traditional design of waste treatment systems.

AB Structural anti-quality characteristics are physical plant traits that reduce the performance and productivity of herbivores and quality of their agricultural products. Most structural anti-quality characteristics of plants affect the rate at which herbivores gather and ingest forages, reducing the total amount of food obtained or increasing the time necessary to obtain food. Structural anti-quality can substantially influence searching time (e.g., plant crypticity, distribution), cropping time (e.g,, plant fibrousness, tensile and shear strength), and bite size (e.g., plant canopy structure, spinescence), Plant structural characteristics can also reduce digestion (e.g., silica), cause injury (e.g., spines, a,pns, burrs, calluses), or reduce the quality of animal products, such as wool (e.g., propagules), The effects of structural antiquality characteristics depend on the morphology of the herbivore, especially its size, the morphology of the focal plant, and their contest within the habitat. Integrated grazing management plans should consider options to reduce the negative effects of structural anti-quality. Carefully selecting appropriate livestock species with previous experience, and the appropriate season of grazing can minimize anti-quality on rangelands. Because structural anti-quality may actually promote sustainability of grazing systems by preventing severe defoliation, or by providing refuges for highly desirable forages, it may not be desirable to completely counteract their effects.

SO JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES

ID DEVELOPMENT RIGHTS; LAND-USE; BENEFITS
AB Rural population growth in the form of residential development frequently results in the loss of agricultural productive land as well as loss of adjacent open space that often characterizes rural communities. A land-use prediction model was used to determine what influence the USDA Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) may have on urban sprawl and rural community sustainability. The model demonstrated that the projected mean rural residential growth rate was almost half the growth rate with CRP as compared to without CRP in the local land management mix. In addition, ecosystem integrity on the land surrounding a rural community was sharply increased with the introduction of CRP. However, community economics and subsequent social character of the community may have been significantly impacted by CRP. In order to partially mitigate CRP-induced community impacts we propose future CRP guidelines support the establishment of within-production field scale ecological refuges. These refuges would satisfy the conservation requirements of the program, return a level of traditional agricultural production to the land management mix, and provide the adjacent community with aesthetic and recreational amenities that are frequently associated with modern rural economies.

AB Sustainable urban drainage systems offer a sustainable option for the disposal of stormwater runoff-reducing the risks of flooding and pollution of receiving watercourses. However, the adoption of such systems has been slow, with a lack of performance data identified as being one barrier. This paper presents in situ performance data from a perforated concrete ring soakaway which was installed to collect stormwater runoff from a school roof and paved area. Data on rainfall at the site and water depth in the soakaway were collected for a period of twenty months, and a number of rain events were studied in detail. Data from the soakaway were used to test the most recent design procedures for infiltration drainage systems, and it was found that the design equations gave reasonable predictions of system response to rainfall-especially when the observed runoff coefficients were taken into account.

AB The paper's aim is to discuss the strategic character of conditional access system as an essential element for entry, growth and maintenance in the digital TV services provision market. We present the implications for regulation of different conditional access schemas that agents can implement, which potentially include not only competition considerations but also the preservation of general interest, as well as the goal of ensuring a sustainable competition. This paper Is based on the Spanish experience, one of the first EU countries in regulate digital TV, that it has been a good example of attempting to regulate technical systems strongly connected to business strategies, by means of technical regulation instead of adopting a 'light-handed' approach. Currently, the scenario comprises two different digital satellite television platforms, a digital terrestrial television platform and different cable operators. All of them are competing and offering different products and services to their real customers. Thus, Spain is the best place to find what will happen in the future scenario of competence in contents that will spread across Europe.

DE life cycle assessment; life cycle inventory; sustainable development
AB The "Establishment of a Sustainable Society Based on Material Recycle" can be regarded as an issue urging a fundamental change in the values and social systems of the modern society and a challenge demanding a reform of the industrial structure from the conventional systems of individual optimization. This paper reports our views on LCA (Life Cycles Assessment) issues and on material selection, taking LCA of automobiles as an example, and challenges of Japanese steel industry on them.
   The LCA study on automobiles makes us aware of the significance of not only data itself but also the development of Life Cycle Aspect which tries to evaluate Life Cycle Cost and Function, etc.

AB The International Service for the Acquisition of Agribiotech Applications (ISAAA) is a not-for-profit organisation. The mission of ISAAA is to help alleviate poverty and hunger in the Third World by increasing crop productivity and income generation, particularly for resource-poor farmers, and to create a safer environment and promote more sustainable agricultural development. ISAAA's activities as an 'honest broker' involve the transfer of appropriate crop biotechnology applications and products, particularly proprietary technology, from the North for the benefit of developing countries in the South, by building partnerships between national programmes in the South and institutions in the North. In the past, developing countries and the institutes assisting them with agricultural research accessed non-proprietary traditional technology from the public sector in industrial countries. With the advent of biotechnology this situation is changing, because biotechnology applications are increasingly proprietary and are owned primarily by private sector corporations in industrial countries. The activities of ISAAA in brokering biotechnology applications are described as well as the support services it provides for national programmes in Africa, Asia and Latin America.

   South Africa; deforestation
AB In the post-apartheid era, South Africa is experiencing a serious water supply crisis as demand increases from both rural areas and rapidly growing towns and cities. New dams and water transfer schemes are being constructed, but they are both controversial and unlikely to fully satisfy demand. Alien species of trees and plants have invaded many parts of the country, taking over land from indigenous species. These alien species consume much more water than the indigenous vegetation, as well as threatening biodiversity and constituting a significant fire hazard. The Working for Water Programme, established in 1995, and working in partnership with local communities, aims to clear invasive alien species and thus increase water supply. The programme is examined in terms of its impact on environment and the livelihoods of predominantly poor rural communities. Questions are raised about the future sustainability of the programme.

AB Progress in catalytic olefin polymerization has led to the development of environmentally friendly and versatile polymeric materials which meet the demands of sustainable development and serve the needs of modem technologies. Polymer architectures and property profiles are tailored as a function of catalyst structures and process conditions. The scope of single site catalyst technology has been expanded well beyond that of metallocene-based systems to produce novel families of 1-olefin, styrene, diene and cycloolefin polymers, ranging from engineering plastics to flexible packaging and rubbers. Short- and long chain branches are introduced via copolymerization and "chain walking" in order to control polymer crystallization and polymer processing. Novel group 10 catalyst generations tolerate functional comonomers and afford aqueous polyethylene dispersions. Computer sciences, engineering and information technology are combined to exploit the potential of combinatorial chemistry and on-line monitoring in high-throughput catalyst and polymer development. Data mining tools track correlations ("fingerprints") between spectroscopic data, process parameters and catalyst as well as polyolefin properties, thus promoting high throughput development, modeling, rapid on-line analyses, as well as quality assurance. Selected recent advances are reviewed to highlight trends and opportunities in polyolefin science and technology.

AB The objective of this paper is to provide an overview of shrimp aquaculture from the perspectives of economics. It is offered as a contribution to the on-going policy debate on this globally important industry. The paper is organised into four sections: the benefits of shrimp aquaculture, the problems of shrimp aquaculture, economic development perspectives on shrimp aquaculture, and conclusions. Four main conclusions are drawn: there is a lack of independent analysis of the factors affecting the production strategies of private firms in the shrimp industry; there is a need to overcome polarisation in order to promote sustainable shrimp aquaculture; wider perspectives on shrimp aquaculture will be beneficial to policy formation; and it is in the long-run self-interest of shrimp producers to incorporate the external costs of production into planning decisions. The paper includes a review of the international literature which provides a valuable resource for policy-makers. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Purpose: The relationship between oxygen consumption and power is not linear. The purpose of this investigation was to examine the nature of the relationship and the cause of the nonlinearity. Methods: Eight male cyclists (60.5 +/- 3.8 mL O-2 min(-1 kg) VO2 peak) completed an incremental exercise test(1 W.5 s(-1)) to exhaustion. VO2 was measured every breath, and rmsEMG was recorded continuously over the belly of vastus lateralis, biceps femoris, and lateral gastrocnemius. Results: VO2 is a linear function of power in moderate exercise: the slope of the linear portion was similar to9.7 mt O-2 min(-1) W-1, which is consistent with the steady state gain for moderate exercise. Beyond this initial break from linearity, the VO2 W-1 plot demonstrates a second break that is not different from the point of respiratory compensation (break in V-E VCO2-1). These breaks were coincident with increased neuromuscular actiVity (1st break: 194 +/- 27 W for VO2, 191 +/- 25 W for vastus lateralis; 2nd break: 262 +/- 34 W for VO2, 258 +/- 27 W for vastus lateralis) and corresponded to approximately 58% VO2 peak for the first and 75% VO2 peak for the second break. Conclusions: VO2 is not a linear function of power. During an incremental test, neuromuscular activity and VO2, increase more rapidly in heavy exercise. Both VO2 and neuromuscular activity exhibit a second break at very high power output, which may mark an upper limit for sustainable exercise.

TI The sexual history provisions in the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence
   Act 1999 - A violation of the right to a fair trial?
SO MEDICINE SCIENCE AND THE LAW
LA English
DT Article
ID RAPE
AB In response to the Home Office recommendations contained in Speaking Up for Justice (1998) the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act (YJCEA) 1999 introduced a new regime for the conduct of sexual offence trials. Section 41 of the Act, which came into force on 4 December 2000, brings about dramatic changes to the rules on the admissibility of evidence of complainants' sexual behaviour, severely restricting the discretion of trial judges to introduce such evidence or to allow questioning concerning it. This represents a radical new departure that will fundamentally affect an accused's position at trial, Responses to section 41 have predictably been divided given the extremely sensitive nature of this area of the law of evidence and the complex set of social and political issues which are at stake. Many have greeted it as a long overdue reform of a system premised upon outmoded and sexist beliefs concerning women's sexual behaviour which has routinely functioned to admit prejudicial and irrelevant evidence. Others, predominantly within the legal profession, have expressed serious concerns over whether the new law is workable and the extent to which, by potentially excluding critically relevant evidence, it may infringe upon a defendant's right to a fair trial.
   The quality of the legislation is soon to be tested. On 26 and 27 March 2001 the House of Lords heard an interlocutory appeal in the case of R v. A and were asked to decide if the new provisions, by excluding previous sexual history evidence between the complainant and the defendant, contravened Article 6 of the European Convention of Human Rights. Their Lordships are, at the time of writing, yet to give judgment and the fate of the defendant in question, and several others whose trials have been postponed pending their decision, hangs in the balance. This article seeks to show that the new Act, despite being well-intentioned, does not adopt a coherent or sustainable approach to the relevance of previous sexual history evidence and the restrictive nature of its provisions are such that genuinely relevant material will be rendered inadmissible. This creates the risk of disembodying the case before the jury and raises the significant possibility that miscarriages of justice will occur. As a consequence, unless the legislation can be read down in such a way as to reintroduce a measure of judicial discretion to admit such evidence, a declaration of incompatibility may be called for.

AB Aiming at one of the decisive alternatives for long-term perspectives of the nuclear power. an integral and closed nuclear energy system concept is proposed; namely, the Advanced Molten-salt Break-even Inherently-safe Dual-missioning Experimental and Test Reactor (AMBIDEXTER) nuclear energy complex. This essentially comprises two mutually independent circuits of the radiation/material transport and the heat/energy conversion, centered at the integral reactor assembly, which enables one to utilize maximum benefits of nuclear energy under minimum risks of nuclear radiation. The entire reactor system resides in a thin and large Hastelloy vessel, the internal part of which is divided into a number of equipment compartments with neither connection pipings nor active valves necessary. As the reactor operates at very low FP inventory throughout its designed lifetime and there is no primary heat transport pipings outside the reactor vessel, significant release of radioactive materials due to any equipment failure should be incredible. The nuclear-thermalhydraulic characteristics of the molten ThF4-(UF4)-U-233 fuel salt extend the self-sustainability of the AMBIDEXTER fuel cycle to enhance the resource security and safeguard transparency. While maintaining the break-even conversion ratio criterion, a flexible fuel management strategy using a certain choice of denaturants should improve its own proliferation-resistance characteristics. As the core technologies associated with developing the AMBIDEXTER concept are mostly available in commercialized forms at present, investigating the integral performance of the concept should be the prime research topic in ongoing 250 MWth prototype design studies.

DE access to biodiversity; marine bioprospecting; marine scientific

AB Bioprospecting involves the collection of biological material for screening for commercially exploitable biologically active compounds or attributes, including genetic information. The authors assess the claim that bioprospecting has the potential to act as a sustainable carrot for biodiversity-rich states to conserve marine environments. They analyze the tensions between the international conventions that address bioprospecting in marine areas: the Biodiversity Convention and the Law of the Sea Convention. In particular, they reject any suggestion that there is a legal presumption in favor of coastal states granting access to marine bioprospectors. They argue that the different approaches taken by the marine scientific research provisions of UNCLOS to fundamental research and research with commercial potential is unrealistic because of the difficulties of drawing the distinction in practice. As a result, the danger is that scientific research will get caught in the hard bargaining increasingly associated with bioprospecting. The authors argue that coastal states will derive greater benefit from research collaborations rather than the distant prospect of winning the product royalty lottery.

AB In this paper dealing with the medium term (2020) and long term (2050) world energy mix the author has attempted to present a single most likely scenario, contrary to the usual multiple scenario approach. A second main characteristic is that the emphasis is not on the uncertainties of energy demand but on the potential limitations on the offer of fossil fuels and mainly of oil and gas. The main conclusions are that by 2050 we will need a large increase of the world nuclear industry, not only for the production of electricity but also to complement the oil industry, by providing it with necessary "CO2 emissions free" heat and hydrogen. This nuclear-based hydrogen would allow, to give a sustainable future to the oil industry, and to the automobile industry by providing synthesis fuels on an economically and ecologically sound basis.

TI Residual visual functions of guide dog owners in the UK
SO OPHTHALMIC AND PHYSIOLOGICAL OPTICS

DT Article
ID NORTHERN-IRELAND; IMPAIRMENT; PROFILE
AB Numbers of guide dog owners (GDOs) in the United Kingdom reached 4700 by the end of 1998. Despite this growing trend, little is known about the nature of their visual loss. This paper reports the results of a national three-centre investigation into the residual visual functions and ophthalmic conditions of guide dog owners. Random samples of GDOs (Scotland n = 82, England n = 77, and Northern Ireland n = 87) underwent a detailed visual analysis and interview. GDOs had an overall median age of 53 years. Nationally, they make up just 2.4% of the registered blind population. All GDOs were found to have profound loss of visual acuity, contrast sensitivity or visual fields, but only 43% were totally blind. GDOs in Scotland retained higher levels of residual visual function than those in the other two regions. The main causes of visual loss were congenital and early onset degenerative eye disease (retinitis pigmentosa 18%, optic atrophy 10%). Results taken in conjunction with epidemiological registration trends suggest that the past growth in numbers of GDOs is unlikely to be sustainable. Implications for mobility service providers are discussed. It is suggested that increased optometric input and a multidisciplinary approach could assist present and potential guide dog owners.

AB Birds form an important and conspicuous component of forest biodiversity in Africa and many rural communities closely interact with and use birds in many ways. People that draw benefits from birds have positive attitudes towards them and are therefore likely to initiate or participate in bird conservation projects. Favourable attitudes towards birds by the local people, however, have not been adequately translated into viable community-driven conservation initiatives in many areas. The factors that have contributed to this lack of inertia by local people are not well known. The purpose of this ethno-ornithological study was to assess indigenous knowledge, socio-economic and cultural values of birds, and how such information can be used to promote biodiversity conservation. The target communities were the Kikuyu and Marakwet peoples of central Kenya. The study was carried out in 1998 and 1999 and entailed administration of questionnaires, interviews and focussed discussion groups, which involved 211 persons drawn from different age and sex categories. The results of the study revealed that birds were an important resource to the Kikuyu and the Marakwet people but the two communities use birds differently. Children were more interested in birds than older people but their knowledge was shallow. Marakwet people used birds for a wider range of cultural purposes and had also deeper and wider knowledge of local birds than the Kikuyu people interviewed. In both communities, livestock and farm crops dominated the worldviews of individuals but birds, had special roles in the social and cultural life of the people regardless of their level of education. Knowledge of local wild birds by Kikuyu and Marakwet peoples appeared to be linked to the frequency of interactions and use of birds. This study showed that people that live in or near natural forests have immense ecological knowledge of local birds and their habitats. That indigenous knowledge is valuable and should be used in land use planning and sustainable conservation of biodiversity in Africa.

ID MANAGEMENT
AB Conservation of biological diversity ideally means conservation of entire ecosystems. To conserve ecosystems on a sustainable basis, you need to understand how they work. SYSTANAL is a checklist for analysing ecosystems, developed during years of fieldwork and lecturing on tropical land use, to help ensure that all the most important aspects of ecosystems are considered. This includes of course the role of people in ecosystems (and agro-ecosystems), and the various benefits an ecosystem may provide to people. SYSTANAL touches upon: (1) participative integrated natural resource management; (2) the need to know where you start from and where you want to go; (3) the need to first take the broad view to define problems in ecosystems, then a narrow view to find potential solutions, and then again the broad view to see whether these solutions fit into the ecosystem as a whole (hourglass approach); (4) delimitation of system boundaries; (5) already existing knowledge; (6) the need to analyse historical, and likely future, developments; (7) the involvement of stakeholders, and what they know and are able and willing to do; (8) production being dependent on (the interaction between) both genetic and environmental factors; (9) socio-economic benefits; (10) a systematic classification of all the environmental factors that can affect how plants or animals use the production factors; (11) the production factors essential for plant functioning, and animal functioning, whether these plants and animals are wild or domesticated; (12) the pros and cons of spatial and temporal variability in production factors and environmental factors; (13) off-site effects; (14) the need to be quantitative whenever possible; and (15) the five key aspects of sustainability.

AB Zinc deficiency is an important limiting factor in sustainable crop production and is a factor often overlooked in determining the benefits and overall success of alfalfa pastures in rotations. A field experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of zinc and alfalfa cultivars on nodulation, herbage yield, leaf drop and disease severity (Phytophthora root rot disease and common leaf spot disease) in alfalfa ( Medicago sativa L.). Ten cultivars of alfalfa (Hunter River, Hunterfield, Sceptre Aurora, Genesis, Aquarius, Venus (Y8622), PL69, P5929 and PL34HQ) were tested at two levels of zinc (+Zn: 4 kg ha(-1), -Zn: no zinc added) on a Zn-deficient soil (DTPA zinc of top 0-15 cm soil was 0.4 mg kg(-1) soil, while 15-30 cm subsoil Zn was 0.1 mg kg(-1) soil) under field conditions. Zinc application significantly increased number and dry weight of nodules, herbage yield and leaf to stem ratio of alfalfa plants. There was a significant reduction in leaf drop, and occurrence of Phytophthora root rot (caused by fungus Phytophthora megasperma f. sp. medicaginis) and common leaf spot (caused by fungus Pseudopeziza medicaginis) diseases with Zn application. Alfalfa cultivars had a differential response to low Zn. Hunter River and Hunterfield were the most affected by omitting zinc application, while Sceptre, PL34HQ and Aquarius were comparatively less affected. The present study suggest that Zn nutrition effects nodulation, leaf drop, disease occurrence and production potential of alfalfa. The alfalfa cultivars have differential ability to low Zn supply. Growing of Zn-efficient cultivars and adequate Zn nutrition may also improve the N(2)-fixation by alfalfa on low-Zn soils.

AB Shortgrass steppe rangeland near Nunn, Colorado, USA, has been lightly, moderately, or heavily grazed by cattle, or protected from grazing in exclosures, for 55 years. Plant species biodiversity and evenness were greatest in lightly- and moderately-grazed pastures. Both pastures were dominated by the warm-season shortgrass Bouteloua gracilis, but the cool-season midgrasses Pascopyrum smithii and Stipa comata contributed significantly to biomass production on the lightly-grazed pasture, as they did in the exclosures. Diversity was least in the exclosures, which were strongly dominated by the cactus Opuntia polyacantha. Buchloe dactyloides, another warm-season shortgrass, and Bouteloua gracilis were co-dominants under heavy grazing, and diversity was intermediate. Plant community structure and diversity were controlled by selective grazing by cattle and soil disturbance by cattle and rodents. Shortgrass steppe moderately or heavily grazed by cattle was similar to and probably as sustainable as steppe grazed for millenia by bison and other wild ungulates.

AB The British government's desire to tackle financial exclusion is resulting in growing interest in credit unions (community-based financial services cooperatives). This article draws on research undertaken in Scotland to analyse the credit union support network. There are tensions in this: between those who see credit unions as small, area-based poverty-alleviating initiatives and those who feel unions can only survive if they serve larger areas. By making comparisons with other initiatives, an attempt is made to put the current support framework in context. The article concludes by raising a number of issues that should be addressed if more support is to be given to unions: in particular the need to be clear about objectives and to understand the role that credit unions might realistically play in tackling financial exclusion.

ID SUSTAINABILITY
AB Growing globalization has changed the relationship between the economic institution 'market' and its social contexts. Local alternatives have developed, as some would argue, as a response to this globalization trend. This paper examines the seeming contradiction between globalization and local market developments by examining a recent model of emerging local, more socially embedded markets, namely CSAs (Community Supported Agriculture). It argues that CSAs, which directly link agricultural producers and consumers, exemplify the search for market alternatives that are re-embedded in their physical, social, and ethical context. Thereby important dimensions of market interaction such as reliance on local experts, social interaction, and spatial/temporal feedback functions can be recovered.

ID GASTROINTESTINAL PARASITISM
AB Focus on genetic resources and their management in ruminant species in the Caribbean. The present domestic ruminant species were shipped to the Caribbean after the 15th century. After the introduction of the first iberical stocks, the stocks proceeded from different origins, according to the colonisation process. Therefore, historical events are responsible for the livestock presently reared on the islands. Various degrees of crossbreedings have occurred, in some cases substituting the local populations. A variety of original local breeds still remains, in spite of recent breed introductions related to commercial exchanges and technical advances in animal reproduction. These local breeds give a fair contribution to animal production in the region, mainly in traditional or family-size breeding systems, in which their adaptation qualities are appreciated. In spite of their lack of specialisation, they also exhibit interesting production potential. Finally, they are also choice biological models for studies of interesting adaptation traits, such as the resistance to certain tropical diseases. Few programs have been initiated for the preservation or the management of local animal genetic resources in the Caribbean. Some are conducted in the Upper Antilles, where some creole stocks remain, as well as some well established, recently created synthetic breeds. In the Lesser Antilles, the French overseas departments promote in situ management actions, with concerted breeding programs. In spite of their reduced and scattered flock size, the Caribbean own a layer of local genetic resources, which are poorly documented and exploited. Recent works have raised the interest for these resources and for the development of sustainable breeding systems. A global strategy for the management of the local populations in the Caribbean and Latin America could enhance the efforts of the different partners.

AB There is a pressing need for: (i) cleaner fuels (free of aromatics and of minimal sulfur content) or ones that convert chemical energy directly to electricity, silently and without production of noxious oxides and particulates; (ii) chemical, petrochemical, and pharmaceutical processes that may be conducted in a one-step, solvent-free manner, and that use air as the preferred oxidant; and (iii) industrial processes that minimize consumption of energy, production of waste or the use of corrosive, explosive, volatile and nonbiodegradable materials. All these needs and other desiderata, such as the in situ production and containment of aggressive and hazardous reagents, and the avoidance of use of ecologically harmful elements, may be achieved by designing the appropriate heterogeneous inorganic catalyst, which, ideally should be cheap, readily preparable, and fully characterizable, preferably under in situ reaction conditions. A range of nanoporous and nanoparticle catalysts, designed, synthesized, characterized, and tested by the authors and their colleagues, that meet most of the stringent demands of sustainable development and responsible (clean) technology is described. Specific examples that are highlighted include: (a) the production of adipic acid (precursor of polyamides and urethanes) without the use of concentrated nitric acid or the production of greenhouse gases such as nitrous oxide; (b) the production of caprolactam (precursor of nylon) without the use of oleum. and hydroxylamine sulfate; and (c) the terminal oxyfunctionalization of linear alkanes in air. The topic of biocatalysis and sustainable development is also briefly discussed, and a cautionary note is sounded concerning fast screening methods for the discovery of new inorganic catalysts.

ID WASTE
AB The Northamptonshire Resource Efficiency Project (NREP) was a waste minimisation project club that ran in Northamptonshire, a county in the East Midlands region of the UK, between August 1997 and December 1999. Over the length of the Project, the 19 club members reported total savings of pound1.9 million and reported possible additional savings of pound1.24 million. NREP was a highly cost-effective way for businesses in Northamptonshire to achieve a reduction in waste at source and to introduce more sustainable methods of waste management. This paper examines the milestones set for sustainable development for UK industry; the value of waste minimisation clubs and the exit strategy employed to leave behind a network and structure to assist Northamptonshire businesses achieve more sustainable waste management practices. The exit strategy has allowed a larger number of businesses to be assisted than through the original Project. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

DT Article
DE ready-mixed concrete; waste management; washing out; alkaline waste
AB The UK government has recognised the vital contribution that the construction industry has to play in contributing towards sustainable development. While the issue of hardened concrete waste has received considerable attention, process waste arising from the manufacture of ready-mixed concrete is relatively unexplored. It is apparent that initiatives such as the landfill tax have encouraged UK ready-mixed concrete manufacturers to reduce substantially the amount of waste they produce. Environmental pressures continue to increase and ready-mixed concrete producers are being forced towards a closed loop production system. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

SO RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING

DT Article
DE household waste management; EU landfill directive; public perception;
   behaviour and participation; waste minimisation
AB Despite its lowly position on the waste hierarchy, landfill remains the predominant method of disposal in the UK. It currently accounts for disposal of 85% of municipal solid waste, despite the presence of national policies and targets to increase recycling and divert waste from landfill. However, the implementation of the EU Landfill Directive into the UK legislation in 2001 will place increasing pressure on the householder to participate in more sustainable waste management practices. This research will consider the different approaches available at a local level to meet one of the more pressing targets in the Directive - to reduce ultimately the disposal of biodegradable municipal waste (BMW) in the UK to 35% of 1995 levels. Significant changes in practice are required if the targets are to be met. This will require an increase in the availability of alternative options such as recycling and composting and place greater pressure on the householder to respond positively. At present there is little incentive for the householder in the UK to divert waste from disposal, as there is no penalty for non-participation in recycling schemes, and ease of disposal has generated apathy towards more time consuming alternative management options. International case studies have shown that direct charging is one approach that can produce dramatic results in terms of increased recycling and waste minimisation. Pay-as-you-throw (PAYT) schemes place responsibility on the householder to manage their waste in a more sustainable manner, with economics being the motivator. Reluctance to incorporate such an approach, and its applicability in the UK, form the focus of discussion and alternatives are considered with respect to changing behaviour, increasing participation and meeting the BMW waste targets.

TI Composting municipal waste in the UK: some lessons from Europe
SO RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING
LA English
DT Article
DE composting; kerbside collection; municipal solid waste; mechanical and
   biological treatment
AB Composting is an important element in sustainable waste management for the UK and could potentially have a vital role to play in meeting the obligations of the Landfill Directive. This paper evaluates the current state of the composting industry in the UK using the survey data from 1999 and compares its performance and profile with other countries in Europe. The UK industry profile shows that most waste (92%) is managed by relatively small, centralised sites which typically employ unsophisticated technology. These centralised sites also tend to compost green (garden) waste almost exclusively and this material is usually obtained from collection at civic amenity sites. In relation to the longer-term requirements of the Landfill Directive, it would appear that continued reliance on composting green waste would not be sufficient to meet the targets. Major structural changes will be needed if the industry is to meet the challenges ahead and kerbside collection and composting of both kitchen and green waste will probably have an important role to play. The results from the 1999 survey of composting also suggest that there is a renewed interest in using mechanical and biological treatment to process municipal solid waste directly. After several years of sustained growth, it is clear that the UK composting industry is at a crucial stage in its development. It is the opinion of the authors that the experience of the more advanced composting countries in Europe should be used as a model for the continued development of the UK industry in order to deliver sustainable waste management in the longer term.

AB In October 1996, the UK Government introduced the Landfill Tax, under the Finance Act as a fiscal measure to ensure that landfill waste disposal is priced so as to reflect its environmental cost and to help promote a more sustainable approach to waste management, through driving the waste hierarchy. The Landfill Tax Credit Scheme was introduced in order that a proportion of the money raised by the tax could be directed to Environmental Bodies to be used for certain types of environmental projects which complement the objectives of the Landfill Tax. Landfill Operators participating in this voluntary scheme have established various ways of managing applications from Environmental Bodies for Landfill Tax Credits. This paper sets out to give an overview of project development and the funding process within the Scheme, establish and discuss the various methods of Landfill Tax fund management, the types of Environmental Bodies that are participating in the Scheme and consider the influence of the Scheme's regulatory body ENTRUST.

AB A study was conducted in an agrosilvopastoral system, constituted by Eucalyptus urophylla and Panicum maximum ev. Tanzania-1, to verify the hypothesis that there were other factors, besides the low light availability, affecting the normal growth of the grass, four years after its introduction in the system. A NPK fertilization field trial was carry out, using the randomized block design, with the treatments in the 23 factorial outline, with two doses of nitrogen (0 and 100 kg/ha of N), phosphorus (0 and 70 kg/ha of P2O5) and potassium (0 and 100 kg/ha of K2O). The grass did not respond to P nor K fertilization, in spite of the low original P and K availability in the soil. However, with the application of nitrogen the rate of herbage accumulation was twice superior compared to control, showing that the grass growth was being restricted by the low N availability in the soil. The high response to the N fertilization showed that the shading was not the only factor limiting the understorey productivity and, also, that the established Panicum maximum plants were not being negative and significantly affected by allelopathic substances produced by eucalypts.

DE arable farming systems; long-term trials; sustainability; energy balance
AB Nine model arable farming systems, long-term stationary field trials (Norfolk crop rotation, spring barley continuous cropping, winter wheat continuous cropping, both in four variants of organic manuring), were analysed for their sustainability using the following parameters: total factor productivity trend of the TFP index, production stability and changes of selected soil properties - humus content and soil pH. A method for energy balance was used to calculate total factor productivity. Summarised data were analysed graphically, Among the examined long-term trials there was none that would have met all selected criteria of sustainability. Four systems failed in one of the studied parameters only as follows: Norfolk crop rotation - a decreasing trend of the TFP index was determined; spring barley continuous cropping, variant B (straw incorporation + green manure) - a considerable decrease in soil pH was assessed; winter wheat continuous cropping, variant C (green manure) and D (a check without organic manuring) - the systems show an unstable level of production. In variant D of spring barley continuous cropping, degradation of resource base (due to deficient nutrient balance and an inappropriate farming practice) affected productivity of the system in the delay of about 15 years. Development of productivity in all systems was affected by replacement of grown varieties.

DE research agenda for ethics in engineering; moral conflicts in

   responsibility
AB There are different possibilities for defining the areas for the application of ethics to engineering. They range from descriptive analysis of engineers' relationship to moral criteria and extend to normative issues on how engineers should design more "sustainable" technology. In this paper, a frame of reference is proposed, which makes it possible to elaborate in a transparent manner goals for analysis of the scope of ethics in engineering. Its point of departure is marked by two questions: 1) which types of situation in the practice of engineering require ethical reflection? and 2) to what extent are engineers expected to assume moral responsibility in the practice of their profession? The answers to both of these questions presuppose reflection on the societal processes of setting definitions and of making ascriptions. Understanding these Processes of societal "construction" of demands for ethical reflection in engineering and of engineers' moral responsibilities should be an important objective of the analysis of ethics in engineering.

AB The Maldives host a sophisticated and competitive international tourist industry which has replaced fishing as the dominant economic activity. With their rich tropical reef ecosystems and the abundant biodiversity of their marine environment, a total of 86 uninhabited islands had been converted into Resort Islands by the end of 2000. Resort Islands are equipped with comprehensive facilities for accommodation, food, recreation and leisure. They are also strictly reserved for foreign tourists and guarantee complete privacy. This gives the benefit of averting conflicts of acculturation with local islanders. In the arena of impacts on the physical environment, however, the consumptive leisure lifestyle of the tourists has been harmful to the Resort Islands as seen in sewage, garbage and waste pollution, as well as reef destruction and beach erosion. While the government of the Maldives takes great effort to harmonise tourism and the environment, the growth of mass tourism in the last 20 years has engendered grave environmental impacts. For future sustainable development of the Resort Islands, the tourists' environmental awareness must be increased to promote greater responsibility for the protection of the fragile coral and reef ecosystems of the Maldives.

AB This paper highlights the stereotypical images characteristic of Chinese social research on the Scandinavian model. How do Chinese commentators explain the development of the Scandinavian social policy model and how do they assess it? L it deemed morally sound and sustainable Reasons for the contracts of interpretation between Chinese and Scandinavian authors are categorized along two dimensions. There are "missing elements", typically the notions of social solidarity and social citizenship; which tend to be ignored by Chinese writers though underscored by Scandinavian writers. There are also "added elements", generated from Chinese contexts, which affect Chinese interpretations of the Scandinavian model. The study argues that since each welfare regime type is possessed of its own normative codes, supported by its own particular social order, it is necessary to decode such elements-especially cultural notions of welfare-to appreciate the points of view being expressed.

TI Conservation of biodiversity as a European directive: The challenge for
   France
SO SOCIOLOGIA RURALIS
LA English
DT Article
AB The purpose of the Habitats directive, based explicitly on scientific knowledge, is to preserve biological diversity on a European scale through the conservation of natural habitats and wild fauna and flora. It differs from the standard nature protection policy approaches because of the principles which it espouses: maintaining biodiversity and sustainable development. The use of these notions is clearly not neutral nor without consequences. In exploring the content of the biodiversity concept, this text seeks to demonstrate how it redefined nature. An analysis of the text of the directive reveals its theoretically innovative aspects and the difficulties of applying this new nature policy. While it is dear that there are real difficulties of interpretation which can apply to all the countries involved, the room to manoeuvre and the risks of conflicts vary from country to country because they depend on the particular political culture. Our hypothesis is that biodiversity, as conceived in the directive and the action framework proposed, involves many contradictions which account for the outbursts in political and scientific circles which its application caused in France.

AB In order to evaluate the impact of no-tillage (NT) against conventional-tillage (CT), or the effect of different fertilizers and herbicides, soils recently incorporated to agriculture from the El Salado basin river (Buenos Aires, Argentina) under a corn (1996/1998)-pasture (1998-)rotation were monitored for several soil (micro)biological, physical and chemical properties during the second (1997) to fourth (1999) years from the beginning of the experiment (1996). The rates of exchange of O-2 and CO2 expressed in terms of kg O-2 or CO2-C per hectare per day, are denoted as qO(2) and qCO(2). They decreased at the end of the corn growth cycle (T2) along with an increase of the respiratory quotient (RQ = qCO(2)/qO(2)), when compared to the time of land preparation (TO), irrespective of the management system. Both, qO(2) and qCo(2), increased 8 months after the mixed-grass-legume pasture planting (T3) keeping similar RQs with values slightly higher for NT than CT. At T4 (after 20 months of pasture), a 22 and 21% decrease of organic carbon was registered for NT and CT, respectively, with respect to the beginning of the experiment. A 22% (not significative) and a significative 31% diminish of total nitrogen was observed in the NT and CT systems, respectively. The results obtained are discussed in terms of soil function and sustainability in both management systems tested. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Productivity and sustainable use of Phragmites in the Fuyeni reedbed -
   Hluhluwe-Umfolozi Park - Management guidelines for harvest
SO SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY
LA English
DT Article
AB Phragmites australis (Cav.) Steud and Phragmites mauritianus (Kunth) reeds have been harvested from the Fuyeni reedbed in the Umfolosi section of the Hluhluwe-Umfolosi Park by neighbouring communities since 1972. A study to assess the impact of annual reed harvest on the density and size structure of the reedbed was done after concern was raised by reserve managers that harvest was possibly non-sustainable. Reed standing stock was estimated and the effect of three different harvest rates on reed density and size structure examined. The project aimed to make recommendations for the long term sustainable use of Phragmites from the Fuyeni reedbed. Results show that cut areas have higher total reed density than uncut areas and that cutting may be stimulating reed recruitment. The size structure of the reedbed is influenced by cutting through the removal of large reeds. Sixty-six percent of the total reed density in uncut areas consists of large reeds while no more than 15% of the total density in cut areas is made up of large reeds. Reed regeneration after cutting is rapid, but the proportion of large reeds remains low. No correlation was found between reed density and mean monthly rainfall. Harvest of no more than 30% of the number of large reeds in the population is recommended. A given area should be harvested no more frequently than biennially to allow young shoots to mature into large, usable reeds and to minimise impact on the reedbed and associated fauna.

DT Article
AB The aim of this paper is to discuss some of the current forces of change on the humankind land relationship and why an increasingly integrated approach to land administration and management is imperative. An overview of the past forces of change on land administration is discussed to demonstrate the dynamic nature of the humankind relationship. Particular attention is given to major global drivers such as sustainable development, globalization, economic reform and the information technology revolution. The potential impact of these current forces (particularly sustainable development), on the institutional, legal, political and technological frameworks of a nation, is discussed. New Zealand, which has undergone considerable economic and legislative reforms since the mid-1980s, is used as an illustration of trends and the imperative for a more integrated approach to land administration across those frameworks.

AB This paper presents the genesis of Evolutionary Systems Design (ESD) as a praxis that draws on General Evolution Theory and Social Systems Design methodology, in addition to Critical Systems Theory, to engage in lifelong learning and human development in partnership with Earth. The origins and foundation of ESD are portrayed as providing the basis for a framework that bridges evolutionary consciousness and evolutionary action. The roots of ESD are traced back to General Evolution Theory on the one hand and to the notions of evolutionary stewardship that grew out of the action - inquiry encounters fostered by the International Systems Institute on the other. It is described how these notions were given operational viability through the methodology of Social Systems Design. The fundamental tenets of ESD are presented and discussed by way of a four-stage evolutionary learning framework. Finally, the vehicle of Evolutionary Learning Community through which ESD operates is shown to embody the potential for individuals and groups to think, live, and act in harmony with the dynamics of which they are a part as a means to guide the conscious creation of sustainability.

AB Environmental charges are one of the economic instruments for controlling externalities. Their application to commercial flights has become a preferred method of encouraging the sustainable development of the air transport industry. Two kinds of externalities, aircraft noise and engine emissions, both generating profound impacts on human beings and on the environment, are considered here. The hedonic price method is applied to calculate the social cost of aircraft noise during the landing and take-off stages of the flight. The marginal impact of each flight with specific aircraft/engine combinations is derived for the allocation of aggregate noise social costs. In contrast, the dose-response method is applied to estimate the social cost of each engine exhaust pollutant during different flight modes. The combination of aircraft noise and engine emissions social costs is then evaluated on the basis of several environmental charge mechanism scenarios, using Amsterdam Airport Schiphol as a case study. It is shown that the current noise or engine emissions related charges at airports are lower than the actual social costs of their respective externalities. The implications of charge mechanism scenarios are subsequently discussed and evaluated in terms of their impacts on airline costs, airfares and passenger demand.

AB This paper investigates the relationship between participation, empowerment and sustainability. Using the multisectoral and multicontextual experience of participation amassed in South Africa, both pre- and post-apartheid, we address two questions: does participation lead to empowerment; and does empowerment, in turn, lead to sustainability? Further, what external factors mediate and influence that relationship? Analysis shows that a relationship does exist and is contingent on a number of contextual factors, crucial to its success. Findings are discussed in terms of the international literature on community participation and local democracy, and policy implications are identified.

AB Growth in urban places in Ireland from 1966 to 1991 has been greatly influenced by proximity to Dublin. In fact, the best predictor of growth has been such relative proximity. Government efforts to disperse growth to other areas of the Republic, however, have had some effects. Centres in the north-west and west of the country have grown more than would otherwise have been expected. While the growth in these areas may not be sustainable, the effects of previous government policies have been obvious.

AB A possibilistic approach to asses's the risk of co-occurring stressors in an aquatic ecosystem based on the use of fuzzy sets is illustrated at the hand of a hypothetical case study. There are two aspects of importance: a fuzzy stressor response relationship where the may have reference to a lower level end-point, and a rule-based inference model relating the occurrence of low-level stressors to a high-level ecological goal such as sustainability. The stressor-response is expressed as a conditional possibility. The possibility and necessity measures of the disjunctive composition of the stressor-response with the possibility distribution of the stressors yield an estimate of the ecological risk. Such a possibilistic approach may well serve as a screening procedure in multiple stressor resource management when only qualitative risk assessments are needed.

TI A generalised solution for step-drawdown tests including flow dimension
   and elasticity
SO WATER SA
LA English
DT Article
AB Step-drawdown and multi-rate tests present convenient tools for the estimation of the long-term yield of boreholes. However, the analytical methods commonly employed for the analysis of such tests are all based on the assumption that the drawdown in a borehole is a linear function of the discharge rate. Numerous constant rate tests, of which a few are discussed in this paper, has shown that this is not necessarily the case with boreholes drilled in the Karoo formations of South Africa. The drawdowns in these boreholes are not only influenced by the peculiar geometry of the aquifers, but also the non-linear deformation of the aquifers during the pumping of a borehole. The two new non-linear models for the analysis of step-drawdown and multi-rate tests introduced here, tries to account for these factors; in particular the deformation of the aquifer, flow dimension and dewatering of discrete fractures. Although the model proposed for multi-rate tests is still based on constant time steps, the one for step-drawdown tests allows the user to use arbitrary time steps, when performing the test in the field.
   Non-linearities in drawdown curves should always be treated with caution, especially when used to assign sustainable yields for boreholes. However, the example of a step-drawdown test performance at the Campus Test Site of the University of the Free State, shows that non-linearities can be addressed with an appropriate model.

AB Although many of the issues raised about forest plantations are non-trivial, there are a number of significant environmental advantages of plantation establishment that appear to outweigh concerns, if plantation management practices can be developed to address concerns regarding sustainability. Foremost among the advantages is that establishment of highly productive forest plantations can provide large quantities of wood and fiber from relatively small land areas, raising the possibility that pressures for harvesting within natural forests can be markedly reduced. Moreover, assuming that forest plantations are carefully established and managed, they have the potential to produce a continuous, renewable stream of industrial raw materials that results in less overall environmental impact than other types of raw materials. Assessment of total environmental impacts over product life cycles shows that structural and nonstructural wood and wood fiber products made from plantation-derived raw material yield markedly lower impacts than similar products made from metallic, cementitious, petroleum-based, or other raw materials. Similarly, examination of total environmental impacts of papermaking fiber production in forest plantations versus fiber production using annual agricultural crops shows significant advantages to wood fiber. Thus, forest plantations can yield environmental benefits that extend well beyond the geographic location in which they are located.

AB Strategic partnerships between civil society organizations (CSOs) and businesses are widely promoted as important new strategies to encourage corporate citizenship in the global South. This study tested these claims by examining 10 cases of collaboration between CSOs and businesses in Brazil, India, and South Africa. Findings suggest a sobering view of the benefits that civil society organizations and their constituencies can expect from collaboration. Development impacts may be more likely in sectors clearly linked to business interests, such as education and employment generation. Goals of organizational capacity building are more likely to be satisfied than those of citizen empowerment. CSOs and businesses reap mutual benefits from collaboration, but CSOs tend to shoulder more of the costs. Businesses can dominate collaborative decisionmaking with negative results for sustainability. The paper offers a number of propositions to guide further research and inform collaborative practice Empowered civil society collaboration with business is suggested as a more appropriate model than strategic partnership for CSOs pursuing sustainable development.

TI Entropy, transformations and sustainability of industrial life cycles
SO ZEITSCHRIFT FUR METALLKUNDE

DT Article
DE entropy; transformations; sustainability; industrial life cycles
AB Life cycles of materials are analysed in a systematic manner as a six-stage process. It starts with primary or secondary raw materials and ends with recycling or deposition of waste. The purpose of the industrial process is the transformation of matter into materials from which useful goods are produced. The complete cycle can be described as a sequence of man-made transformations with defined changes in entropy and energy. Entropy is the measure for any type of disorder. Changes in entropy are due to separation (mining, purification: negative entropy), ordering (consolidation, construction: negative entropy) or disordering (mixing, crushing: positive entropy).
   Sustainability comprises undesired, irreversible changes of our environment. It can be regarded as an inverse function of the raise in entropy. We have to distinguish entropy with respect to matter, energy and information. In our context, entropy changes due to different distributions of matter are of primary importance. Sustainability implies that increases in entropy due to industrial activities must be balanced, as much as possible, by extraterrestrial negative entropy. This requires the evaluation and comparison of entropy efficiency for the production of goods with defined useful properties.

AB The accumulation of humus in soils under Pinus caribaea Morelet forests may increase the availability of organically bound N, P. and S to plants and thus improve soil fertility. To test this hypothesis, we compared C, N, P. and S concentrations and forms in soil solid phase and soil solution under Pinus (PI) and natural savanna vegetation (Cerrado, CE). We sampled the 0-0.15, 0.15-0.3, 0.3-0.8, 0.8-1.2, and 1.2-2 m soil depth layers of Oxisols from three spatially separated plots under CE and PI; at each plot, soil solution at 0.15, 0.3, 0.8, 1.2, and 2 m soil depth and under PI additionally below the organic layer was collected during two rainy seasons (21 October-28 April 1997/1998 and 1998/1999).
   Under PI, the organic layer stored more C (24.5 t ha(-1)), N (2.6 t ha(-1)), P (140 kg ha(-1)), and S (261 kg ha(-1)) than under CE (1.2 t C ha(-1), 23 kg N ha(-1), 1.2 kg P ha(-1), 2.3 kg S ha(-1)). No significant difference in C, N, P, and S concentrations between CE and PI in the surface horizons of the mineral soil (C: 20.7-23.4 g kg(-1), N: 1.2-1.5 g kg(-1), P: 0.16-0.26 g kg(-1), S: 0.18-0.21 g kg-l) was observed. However, at 1.2-2 m soil depth C and organic N (N,,) concentrations were significantly higher under PI (C: 6.9 g kg(-1), N-org: 0.54 g kg(-1)) than under CE (C: 6.4 g kg(-1), N-org: 0.41 g kg(-1)). C/P and C/S ratios in soil solid phase decreased with increasing soil depth under CE and PI, those of C/N-org only under PI, leading to narrower C/N-org ratios under PI (12.9) than under CE (15.6) at 1.2-2 m soil depth. The result indicated enhanced N transport to the subsoil under PI.
   Total organic C concentrations (TOC) in the soil solution were similar under CE and Pi and throughout the mineral soil. Under PI, TOC concentrations decreased sharply between the litter leachate (30 mg C l(-1)) and 0.15 m soil depth (5 mg C l(-1)) indicating strong TOC sorption onto the surface mineral soil. Total N concentrations in the soil solution were 11-23 times higher under PI than under CE. Organic N concentrations also decreased between the litter leachate and 0.15 m soil depth under PI but No, concentrations increased from the litter leachate to 1.2 m soil depth and decreased between 1.2 and 2 soil depth, probably due to enhanced anion sorption at 2 m soil depth. No S and P was detectable in any solution sample. Higher C, N, and S storages and higher N availability under PI indicated that PI forests improve C, N, P, and S supply for plants in subsequent cultures and may therefore be considered sustainable with respect to organically bound nutrients.

AB The quantitative study of predictable temporal characteristics of disturbance phenomena is of tremendous consequence for both an effective understanding of biological process and for successful implementation of sustainable practices. This reliance is well demonstrated in both pure (e.g. biodiversity research) and applied (e.g. forestry sciences) research into patterns of fire-recurrence and its consequent interpretation and management implications. Much of fire-frequency prediction is dependent on the data manifest in a stand-origin-map. In this paper, we review the statistical methods for fire-frequency estimation from a stand-origin-map, where fire-recurrence is governed by an underlying probabilistic process that changes with time since last occurrence (i.e. non-constant hazard). We argue that both patterns of fire-recurrence that change with time are likely to be commonplace biological phenomena and that the conventionally prescribed methods for non-constant hazard fire-recurrence estimation from a stand-origin-map are erroneous. Even modified maximum-likelihood techniques that account for different degrees of data censoring are likely to be severely restrained in their capacity for rigorous estimation. We propose a novel formulation whereby the two-parameter Weibull distribution can be fitted retrospectively to the data in a stand-origin-map. This formulation is explored through an example from the Canadian Rockies. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A hierarchy of processes operating at different spatial and temporal scales form landscape pattern, and changes to the patterns can have impacts on habitats and forest dwelling species. Managing landscapes under the auspices of sustainable forest ecosystems and emulation of natural disturbance requires knowledge of the scale at which landscapes are patterned. To better understand the role of natural disturbance in two distinct ecoregions of the Ontario boreal forest, we used thematic landcover maps derived from satellite imagery to evaluate differences in the relevant scales and nested hierarchies of forest pattern between two regions: northwest Ontario (relatively undisturbed forest and little fire suppression) and northeast Ontario (long history of forest harvest and fire suppression). We define a relevant scale as the spatial level where non-random patterning of landscape structure occurs. Similar nested hierarchies occurred in forest and wildfire disturbance classes in northwest Ontario. In contrast, the relevant scales detected in the northeast occurred at fewer levels and in the disturbance class, which was the result of forest harvest, at only one level. The differences detected between the two regions indicate that current forest harvest practices that focus on landscape alteration at a single scale are creating new landscapes that are different from the natural landscape.

AB Host vaccination against tick infestation is at present the most practical and sustainable alternative tick control method to the current acaricide use which has serious limitations. However the success of this approach to control ticks depends upon the identification of target vaccine antigens. Members of the serine proteinase gene family may represent an interesting group of proteins to target as candidate antigens because of their involvement in regulation of many physiological functions and development processes in a wide range of organisms. We used RT-PCR with the 3' and 5' RACE to clone two cDNAs encoding full-length serine proteinases from the hard tick, Haemaphysalis longicornis. RT-PCR degenerate primers were designed from amino acid sequences surrounding active sites, His(57) and Ser(195) conserved among most known serine proteinase. Gene specific primers designed from nucleotide sequences of the RT-PCR products were used to prime the 3' and 5' RACE. Southern blotting analysis showed that both HLSG-1 and -2 are single copy. The 2 cDNAs, HLSG-1 and -2 are 1.2 and 1.0 kb long in size with open reading frames encoding polypeptides with 37.7 and 31.2 kDa predicted molecular mass respectively. Northern blotting analysis of total RNA from unfed and partially fed whole ticks showed that the expression of mRNAs for both HLSG-1 and -2 was induced by blood feeding. Expression analysis by RT-PCR showed that both HLSG-1 and -2 are expressed in other tick organs in addition to salivary glands and midguts. The 6 serine proteinase consensus cyteine residues are well conseverd in both HLSG-1 and -2. We have discussed our findings with respect to tick vaccine development research.

AB The error threshold for quasispecies in 1, 2, 3, and infinity dimensions is investigated by stochastic simulation and analytically. The results show a monotonic decrease in the maximal sustainable error probability with decreasing diffusion coefficient, independently of the spatial dimension. it is thereby established that physical interactions between sequences are necessary in order for spatial effects to enhance the stabilization of biological information. The analytically tractable behavior in an infinity -dimensional (simplex) space provides a good guide to the spatial dependence of the error threshold in lower dimensional Euclidean space.

AB In this research work attempts were made to study the bonding of thermoplastics with adhesives using solar radiation. In order to study the: curing behaviour experiments were conducted under varying conditions of temperature, exposure time and power. The cured samples were then studied under the optical microscope before subjecting them to tensile testing in order to study their mechanical properties. The fracture surfaces were further studied under the scanning electron microscopy in order to study the microstructural changes that are taking place during curing. In order to measure the performance of the solar radiation cured joints, features such as bond strength, surface morphology, microstructural changes, variation in properties of adhesives bonded joints are compared to those of specimens cured at ambient Conditions and specimen cured using microwave techniques. From the present study, it is evident that curing under higher solar radiation temperature generally improves the bond strength and quality of the adhesive joints when compared to other modes of the curing process-expect for the microwave curing process.

AB The simple sustainable or 'eternal' cell model, assuming preservation of all proteins, is designed as a building block, a primitive element upon which one can build more complete functional cell models of various types, representing various species. In the modelling we emphasize the electrophysiological aspects, in part because these are a well-developed component of cell models and because membrane potentials and their fluctuations have been generally omitted from metabolically oriented cell models in the past. Fluctuations in membrane potential deserve heightened consideration because probably all cells have negative intracellular potentials and most cells demonstrate electrical activity with vesicular extrusion, receptor occupancy, as well as with stimulated excitation resulting in regenerative depolarization. The emphasis is on the balances of mass, charge, and of chemical species while accounting for substrate uptake, metabolism and metabolite loss from the cell. By starting with a primitive representation we emphasize the conservation ideas. As more advanced models are generated they must adhere to the same basic principles as are required for the most primitive incomplete model.

AB The catalytic performance and characterization of ACuO(2-delta) (A = Sr0.63Ca0.27) and ACuO(2-delta)X(sigma) (X = F, Cl) catalysts have been investigated for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (ODE) to ethene. The results of X-ray diffraction indicated that the three catalysts are single-phase and tetragonal infinite-layer in structure. The incorporation of fluoride or chloride ions in the ACuO(2-delta) lattice can significantly enhance C2H6 conversion and C2H4 selectivity. At C2H6/O-2/N-2 molar ratio = 2/1/3.7 and space velocity = 6000 mi h(-1) g(-1), we observed 73.5% C2H6 conversion, 67.2% C2H4 selectivity, and 49.4% C2H4 yield at 660 degreesC over ACuO(1.901)F(0.088), and 87.4% C2H6 conversion, 74.4% C2H4 selectivity, and 65.0% C2H4 yield at 680 degreesC over ACuO(1.950)Cl(0.036) With the decrease in C2H6/O-2 molar ratio, C2H6 conversion increased, whereas C2H4 selectivity decreased. Within 48 h of on-stream ODE reaction, the two halide-doped materials exhibited sustainable catalytic performance. Based on the results of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, O-2 temperature-programmed desorption, and C2H6 and C2H6/O-2/N-2 (2/1/3.7 molar ratio) pulse studies, we conclude that (i) the incorporation of halide ions into the ACuO(2-delta) lattice could enhance lattice oxygen activity, and (ii) in excessive amount, the O- species accommodated in oxygen vacancies and desorbed below 600 degreesC tend to induce ethane complete oxidation, whereas the lattice oxygen species desorbed above 600 degreesC are active for ethane selective oxidation to ethene. By regulating the oxygen vacancy density and Cu3+ population in the halo-oxide catalyst, one can generate a durable catalyst with good performance for the ODE reaction. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB This study focuses on the sustainability of different technological options for the treatment of waste gases from a waste water treatment plant loaded with volatile organic compounds. The options considered an biofiltration, active carbon adsorption and catalytic and thermal oxidation. The amount of resources and utilities to construct and operate each system have been investigated from the point of view of the Second Law of thermodynamics. The unit in which all resources are treated is Joules of exergy. It was concluded that biofiltration was the most exergetically efficient system. The cumulative exergy consumption of the resources and utilities for construction and operation have been quantified in exergy terms. Further on, the requirements for the abatement of emissions generated by operating the waste gas treatment systems and the amount of renewables have been taken into account in the assessment of the sustainability of the waste gas treatment technologies. Finally, a comparison between exergy analysis and life cycle analysis in assessing the sustainability of the waste gas treatment options, is presented. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Improved nitrogen management is one of the main challenges of precision agriculture. We need to apply nitrogen rates customized to fit local crop needs. The response of corn (Zen mays L.) to two rates of nitrogen, representative of the range used in variable nitrogen application, was assessed over a growing season by means of micrometeorological and hyperspectral reflectance techniques. The experimental field, which was located near Ottawa, Ont., Canada, was ploughed in early May and fertilized in mid-May. Most of the field area (23.7 ha) received the recommended nitrogen rate of 155 kg N ha(-1). A sub-optimal rate of 99 kg N ha(-1) was applied on 3.7 ha and a low rate of 17 kg N ha(-1) was applied on 2.6 ha. The field was tile-drained and was not irrigated. The vertical flux densities of water vapour and CO2 were measured in the 99N and 155N areas throughout the growing season using two eddy-covariance measurement systems. Hyperspectral reflectance was measured in the three areas, and the temporal variability in the water band index (WBI) is reported. The 1998 growing season was characterized by precipitation that was above normal in June but with rainfall deficits in July and August. The eddy-covariance measurements showed that maximum evapotranspiration occurred earlier than maximum net CO2 uptake in the corn canopy. For leaf area index (LAI) greater than I, corn in the 155N area had a water use efficiency (WUE), defined as the ratio of daily net crop CO2 uptake to evapotranspiration, of 18.9 g CO2 kg(-1) H2O compared to 20.4 g CO2 kg(-1) H2O for the 99N area. Greater evapotranspiration, related to faster leaf expansion in the 155N area, was mainly responsible for the lower efficiency. Total biomass accumulation, calculated using eddy-covariance and soil chamber CO2, fluxes, was generally similar for the 99N and 155N application rates, with values of 2211 and 2183 g dry matter m(-2), respectively. As well, harvest yields were similar for the 155N and 99N areas wuth dry grain yields of 0.85 and 0.83 kg m(-2), respectively. Yield of the 17N area was 0.80 kg m(-2). Spatial yield variability decreased with higher N application rates. Corn in the 155N area was more affected by water deficit during the active growing period than corn in the 99N area. This was also supported by the WBI results. The recommended rate of nitrogen application did not induce an economically significant increase in grain yield, because of the rainfall deficit in July and August. This experiment shows that tools for assisting producers in making management decisions regarding nitrogen application rates need to include a weather component. Such tools will improve the sustainability of nitrogen management. (C) 2001 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

TI Solving nonlinear water management models using a combined genetic
   algorithm and linear programming approach
SO ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES
LA English
DT Article
DE water resources management; nonlinear models; genetic algorithm; linear
   programming
AB Gradient-based nonlinear programming (NLP) methods can solve problems with smooth nonlinear objectives and constraints. However, in large and highly nonlinear models, these algorithms can fail to find feasible solutions, or converge to local solutions which are not global. Evolutionary search procedures in general, and genetic algorithms (GAs) specifically, are less susceptible to the presence of local solutions. However, they often exhibit slow convergence, especially when there are many variables, and have problems finding feasible solutions in constrained problems with "narrow" feasible regions. In this paper, we describe strategies for solving large nonlinear water resources models management, which combine GAs with linear programming. The key idea is to identify a set of complicating variables in the model which, when fixed, render the problem linear in the remaining variables. The complicating variables are then varied by a GA. This GA&LP approach is applied to two nonlinear models: a reservoir operation model with nonlinear hydropower generation equations and nonlinear reservoir topologic equations, and a long-term dynamic river basin planning model with a large number of nonlinear relationships. For smaller instances of the reservoir model, the CONOPT2 nonlinear solver is more accurate and faster, but for larger instances, the GA&LP approach finds solutions with significantly better objective values. The multiperiod river basin model is much too large to be solved in its entirety. The complicating variables are chosen here so that, when they are fixed, each period's model is linear, and these models can be solved sequentially. This approach allows sufficient model detail to be retained so that long-term sustainability issues can be explored. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Organic and low-input cropping systems that use more C inputs are alternatives to conventional systems for sustaining long-term soil fertility. An understanding of the impacts of these cropping systems on N balance (N applied minus N removed in harvested plant material), storage and loss is necessary to improve long-term soil fertility and minimize the risk of environmental pollution. An evaluation of 4-year rotations of organic (N from legumes and composted manures), low-input (N from legumes and reduced amounts of synthetic fertilizers), and conventional (conv-4, N from synthetic fertilizers) and a conventional 2-year rotation (conv-2, N from synthetic fertilizers) on N balance, storage and loss was conducted from 1989 to 1998. Compared to the conv-2 system, the organic and conv-4 systems showed 119 and 8% greater cumulative N balances, respectively, over the duration of the study. However, N balance in the low-input system was 19% less than in conv-2 system. After 10 years of differential management, total N in the top 15 cm of soil was 1.46 g kg(-1) in the organic, 1.26 g kg-l in the low-input, 1.13 g kg(-1) in the conv-4, and 1.1 g kg(-1) in the conv-2 system. Compared to the conv-2 system, cumulative N losses for the organic, low-input and conv-4 systems were lower by 80, 92, and 10%, respectively. These findings suggest that organic and low-input cropping systems that add C to soil have the potential for storing N and making it available for future crop use, while minimizing the risk of environmental pollution.

AB High crop productivity in the North China Plain (NCP) relies on irrigation. However, as a result of rapid regional development in the last two decades the competition for water has become very acute. This presents a serious problem for the sustainable agriculture in the region. This work examines relationships between irrigation, evapotranspiration (ET), crop growth and water use efficiency (WUE) of a corn-wheat rotation common in the region. During the period of 1984-1996 field experiments were conducted at Luancheng Agricultural Ecosystem Station in the North China Plain to measure water and energy balance components and crop growth of corn and wheat. A process-based model (WAVES) was used to analyse the measurements and to simulate the effect of irrigation management on crop growth. The summer dominant rainfall of the region means that irrigation is required during the winter wheat growing season when the difference between rainfall and evapotranspiration is large, while corn grows during summer, some irrigation is still required. Soil evaporation (E,) is a significant proportion of total evapotranspiration especially when leaf area index (LAI) is low and on average E under a wheat canopy accounted for 30% of ET. Mulching reduced soil evaporation by up to 50% and saved about 80 mm of water during a wheat growth season. Current irrigation schemes in the area can be improved by reducing irrigation frequency and amount. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The Ricardian approach to estimating climate change impacts is an important technique for incorporating how adaptations modulate the overall effect. Past Ricardian work expresses climate sensitivities in terms of local effects only, ignoring the influence on adaptation of broader-scale social, environmental and economic factors. This paper extends the Ricardian approach to account for influences at multiple spatial scales. Results from multi-level modeling support the hypothesis that a county's Ricardian climate sensitivity is influenced not only by its climate but also by social factors associated with the climate of the agro-climatic zone in which it is located. The model estimates a non-linear, hill-shaped relationship between July maximum temperatures and agricultural land values, with initial increases beneficial in all counties but more beneficial in districts of high interannual temperature variability. Farmers and institutions in districts of high variability have therefore adapted to be more resilient to variability than farmers in areas of comparatively stable climate. However, the underlying reasons for this lessened vulnerability are unclear and may be associated with unsustainable land-use practices. Future research should investigate the precise form of these local and extra-local adaptations to determine if implementing the adaptations elsewhere would compromise agricultural system sustainability.

AB Single research methodologies do not suffice for a complete analysis of land-use change. Instead, a sequence of methodologies is needed that link up and integrate disciplinary components over a range of spatial and temporal scales. In this paper, a modelling methodology is presented aiming at the analysis of the spatial and temporal dynamics of land use at the regional level. The methodology explores the dynamic functioning of land-use systems, which is essential to bridge the gap between studies identifying problems associated with land-use change and studies aiming at understanding and manipulating land-use change processes. An illustration of the methodology is given for China where we have simulated a scenario of near-future (1991-2010) changes in land-use patterns. The methodology is adapted to include the nested simulation of different crop types in addition to the simulation of land-cover change. Results are presented for changes in the spatial distribution of cultivated land and special emphasis is given to shifts in the distribution of different crops. In the northern part of the country a decrease in the proportion wheat within the cropping system is expected whereas in the southern part the proportion of rice is decreasing. Corn and vegetable crops are expected to become more important within the cropping system in these parts of the country. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The monitoring of rural development and land use is a key requirement in order to produce information for policy-makers and planners and aid their understanding of development processes. Environmental and sustainability indicators, when combined with tools for their visualisation, manipulation and analysis are essential components of the monitoring process. By providing these information products and tools policy-makers can be given the opportunity to spatially interrogate the driving forces and the current state of rural development. However it is also vitally important for decision-makers to understand how trends will develop in the short-term future and the possible impacts of their decisions on the development process.
   This paper shows how the results of a spatially explicit land use model have been incorporated into a set of rural sustainability indicators to provide information to policy-makers in a form consistent with the information used in the monitoring process. The success of the monitoring process will depend not only on the availability of tools and indicators but also on the skills of the users and an institutional framework that fosters the application of these skills.
   Reliable and harmonised data are the key to obtaining useful results from the land use model chosen for this study, however responsibility for these data lies with the appropriate institutions in the countries of Central America. Demonstrating what can be done with 'their' data may provide these institutions with the necessary justification to overcome a lack of political will to invest in data collection, data use and the implementation of standards.

AB In Sikar district, 18 Major Land Resources Units (MLRUs), having homogeneity of biophysical resources such as landform, soil, vegetation, surface and ground water and present landuse, were identified, characterized and assessed for their potentialities and limitations. Information on each resource unit was further evaluated and assessed for sustainable landuse planning and development in the district. The land resources units, qualifying for land capability classes IIc and IIIe, having 3388 km(2) (43.38%) area, low intensity of degradation and reasonably good quality of water, are most suitable for both rain-fed farming with agroforestry system and irrigated farming with agrohorticulture system. The marginal lands with capability class IVc, suffering from various land degradation hazards, having 2086 km(2) (26.97%) area, and poor ground water potential, are suitable for agroforestry, pasture and silvi-pastoral systems. The remaining 2258 km(2) (29.20%) area, not suitable for cultivation due to soil depth, wind and water erosion, high salinity and waterlogging, could be developed for silvopasture using salt-tolerant plant species and for salt extraction.

SO ANZEIGER FUR SCHADLINGSKUNDE-JOURNAL OF PEST SCIENCE

ID TILLAGE; MANAGEMENT; PREDATORS; INSECT
AB The effects of ploughing and previous crop on winter wheat pests and their natural enemies under an integrated farming system was investigated in an experimental area in Slovakia. The experiment consisted of 4 small plots (50 m(2) each) to which both organic and inorganic fertilisers were applied. Moreover, there was one application of herbicide and a fungicide on each plot. The ploughing was either deep or ow, and either silage-maize or pea was used as a previous shallow crop. The effects of the ploughing and previous crop was studied by means of multivariate redundancy analysis (RDA) and subsequent Monte-Carlo permutation test. The results showed that there was a considerable temporal variation in the abundance of insect pests and their natural enemies. Of the two husbandry treatments, only ploughing caused significant difference in the composition and abundance of both pests and natural enemies. However, while most of the pests favoured deep ploughing, the majority of natural enemies occurred more abundantly on shallowly ploughed plots. The previous crop did not affect numbers of either pests or natural enemies. Two systems, integrated and organic, which have been surveyed previously, were mutually compared with respect to the abundance of insect pests. The organic farming system turned out to be more sustainable.

AB A subsistence hunt for elders by Inuvialuit of Holman, Northwest Territories, was observed over three spring harvest seasons from 1996 to 1998 to determine rates of crippling loss and to assess the sustainability of the harvest. King elders (Somateria spectabilis) are the dominant waterfowl species harvested. The number of king elders estimated to migrate past Holman in spring varied from 40 696 +/- 4461 (95% confidence interval) in 1996 to 70 018 +/- 14 356 in 1998, averaging 53 000 per year. Common elders (Somateria mollissima v-nigra) were much less abundant, varying from 2728 +/- 631 to 6017 +/- 770 birds, averaging 4400 annually. Peak numbers of king elders moved through the study area in 1-8 days during the second to third week of June in all years, and common elders peaked in 1-8 days during the first to second week of June. Strong winds may have hindered migration for a few days. Crippling loss rates during the hunt were low (3-9%) in the first two years of the study, but increased to 13-20% in the early open-water spring of 1998, when hunters were forced to shoot over open water rather than shorefast ice. On the basis of these estimates and harvest data from the Inuvialuit Harvest Study, we determined that Holman hunters removed 3.7-6.9% of the king elder subpopulation and less than 1% of the common eiders over the three-year study period. The present level of harvest of elders available to Holman hunters is likely sustainable. However, more information on natural mortality and recruitment rates, particularly for king elders, is needed to confirm this.

AB This paper analyzes the long-term prospects of profitably harvesting the forests in northwestern Russia in a sustainable manner, indicating the potential short- to medium-term competitiveness of the Russian forestry in both domestic and international markets. We have chosen a systemic approach (a modification of Porter' s Diamond) to investigate the threats to and possibilities of the Russian forestry. This means that we consider not only factor conditions, but also demand conditions, the presence and status of related and supporting industries, firm strategy, structure, and rivalry, and the role of government in creating a competitive Russian forestry. Our analysis of the factor conditions prevailing in the mid to late 1990s indicates that the prospects for the Russian forestry could be very good. However, this potential will be realized only if substantial problems can be solved with regard to revising government policy, clarifying property rights, developing and maintaining the infrastructure, and achieving a stable and not too rapid increase in costs. Furthermore, we think that domestic demand is a weak link and that a revitalization of this demand is necessary.

AB This study revealed the collective values of the flood victims in the Beijiang area, Guangdong, China, as a result of a hazardous flood in 1994. The victims were sceptical of large flood-prevention engineering structures. They believed that flooding was unavoidable, but by extending support networks, applying hazard-resistant designs, and developing loss-sharing adjustments the disastrous effects of a flood could be mitigated. Seemingly, victims were prepared to live with floods and adopted functional adjustments to lessen flood impact.

TI Deregulation and sustainable energy supply: Perspectives of nuclear
   power and renewable energies
SO ATW-INTERNATIONALE ZEITSCHRIFT FUR KERNENERGIE
LA German
DT Article
AB In the discussion about the strategies of a future energy supply structure for Germany, the concept of "sustainable development" has achieved a dominating position. Deregulation of the energy markets for energies transmitted through lines has moved new paradigms into the foreground. This should be reason enough for reassessing objectively all energy sources, including nuclear and renewables.
   This also makes it indispensable to define precisely the various different interpretations given to the sustainable development concept. Restricting it to problems of the environment and the climate is not correct. In the concept expressed by the Brundtland Commission and in the Rio Declaration, sustainability incorporates the need - contradictory at first sight - to make sparing use of the environment and promote economic and social development at the same time. Future generations must not be stripped of their possibilities to live and develop. In this comprehensive interpretation, some quantitative orientation for various energy options can be obtained by means of lifetime analyses. The parameters available for evaluation are resource, environmental and economic aspects.
   Introducing competition and deregulation in the power industry is legitimate not only for reasons of economic theory. Experience has shown that efficient growth and careful management of scarce resources are achieved not by government planning and regulation, but by the allocation efficiency of the markets. This makes competition a key factor of sustainable development.
   Against this background, perspectives of nuclear power and of renewable energy sources are evaluated.

TI The nuclear power challenge: The role of the new Framatome ANP
SO ATW-INTERNATIONALE ZEITSCHRIFT FUR KERNENERGIE
LA German
DT Article
AB The power industry, which is responsible for supplying more than six billion people on this globe, has undergone a fundamental change over the past few years. In the course of deregulation, competition was the main goal.
   Also the industries active in the nuclear field have been included in this change, operators and vendors alike. In addition to internal programs of enhancing competitiveness, also mergers on a national and on an international level play an important role in this process. This will enable industries to meet future challenges effectively, with foreseeable opportunities arising for nuclear power to be included as an economic and non-polluting way of generating electricity.
   Nuclear power will contribute a decisive share to the future electricity supply. It meets sustainability requirements in terms of continuity of supply, resource conservation and climate protection, and recent developments in the United States are revealing clearcut economic benefits.
   In response to trends on the market, the merger of the nuclear activities of Framatome and Siemens to Framatome ANP early this year has created a global company. It is active in all nuclear markets, such as construction projects, upgrading, nuclear fuels and service.
   Three regional companies in France, Germany, and USA offer services worldwide of the four corporate divisions, i.e. Projects and Engineering, Nuclear Service, Nuclear Fuel, and Mechanical Components.
   The German regional company, Framatome ANP GmbH, has its head office in Erlangen and, through its subsidiaries Advanced Nuclear Fuels GmbH (ANF), has expertise in fuel fabrication and, through intelligeNDT Systems and Services GmbH & Co. KG, in non-destructive testing in nuclear technology and HiTec industries.

AB Forestry practices and high rates of land clearance for agriculture are causing genetic erosion of valuable tree species in the Peruvian Amazon, thereby endangering the economic sustainability of rural communities and limiting Peru's opportunities for the development of new timber and non-timber forest products. The potential utility and limitations of six low-input interventions to help forestall further genetic erosion in the region are discussed, with a focus on local community involvement. Improved agroforestry systems may help reduce deforestation by increasing farm productivity, although methods to increase the currently low adoption rate of these technologies need to be developed. Use of strategic tree domestication techniques can also improve farm productivity and prevent inadvertent genetic drift and inbreeding associated with traditional domestication practices, although to have a major impact, current programs need to be extended across the region. Woodlot forestry could supplant selective extraction of timber and offers an attractive opportunity for poverty alleviation if appropriate credit and land tenure policies can be developed. However, it may also result in increased deforestation if activities on public land cannot be controlled. The implementation of improved seed collection systems and simple seed transfer guidelines would help to reduce the collection of seed of poor quality and low genetic diversity, and avoid maladapted plantings, although such programs are difficult to monitor and seed costs may increase. Strategic identification and design of in situ conservation areas would help to ensure the viability of conserved populations, but requires the forfeiture of significant revenue from timber concessions.

AB Madagascar's palm flora is very diverse (171 species) and has a high degree of endemism (97%). Palm products make an important contribution to the household economy of many rural families, especially in the palm-rich eastern escarpments. Many palms are, however, threatened by overexploitation and habitat destruction. We investigated which palm species were found and used in three villages on the eastern escarpments of Madagascar. The importance local people accorded to each species was compared to the number of its uses, number of people using it, and other aspects of its use. From this comparison it was concluded that even if important palms are used for more purposes than less important palms, they owe their importance to one or two of their main uses. We also investigated if there were any patterns in the distribution of informants' knowledge and whether such patterns could be related to socio-economic factors. There was a positive relationship between knowledge about palms and personal wealth and a negative relationship between distance to the forest and amount of knowledge. The latter can be a sign of an ongoing knowledge erosion. Sustainable use of native palms should be encouraged as it may contribute positively to village economy and knowledge preservation, and may provide incentives for preservation of remaining forest tracts.

ID ADOPTION; FARMERS
AB The Rwandan civil war escalated in 1994, killing 800 000 people and displacing another 2 million. Agriculture, the occupation of over 90% of the Rwandans was acutely affected as violence peaked in the middle of the growing season. This article analyses the effects of the war on bean varietal diversity as, pre-war, Rwandan farmers grew the greatest range of varieties in active use anywhere and maintaining such diversity was central to sustainable production. Extensive pre- and post-war assessments show the current bean varietal situation to be relatively promising. The war had lesser effects than anticipated: fighting was staggered, harvests were better than expected, and local seed channels generally continued functioning. However, changes in varietal profiles were noted over the longer term due to two trends: farmers' needs to intensify production and to respond to swift and widespread root rot pressures. The article ends with five methodological reflections on how to assess varietal erosion in sites of acute disruption.

AB Results are presented from 14 surveys in the Udzungwa Mountains, Tanzania. Forest fragments are ranked by occurrence of key species of primates, duikers and birds. Taken together, the West Kilombero Scarp forests, Mwanihana and Udzungwa Scarp have presumably viable populations of four Udzungwa endemics with the following total population estimates: Udzungwa colobus (Procolobus badius gordonorum 15,400), Sanje mangabey (Cercocebus galeritus sanjei 1350), Udzungwa forest partridge (Xenoperdix udzungwensis 3700) and rufous-winged sunbird (Nectarinia rufipennis 6850). The mountains are also strongholds for Swynnerton's robin (Swynnertonia swynnertoni), Iringa akalat (Sheppardia lowei), dapple-throat (Arcanator orostruthus), white-winged apalis (Apalis chariessa), Usambara weaver (Ploceus nicolli), and for Abbott's duiker (Cephalophus spadix). Appropriate village based conservation measures need to address questions about sustainable forest use, hunting and possibilities for forest regeneration in large tracts of fire-maintained grasslands.

AB South Asia is the most populated region of the world with several nutritional challenges. Though per capita food energy supply, child survival and life expectancy have improved, and even today large segments of the population are below the poverty line with high infant and maternal mortality rates.
   It is important to recognize the crucial role of nutrition throughout the life cycle-from conception to old age. It is very necessary now to move from food security to nutrition security and improve the quality of foods both in macro- and micronutrients in order to break the transgenerational effects of malnutrition. The key solutions to the problems should address the issue of social development, population stabilization, environmental degradation and inadequate health and nutritional services. Strategies for empowering women and actuating community participation as sustainable programmes for human development, measures to reduce underweight and stunting in children and prevention of micronutrient malnutrition across the population are required. Enhancing food and nutrition security through innovative diversified agriculture and dietary practices, prevention and control of infection, promotion of food safety and fortification of staples with appropriate attention on emerging chronic disorders are essential. Population control measures to stabilize the fertility rates, biotechnological approaches for genetically modified foods, nutrition surveillance based on assessment, analysis and action to address the logistic, technical and compliance issues with emphasis on promotion of breast feeding and complementary foods with adequate attention on the reproductive needs of adolescent girls, pregnant mothers ai A lactating women would eliminate low birth weight, stunting I and chronic energy deficiency in vulnerable groups. Focused studies on bioavailability of micronutrients and its enhancement, innovative horticulture interventions, fortifications, social marketing strategies would promote the intake of micronutrient and phytonutrient rich foods. In-depth epidemiological research I an insight into foetal origins of adult disease and nutrition-genes interaction and life style alterations will avert the emerging epidemic of chronic diet related disorders. An investment in preventing foetal malnutrition improves nutrition of women in reproductive age, infant and child nutrition and prevents the onset of chronic disease in adult life. Human resource development, IEC measures, technology transfer, operational and logistic research, building of databases, integrated, intersectoral, multidisciplinary plans and sound management information system and surveillance with net working and experience sharing in the region will help to overcome the common challenges and lay the foundation for a better scenario in these regions in the near future.

AB A workshop on National Plans of Action for Nutrition: Constraints, Key Elements for Success, and Future Plans was convened and organized by the WHO Regional Office for the Western Pacific in collaboration with the Institute for Medical Research Malaysia and co-sponsored with FAO and UNICEF from 25-29 October 1999 It was attended by representatives of 25 countries in the region and resource persons, representatives from WHO and other international agencies. The objectives of the workshop were to review the Progress of countries in developing, implementing and monitoring national plans of action for nutrition (NPANs) in the Western Pacific Region and to identify constraints and key elements of success in these efforts.
   Most of the countries have NPANs, either approved and implemented or awaiting official endorsement. The Plan formulation is usually multisectoral, involving several government ministries, non-governmental organizations, and international agencies. Often official adoption or endorsement of the Plan comes from the head of state and cabinet or the minister of health, one to six years from the start of its formulation. The NPAN has stimulated support for the development and implementation of nutrition projects and activities, with comparatively greater involvement of and more support from government ministries, UN agencies and non-governmental agencies compared to local communities, bilateral and private sectors and research and academic institutions.
   Monitoring and evaluation are important components of NPANs. They are, however, not given high priority and often not built into the plan. The role of an intersectoral coordinating body is considered crucial to a country's nutrition program. Most countries have an intersectoral structure or coordinating body to ensure the proper implementation, monitoring and evaluation of their NPANs.
   The Workshop identified the constraints and key elements of success in each of the four stages of the NPAN process: development, operationalization, implementation, and monitoring and evaluation. Constraints to the NPAN process relate to the political and socioeconomic environment, resource scarcity, control and management processes, and factors related to sustainability. The group's review of NPAN identified successful NPANs as those based on recent, adequate and good quality information on the nutritional situation of the country, and on the selection of strategies, priorities and interventions that are relevant to the country and backed up by adequate resources. Continued high level political commitment, a multisectoral approach, and adequate participation of local communities are other key elements for success.
   The participants agreed on future actions and support needed from various sources for the further development, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of their NPANs. The recommendations for future actions were categorized into actions pertaining to countries with working NPAN, actions for countries without working NPAN and actions relevant to all countries. There was also a set of suggested actions at the regional level, such as holding of regular regional NPAN evaluation meetings, inclusion of NPAN on the agenda of regional fora by the regional organizations, and strengthening of regional nutrition networks.

AB Experience in many parts of the developing world has shown that food fortification offers a cost-effective and sustainable solution to the problem of micronutrient malnutrition. Building on the advances in science and technology and backed by studies on the economic benefits of fortification programs, governments and industry are beginning to respond positively to the call of nutrition advocates to adopt fortification as H long-term strategy. On the other hand, formidable challenges still remain in many countries in Asia, constraining the widespread adoption of this strategy. The science and technology community needs to provide adequate scientific and technological information as basis for planning and decision making. The government faces the challenge of providing the enabling environment for all stakeholders to cooperate in the fortification effort. Industry faces the challenge of adapting its production system to the requirements of fortification in order that they can contribute to social objectives while pursuing their economic objectives. The international and bilateral add agencies need to seek tried and innovative ways to support the multiple players of food fortification, as these players in turn face the challenges that confront them.

AB The limitations of conventional approaches to eliminating micronutrient deficiencies drives the search for a sustainable paradigm. This manuscript argues that the public and private sectors must embark on modernization of the Asian food industry and reorientation of the international agricultural research complex so that nutritionally enriched essential foods will be affordable and accessible to the poor. It is recommended :hat this partnership take special care of the needs of Asian children. The costs of chronic undernutrition, availability of cost-effective strategies, and benefits of sustained nutrition improvement to individuals, families and nations are reviewed. The roles of food fortification, plant breeding and biotechnology, both actual and imminent, are described. The paper concludes that a recast Green Revolution directed to dietary quality may be the key to enhancing the learning and earning capacity of young Asians of the new millenium.

AB Today's problems often arise as unintended consequences of yesterday's solutions. Business and public policy settings suffer from policy resistance, the tendency for well-intentioned interventions to be defeated by the response of the system to the intervention itself. Just as an airline uses flight simulators to help pilots learn, system dynamics enables us to create management flight simulators to avoid policy resistance and design more effective policies. System dynamics is also a process for working with high-level teams designed to improve the chances for implemented results. This article discusses how system dynamics can be used effectively to design high-leverage policies for sustainable improvement and introduces the next three articles in this issue discussing the application of system dynamics to a variety of critical issues facing business leaders today.

AB The Canadian experience of modeling quality of life indicators is renewed with the environmental issue and the proposal of sustainable development. The theory of compact city establishes a direct link between quality of life, urban density, compacity and sustainability. Some models propose compact city as the ideal of urban form. Nevertheless, two problems remain present in this matter. Firstly, in Canada, the weak density in residential suburbs is presented as a problem for the environment, while consumers continue to prefer this kind of neighborhood. The behavior and the attitudes of Canadians should be understood and explained better in order to evaluate the differences between the urban sustainability model and residential satisfaction. Thus, the model must integrate a part of subjectivity. In general, the subjective indicators are presented as a methodological challenge. On the other hand, the relationship between urban pattern and sustainability seems still not clearly demonstrated. The purpose of this paper is to analyze to Canadian approach of compact city and the different models of quality of life and sustainability indicators. Using most essays realized in Canada, we compare different approaches in order to discuss the principal trends or contradictions and, finally, deal with the issues of Compact City.

AB Specific growth rates, exercise respirometry, and swimming performance were compared in young-of-the-year Adriatic sturgeon (Acipenser naccarii) maintained in freshwater (FW) or acclimated to brackish water (BW) that was slightly hypertonic to sturgeon plasma, at a salinity of 11 g.L-1. Specific growth rate was significantly (17%) lower in BW than in FW. Sturgeon in BW also had a significantly (30%) higher standard metabolic rate than those in FW. In both groups, the relationship between swimming speed and oxygen uptake was described equally well by a linear or exponential equation, with a power relationship between swimming speed and net cost of locomotion and a linear relationship between tailbeat frequency and swimming speed. However, sturgeon in BW exhibited higher mean total oxygen uptake, net costs, and tailbeat frequencies than the FW group at any given swimming speed. There were, however, no differences in aerobic scope or maximum sustainable swimming speed between the FW and BW groups because the BW group exhibited a compensatory increase in active metabolic rate and maximum tailbeat frequency. The results indicate that FW is a more suitable environment than mildly hypertonic BW for young-of-the-year Adriatic sturgeon.

AB The effects of a 24-h salinity challenge in water at 28 g.L-1 on plasma osmotic and ion homeostasis, swimming performance, and exercise respirometry were compared in young-of-the-year Adriatic sturgeon (Acipenser naccarii) maintained in freshwater (FW) or acclimated to brackish water (BW) that was slightly hypertonic to sturgeon plasma at a salinity of 11 g.L-1. Salinity challenge caused a significant increase in plasma osmolality and Na+ and Cl- concentrations in both groups, but this was significantly less severe in the group acclimated to the BW as compared with FW. Salinity challenge elicited a significant and profound decline in maximum sustainable swimming speed (U-crit) in sturgeon from FW, whereas there was no significant effect on U-crit in the sturgeon acclimated to BW. A negative linear relationship was revealed between plasma osmolality, Na+ or Cl- concentrations, and U-crit. These variables appeared to influence U-crit by increasing costs for locomotion while reducing the sturgeon's capacity for oxygen uptake and muscular work. The results indicate that prior acclimation to mildly hypertonic BW promoted osmoregulatory adaptations that improved the ability of the sturgeon to perform exercise following further increases in water salinity.

AB Sustainable forest management requires objective measures of forest condition and productivity. To help develop these measures, this stud, uses a multispectral remote sensing approach to explore the structural characteristics and physiological condition of vegetation following forest disturbance. The disturbance examined was three silvicultural practices (selection, shelter wood and clearcut) in an over-mature maple forest in the Algoma Highlands near Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario. Since the quality of remote sensing data is scale dependent, studies must be designed with some consideration of the spatial characteristics of the variable of interest. Variables investigated here included aboveground organization of vegetation (structure), and physiological condition of this vegetation following different silvicultural practices. Data were acquired at three altitudes (1000, 2000, and 3000 m), using a Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (casi). To uncover the scale and pattern of variation or each altitude, semivariogram analysis was applied Range and sill parameters were derived from semivariogram analysis of overall scene variance using the first principal component (PCA). Variance in physiological condition was analyzed from spectral red-edge inflection point wavelength (AP) data. The resulting variogram analysis indicated spatial resolutions of approximately 9.0 m and 5.0 m for the PCA and AP data, respectively. The sill and range parameters were also successfully correlated to critical forest parameters such as biomass, stocking and crown area. Obtaining a measure of the scale and pattern of variation was a precursor to the use of spectral information for analyzing the relationship of canopy reflectance to leaf-based measures (e.g., chlorophyll and other pigment concentrations) and biophysical features (e.g., crown cover and biomass). Relationships were examined using an ordination technique known as redundancy analysis (RDA). The RDA biplots uncovered a significant relationship between canopy opening and spectral indices. An improved understanding of resolution and condition related to forest disturbance was achieved.

AB This paper summarizes the work of the EFCE Working Party Education (WPE) over the last decade and attempts to identify effective educational solutions to meet the challenges caused by the rapid rate of change in technology and society world-wide. The paper uses the results of the 1994 WPE survey of curricula in European Chemical Engineering Universities to identify a first degree level core curriculum. The problem of how to adapt the discipline to meet technological and societal changes without losing its identity is addressed. Basic sciences, chemical engineering science, integrated systems design and holistic thinking are emphasized as essential elements of the discipline. The paper discusses how Safety, Health and Environment (SHE), biotechnology, computerized models, product design, sustainability and other new subjects have been incorporated into chemical engineering curricula since the original survey. A simple model of the education process is presented to indicate how students might obtain a chemical engineering understanding and mindset. The paper explains how chemical engineering evolved from its origins in the petrochemical, heavy chemical and nuclear industries, to its current wide range of applications in industries, such as fine chemicals, food, pharmaceuticals, software, and cybernetics. It is suggested that the impact of changes arising from industry, new technology and society has driven the chemical engineering discipline to a point where it is now ripe for re-invention. The effects of rapid industrial, technological and societal change on chemical engineering education are studied against the backdrop of a discipline on the threshold of a significant change. The paper concludes by identifying curriculum development, personal development and life-long learning as three important factors for educating chemical engineers for a successful future.

DE policy makers; re-use; revitalisation
AB Planners and politicians increasingly have to find solutions for development pressures that consume less land, generate fewer private car miles, use existing urban resources and conserve energy. One solution advocated by policy makers is to increase the number of homes within city centres as an integral tool of regeneration and sustainability policies (Department of the Environment, 1995. Our Future Homes: Opportunity, Choice and Responsibility - the Government's Housing Policies for England and Wales, White Paper, 27 June. HMSO, London; Department of the Environment, 1997. Planning Policy Guidance note 1: General Policy and Principles, February. HMSO, London; Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions, 1998. A New Deal for Transport: Better for Everyone. HMSO, London; Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions, 2000a. Planning Policy Guidance Note 3: Housing. HMSO, London; Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions, 2000b. Our Towns and Cities: the Future: Delivering the Urban Renaissance, White Paper, 16 November. HMSO, London.). Equally, dealing appropriately with the physical legacy of the recent past is a challenging problem. Changes to existing towns and cities, however, open up the opportunities for entrepreneurs to exploit obsolete buildings to meet the needs and aspirations of the present. Indeed, Jacobs (Jacobs, J., 1961. The Death and Life of Great American Cities: The Failure of Town Planning. Random House Inc., New York.) identifies that: "time makes the high building costs of one generation the bargains of a following generation....time makes certain structures obsolete for some enterprises, and they become available to others." This paper examines the background and process of the conversion of obsolete post-World War II office buildings to residential use. A comparative study of North America (Toronto) and Europe (London) will focus on the experiences of two cities where conversions have registered a significant impact in terms of new homes created and had a positive impact upon the respective city centre.

TI International trade in wood products: Its role in the land use change
   and forestry carbon cycle
SO CLIMATIC CHANGE
LA English
DT Article
ID SEQUESTRATION; DIOXIDE; SINKS
AB Accounting harvested wood products and their trade as an integral part of the carbon cycle of a managed forest is a challenging task. Nevertheless, an appropriate way is especially needed now that harvested wood products may be included in Article 3.4 of the Kyoto Protocol. The adoption of a method for accounting for these flows in the IPCC guidelines may have implications for the trade of wood products and thus on global forest management.
   Four methods of accounting for wood products in an international perspective are analyzed in the present study. The aim is to obtain insight in the technical and policy implications of the proposed methods. These methods include the present default IPCC method and three alternatives: flow consumption, flow production, and stock change. All four methodologies are applied to the 1990 data of Gabon, Sweden, and The Netherlands.
   The impact of accounting for wood products using alternative methods has - in some cases - a large impact on the carbon balance of the Land Use Change and Forestry (LUCF) sector. In the case of The Netherlands, it was found that the LUCF carbon balance could be `converted' from a sink into a source depending on the method chosen. However, the LUCF sector is very small compared to the total national carbon balance in The Netherlands. In Sweden, a country where the forest sector plays an important role, the alternative wood product methods influence the total national carbon balance by 34%. In Gabon, a country with conversion forestry, the impact of alternative wood product methods hardly influences the LUCF carbon balance because the emissions from deforestation are very large.
   The accounting method may have a large impact on the way countries regard their trade in wood products. It may be possible for countries to buy a sink through the wood products trade, by importing products faster than they decompose domestically. In the case of Gabon with its conversion forestry (the change from forest into other types of land use, like agriculture, it was found that under the flow consumption method, this country can partly export the carbon sources resulting from nonsustainable forest management. Nor is this latter method consistent with the energy chapter of the IPCC guidelines. The stock change method seems to be a suitable method, combining precise accounting and simplicity. This method is also an incentive for the use of wood in long-life products and bioenergy, and for sustainable forest management.

AB I compared the endemism of four plant groups (Araceae, Bromeliaceae, Palmae, Pteridophyta) along gradients of increasing anthropogenic forest disturbance, from undisturbed mature forest to disturbed forest (logged, grazed or burned), secondary forest, secondary scrub, ,and finally pasture, at 16 sites in the Bolivian Andes. I measured endemism as the mean inverse range size (number of 1 degrees cells) of all species per sturdy group encountered in each habitat and site. Overall, endemism was significantly higher in disturbed forest than in mature forest, but it declined in more strongly disturbed habitats To explain the relationship of range size to habitat disturbance, I propose that endemic species are somewhat competitively inferior to other co-occurring taxa, limited in their ability to establish and maintain new populations following dispersal and thus to expand their ranges. within their established ranges endemic species depend on natural habitat disturbances to prevent their competitive exclusion by other species, so they profit from a certain level of anthropogenic disturbance. This pattern and the explanatory hypotheses should be subjected to critical evaluation. Although the pattern does not apply to every endemic tropical plant species, it indicates that conservation of part of the endemic tropical forest flora may be achieved in forest areas subject to sustainable forest use without the need to completely exclude human activities.

AB Since agricultural activities were first recorded, there have been shortages of pollinators. Today it seems that pollination systems in many areas of agriculture are threatened by the inadequacy or lack of sustainable managed, indigenous, or imported pollinators. Pollinator shortages can adversely affect crop production and commodity markets. This paper presents an economic model than can be used. to measure some of the economic impacts of pollinator deficits on traded commodities. This economic analysis indicates that consumers of a commodity affected by a pollinator deficit may suffer because the commodity costs more and becomes less available. At the same time, although the producers of the affected commodity may experience crop declines, they may also experience economic gains in the form of higher prices. The amount the producer gains or loses depends on the shape of the supply and demand functions, and the magnitude of these losses or gains is an empirical question. Although there are few data available to evaluate this model, those we do have indicate that serious problems for world food supply, security, and trade could be in the offing if current declines in pollinator abundance, diversity, and availability are not reversed. Various crops and cropping systems are suggested as practical starting places for economic studies of the effects of pollinator declines, with emphasis on the type of data required.

SO CRITICAL STUDIES IN MEDIA COMMUNICATION
LA English
DT Article
AB A communicational reality is a culturally-specific conceptualization of social space constructed and shared by people through the act of communication. This article examines the role of technology in the construction of communicational realities, acknowledging that it is neither a neutral tool nor an autonomous agent in the process. The knowledge of how we use technology to engender communicational realities must contribute to the critical awareness of the individual in relation to the world. This knowledge must ultimately allow us to disassociate communication from those technologizings that lead, through the creation of virtual realities, to the separation of the knower from the known. Only by taking a critical look at the assumptions that our communication technologies lead us to make about the world, can we begin a process of reconceptualizing them away from their position as commodities to that of vehicles for self-knowledge and tools for the understanding and transformation of the world. This article introduces the concept of the sustainable communicational reality as a way to assess the values promoted by different conceptualizations and applications of communication technologies in our societies.

TI Tackling the down side: Social capital, women's empowerment and
   micro-finance in Cameroon
SO DEVELOPMENT AND CHANGE
LA English
DT Article
ID SMALL-ENTERPRISE-FOUNDATION; SOLIDARITY PAY; SOUTH-AFRICA; CREDIT;
   PROGRAMS
AB Micro-finance programmes are currently dominated by the 'financial self-sustainability paradigm' where women's participation in groups is promoted as a key means of increasing financial sustainability while at the same time assumed to automatically empower them. This article examines the experience of seven micro-finance programmes in Cameroon. The evidence indicates that micro-finance programmes which build social capital can indeed make a significant contribution to women's empowerment. However, serious questions need to be asked about what sorts of norms, networks and associations are to be promoted, in whose interests, and how they can best contribute to empowerment, particularly for the poorest women. Where the complexities of power relations and inequality are ignored, reliance on social capital as a mechanism for reducing programme costs may undermine programme aims not only of empowerment but also of financial sustainability and poverty targeting.

AB New democracies attempting to implement political and economic reform simultaneously are considered to face a dilemma, as democratization may undermine economic reform by encouraging political participation and empowering interest groups that are unlikely to benefit from reform. This article compares relations between interest groups and the government under one-party and multiparty rule in Zambia. Contrary to the assumptions of pluralist theory, the article argues that the influence of interest groups declined as a result of political and economic liberalization. Political liberalization in Zambia has so far resulted in a proliferation of civic associations and a weakening of corporatist links between the state and economic interest groups that had been granted some real influence in the previous authoritarian regime. This 'pluralist paradox' has meant, at least in the initial phases of multiparty rule, that interest group resistance has not constituted a significant threat to the sustainability of the reform programme, or to the electoral prospects of the Movement for Multiparty Democracy (MMD).

AB Sustainability is an inherently vague concept whose scientific definition and measurement still lack wide acceptance. Fuzzy logic is well suited to handle such a vague, uncertain, and polymorphous concept. In this paper, we develop a model called Sustainability Assessment by Fuzzy Evaluation (SAFE), which provides a mechanism for measuring development sustainability. Ecological (land, water, air, and biodiversity) and human (economical, social, educational, and political) inputs are treated individually and then combined with the aid of fuzzy logic to provide an overall measure. The output of the model is a degree (%) of sustainability of the system under examination (locality, state, country, etc.). The model is open to new inputs as reality and experience change, and it weighs all inputs' according to their impact. A number of selected economies are tested and respective degrees of sustainability are derived and analyzed. It should be stressed that this method in itself is both a new definition and numerical assessment of sustainability. The SAFE model may become a useful aid to policy and decision-makers as they strive towards increasingly sustainable policies. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Land cleared for agriculture in Western Australia has become severely degraded as deep-rooted native perennial vegetation has been replaced with annual cereal crops. Dryland salinity is the most severe form of land degradation in this region. The Western Oil Mallee Project has the potential to provide an ecologically sustainable solution to problems associated with land clearing, including dryland salinity. The project involves local farmers planting native eucalypt species which may be harvested to produce eucalyptus oil, electricity and activated carbon. Some potential benefits of an ecologically sustainable approach to industry development include reduced land degradation, increased biodiversity, increased local employment, diversified farm production and higher local community capacity.

ID CONTAMINANT MIGRATION; SOIL; LEACHATE; CLAY; BENTONITE; LINERS
AB A number of major problems associated with the containment approach to landfill management are highlighted. The fundamental Raw in the strategy is that dry entombment of waste inhibits its degradation, so prolonging the activity of the waste and delaying. possibly for several decades, its stabilisation to an inert state. This, coupled with uncertainties as to the long term durability of synthetic lining systems, increases the potential. for liner failure at some stage in the future whilst the waste is still active, leading to groundwater pollution by landfill leachate. Clay liners also pose problems as the smectite components of bentonite liners are subject to chemical interaction with landfill leachate, leading to a reduction in their swelling capacity and increase in hydraulic conductivity. Thus their ability to perform a containment role diminishes with time. More critically, if diffusion rather than advection is the dominant contaminant migration mechanism, then no liner will be completely impermeable to pollutants and the containment strategy becomes untenable.
   There are other less obvious problems with the containment strategy. One is the tendency to place total reliance on artificial lining systems and pay little attention to local geological/hydrogeological conditions during selection of landfill sites. Based on the attitude that any site can be engineered for landfilling and that complete protection of groundwater can be effected by lining systems, negative geological characteristics of sites are being ignored. Furthermore, excessive costs in construction and operation of containment landfills necessitate that they are large scale operations (superdumps). with associated transfer facilities and transport costs, all of which add to overall waste management costs. Taken together with unpredictable post closure maintenance and monitoring costs, possibly over several decades, the economics of the containment strategy becomes unsustainable. Such a high-cost, high-technology approach to landfill leachate management is generally beyond the financial and technological resources of the less wealthy nations. and places severe burdens on their economies. For instance, in third world countries with limited water resources, the need to preserve groundwater quality is paramount. so expensive containment strategies are adopted in the belief that they offer greatest protection to groundwater. A final indictment of the containment strategy is that in delaying degradation of waste, the present generations waste problems will be left for future generations to deal with.
   More cost-effective landfill management strategies take advantage of the natural hydrogeological characteristics and attenuation properties of the subsurface. The 'dilute and disperse' strategy employs the natural sorption and ion exchange properties of clay minerals, and it has been shown that in appropriate situations it is effective in attenuating landfill leachate and preventing pollution of water resources. Operated at sites with thick clay overburden sequences, using a permeable cap to maximise rainfall infiltration and a leachate collection system to control leachate migration. 'dilute and disperse' is a viable leachate management strategy. Hydraulic traps are relatively common hydrogeological situations where groundwater flow is towards the landfill, so effectively suppressing outwards advective flow of leachate. This approach is also best employed with a clay liner, taking advantage of the attenuation properties of clays to combat diffusive flow of contaminants. These strategies are likely to guarantee greater protection of groundwater in the long term. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

   SCHEMES; SPACE; MONEY
AB The author critically evaluates the impact and potential of a community currency-or local money system-known as the 'local exchange trading scheme' (LETS), to contribute to sustainable local development (SLD). Two distinct and contrasting models for sustainable development are described: a mainstream approach, focused on local regeneration [termed here the 'local economic development' (LED) approach]; and a radical 'green' or 'new economics' strategy (referred to as 'sustainable local development' or SLD). In the elaboration of these models the functions of community currencies within each perspective are outlined, and the basis for an evaluate framework is provided. Most previous analysis of LETS has used a broadly LED perspective; this paper focuses on an evaluation for SLD, as this has not previously been comprehensively done. For SLD, community currencies should enable people to: meet local needs through informal employment; revalue and redefine 'work'; promote localisation and self-reliance; shift consumption patterns towards sharing, recycling, reuse, and reducing resource use; and build green social networks. Findings from a case-study LETS indicate that this community currency is successful in allowing participants to make small changes in their lifestyles, consumption, and employment patterns towards SLD, but there are limitations of size, scope, funding and management to be overcome before this could be achieved more effectively with LETS. However, following the LED-relevant prescriptions for upscaling and mainstreaming would undermine the qualities which align LETS with SLD perspective, and this highlights the importance of choosing appropriate evaluative frameworks, particularly when appraising sustainable-development initiatives.

AB The safe minimum standard (SMS) approach is a collective choice process that prescribes protecting a minimum level of a renewable natural resource unless the social costs of doing so are somehow excessive or intolerably high. Arguments for the SMS are typically invoked in settings involving considerable uncertainty and potentially irreversible losses. However, the SMS is most commonly viewed as existing only on the periphery of thought in traditional environmental and resource economics. The specific objectives are: (1) to define the SMS approach generally and examine theoretical support, particularly for its application in endangered species decision settings; (2) to examine the relationship between an SMS approach and benefit-cost analysis (BCA); (3) to examine the relationship between an SMS approach and nonmarket valuation; (4) to compare an SMS approach to alternative definitions of sustainability; and (5) to review the general consistency of the SMS approach with the USA's Endangered Species Act (ESA) of 1973, as amended. Recent attention on this pragmatic policy approach has been something far greater than cursory, with advances and detailed discussions on theoretical considerations, philosophical underpinnings and case study applications. While the SMS emerges as a fairly coarse policy instrument, its pragmatic value is seen in complex environmental policy applications, such as endangered species protection.

AB Throughout much of the tropics, human-wildlife conflict impedes local support for national parks. By channelling tourism revenue to local residents, conservationists hope to offset wildlife costs and improve local attitudes toward conservation. To date tourism revenue-sharing (TRS) programmes have met mixed success. Local conditions and national policies that shape the success of TRS programmes were identified by comparing the experiences of both implementers and beneficiaries of pilot TRS programmes at three parks in western Uganda. Between 1995 and 1998, communities around these parks used a total of US $83 000 of tourism revenue to build 21 schools, four clinics, one bridge, and one road. In 1996, the Ugandan parliament passed legislation that changed both the amount of money available for TRS and the institutions responsible for sharing the money. The programme was suspended at all three parks while the implementing agency (Uganda Wildlife Authority) struggled to design a programme that complied with the new legislation. TRS funds collected before 1996 were shared through 1998, but since then no revenue has been shared. However, a revised TRS programme is expected to resume in 2001. In semi-structured interviews, both implementers and beneficiaries evaluated local TRS programmes and compared them to other benefit-sharing projects, particularly those promoting sustainable use of non-timber products within park boundaries (n = 44). Both groups of respondents listed revenue-sharing as the most important advantage of living next to a national park. Seventy-two per cent of respondents indicated that they thought TRS had improved attitudes towards the protected areas, and 53% thought TRS was more important then sustainable use of non-timber forest products. Although respondents were generally positive about TRS, in informal discussions respondents repeatedly mentioned four potential obstacles to TRS success, namely poorly defined TRS policies and unsteady implementing institutions, corruption, inadequate funds, and numerous stakeholders with differing priorities. From this survey and literature from experiences in other African countries, there are four key components of successful revenue-sharing programmes: long-term institutional support, appropriate identification of the target community and project type, transparency and accountability, and adequate funding. With firm institutional support and realistic expectations, TRS can play an important role in improving local attitudes towards conservation.

AB Indigenous systems of management for regulating extraction of non-timber forest products (NTFP) have not been well documented in arid zone grazing lands. Conservation projects have therefore lacked information on customary rights to trees, while they have enforced systems of tree resource management that often conflicted with the indigenous system. This study focused on the indigenous tree tenure system of the Turkana pastoralists called ekwar (plural ngik-warin). The indigenous tree management system in 15.4km(2) of the Turkwel River floodplain woodlands near Lodwar, Kenya was investigated. The study began in 1990 after impoundment of the Turkwel Gorge Dam. In 1990 and 1998, Turkana pastoralists were interviewed about the ekwar. In individual ngikwarin woody cover, wood volume and woody-plant density were measured, and wood extraction assessed in terms of stems and twigs removed by the pastoralists and the urban population of Lodwar. Intensity of charcoal burning was assessed in terms of the density of earthen kilns, and livestock impact in terms of browsing frequency on woody plants. Potential Acacia tortilis litter production was estimated and an ekwar quality index developed to describe woodland productivity conditions. Tree produce was shared with and leased to friends and relatives. Woody cover showed no significant changes, while woody-plant density and volume declined, over the 8-year period. The Turkana usually do not cut live trees, but use dead trees and dry tree-parts for making charcoal. Increased kiln density and increased extraction of tree-parts were considered to be indicative of increased pressure on the riverine woodlands. Livestock browsing did not seem to contribute to woodland degradation. However, decline in woody-plant density and volume might have contributed to the reduction of litter production of!: tortilis. Trends in woodlands in the floodplain might be associated with damming of the Turkwel River and local anthropogenic pressures. Also, the ekwar system of tree tenure seemed to be threatened by the official forestry policy that it be ignored. Incorporating the ekwar system into the forestry conservation policy may achieve sustainable use and improve conservation of the Turkwel River floodplain woodlands.

AB In tropical prawn (shrimp) trawl fisheries it is daunting to assess the sustainability of bycatch species because they are diverse and there is little historical and biological information for quantitative stock assessments. We developed a process to examine the likely impact of prawn trawling on the sustainability of bycatch species and applied this to fish bycatch in the Australian Northern Prawn Fishery. The 411 fish bycatch species were ranked with respect to biological and ecological criteria that contributed to two overriding characteristics, namely first, their susceptibility to capture and mortality due to prawn trawling, and second the population's capacity to recover after depletion. The rank of each species on these two characteristics determined its relative capacity to sustain trawling, and therefore its priority for research and management. Species that were the least likely to be sustainable came from the families Apogonidae, Ariidae, Bathysauridae, Callionymidae, Congridae, Diodontidae, Labridae, Opisthognathidae, Plotosidae, Synodontidae and Tetraodontidae. These species are highly susceptible to capture by trawls, they are benthic or demersal, their primary habitat is soft sediments, and their diet may include prawns. The recovery capacity of these species is also low, with the estimated removal rate by trawling high. The species that were the most likely to be sustainable came from the families Carangidae, Clupeidae, Ephippidae, Scombridae, Sphyraenidae and Terapontidae. They are less susceptible to capture by trawls, they are generally pelagic, their primary habitat is not in trawl grounds, and they have a broad depth distribution and range in the fishery. These species also have a greater capacity to recover, as most individuals have bred before capture, and a low estimated removal rate by trawling. The final ranking of the species must be used with caution because of the assumptions made in the process. However, the process is a valuable first step towards ensuring the sustainability of the bycatch species. Because of the simplicity of the process, it can be readily used in fisheries, particularly those with diverse bycatch, to manage the sustainability of their bycatch.

TI Strong versus weak sustainability: Economics, natural sciences, and
   "consilience"
SO ENVIRONMENTAL ETHICS
LA English

ID NEOCLASSICAL ENVIRONMENTAL ECONOMICS; ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS; PREFERENCES
AB The meaning of sustainability is the subject of intense debate among environmental tal and resource economists. Perhaps no other issue separates more clearly the traditional economic view from the views of most natural scientists. The debate currently focuses on the substitutability between the economy and the environ ment or between "natural capital" and "manufactured capital"-a debate captured in terms of M elk versus strong sustainability. In this article, we examine the various interpretations of these concepts. We conclude that natural science and economic perspectives on sustainability are inconsistent. The market-based Hartwick-Solow "weak sustainability' approach is Far removed from both the ecosystem-based "Holling sustainabilily' and the "strong sustainability" approach of Daly and others. Each of these sustainability criteria implies a specific valuation approach, and thus an ethical position, to support monetary indicators of sustainability such as a green or sustainable Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The conflict between "weak sustainability" and "strong sustainability" is more evident in the context of centralized than decentralized decision making. In particular, Firms selling "services" instead of material goods and regarding the latter as "capital" leads to decisions more or less consistent with either type or sustainability. Finally, we discuss the implications of global sustainability for such open systems as regions and countries. Open systems have not been dealt with systematically for any of the sustainability criteria.

ID HIGHLANDS
AB Land degradation is a great threat for the future and it requires great effort and resources to ameliorate. The major causes of land degradation in Ethiopia are the rapid population increase, severe soil loss, deforestation, low vegetative cover and unbalanced crop and livestock production. Inappropriate land-use systems and land-tenure policies enhance desertification and loss of agrobiodiversity. Utilization of dung and crop residues for fuel and other uses disturbs the sustainability of land resources. The supply of inputs such as fertilizer, farm machinery and credits are very low. The balance between crop, livestock, and forest production is disturbed, and the farmer is forced to put more land into crop production. For environmentally and socially sustainable development, there is an urgent need to promote awareness and understanding of the interdependence of natural, socioeconomic, and political systems at local and national levels. Understanding the current status and causes of land degradation is very important. This paper reveals the important elements of land degradation in Ethiopia and suggests possible solutions that may help to ameliorate the situation.

AB Four species of detritivorous (humus - former) earthworms were tested for their ability to velmicompost paper waste blended with cowdung in 6:1 (w/w) ratio. The anecic Lampito mauritii, Kinberg and the epigeic Eudrilus eugeniae. Kinberg were the most effective of the four species employed; 20 animals of each of these species generated castings amounting to about 52% of the feed mass (75 g) per fortnight. The performance of these two species was followed by the anecic Drawida willsi Michaelsen and the epigeic Perionyx excavatus, Perrier;they achieved approximately 46% vermiconversion in comparable settings. The vermireactors were sustainable as the animals have remained consistently healthy and reproductive over a period of six months, and are continuing to remain so, turning in a steadily rising vermicast output During this period E. eugeniae have grown to 2.3 times their original weight while the other three species have more than trebled their weights. The studies establish the feasibility of vermicomposting as a viable process for the gainful utilization of paper waste in an environmentally dean manner. They also indicate that all the four species of the worms screened by us are suitable for the process, with L. mauritii and E. eugeniae a shade more efficient than the other two species.

TI Seasonal differences in the soil water balance under perennial and

SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB Replacement of native deep-rooted grasses by shallow-rooted ones has resulted in greater losses of water and nitrogen by drainage. To counter this effect we have tested the hypothesis that liming, and the conversion of annual grass pastures to perennial grass pastures, could improve the sustainability of grazing systems in the high rainfall zone (> 600 mm per annum) in southeastern Australia, through better use of water and nitrogen. A field experiment consisting of sixteen 0.135ha (30m x 45m) grazed paddocks representing four pasture combinations (annual pasture (mainly Lolium rigidum) without lime (AP-); annual pasture with lime (AP+); perennial pasture (mainly Phalaris aquatica) without lime (PP-), and perennial pasture with lime (PP+)) was carried out from 1994 to 1997 on an acid Sodosol (Aquic Hapludalf) in southern New South Wales, Australia. Measurements were made of surface runoff, subsurface flow (on top of the B horizon) and soil water content. The results showed that perennial grass pastures, especially PP+, extracted approximately 40 mm more soil water each year than the annual grass pastures. As a result, surface runoff, subsurface flow and deep drainage were at least 40 mm less from the perennial pastures. These measurements were further supported by a simulation of soil water deficit and deep drainage for AP- and PP+ paddocks, using 10 years' past meteorological records. Overall, the results suggested that well-grown, phalaris-based pastures could reduce recharge to groundwater and make pastoral systems more sustainable in the high rainfall zone.

AB Following the discourse about sustainable development based on the Brundtland Commission's report and the processes in the UN Committee on Environment and Development, a sustainable urban development would require considerably more ambitious policies than today in order to limit energy consumption, reduce pollution and protect natural areas and arable land. Re-use of urban areas and more effective utilization of building sites is a possible strategy to this end. However, continuous growth in the building stock will make it increasingly difficult to bring urban development in wealthy countries within the frames of what is ecologically sustainable and equitable in a global perspective. Planning for a sustainable urban development must be oriented towards long-term goals and utilize knowledge about the environmental consequences of different solutions, but should not be based solely on means-ends rationality. Rather than aiming at consensus including all stakeholder groups, planning for sustainability should facilitate alliance-building among those population groups who can support the basic equity and environmental values of a sustainable development.

TI Planning and the National Assembly for Wales: Generating distinctiveness
   and inclusiveness in a new political context
SO EUROPEAN PLANNING STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
ID GOVERNANCE; GOVERNMENT
AB The creation of the National Assembly for Wales in May 1999 was part of a series of constitutional reforms in the UK initiated by the Labour Government after 1997. The Assembly, that has been awarded policy-making powers only, is still in its infancy, and any assessment of the perceived success of the new forum would be premature. Nevertheless, there are signs emerging that could give rise to the view that the Assembly will carve out a degree of distinctiveness in its approach to governance and substantive policy areas compared to that operating in England generally, and to the land use planning system in particular. This review paper charts the birth of the National Assembly for Wales, outlines its responsibilities and functions in relation to planning, and assesses what has happened 'on the ground' in its first 18 months. Overall, the paper portrays politicians and officials in the new governance framework searching for distinctiveness, inclusiveness and policy ownership; the task is to offer something different compared both to the system existing previously and to the on-going processes of institutional restructuring underway in other parts of the UK. It situates planning within the crucible of decentralization and devolution, since planning has been awarded a central facilitating role within the governance and restructuring process as part of the Welsh Cabinet's determination to deliver sustainable development in the twenty-first century.

AB Most evergreen oak forests growing in the Rat areas of the southwestern Iberian Peninsula have been gradually transformed into a unique kind of pastoral woodland, the Spanish dehesas and Portuguese montados, by means of an agroforestry use. The opening of dehesas by clearing and ploughing closed forest to obtain savannah-like landscapes with a density of some 40 trees per ha started in the early Middle Ages, although most current dehesas were created during the last half of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century. Dehesas cover at present an estimated 3.1 million ha and support a high biological diversity. In this paper we compare the current age structure of helm oak Quercus ilex L, dehesas and forests in order to ascertain whether the agroforestry use is hampering the natural regeneration of tree populations and hence the long-term sustainability of dehesas, We characterise the size structure of both mature trees and minor stems growing in forests and dehesas in two intensively studied plots, and then we develop indicators for population structure at wider spatial scale (10 dehesa and 10 forest replicates). Size structure could be reliably used as an indicator of age structure as neither site quality nor intraspecific competition could account for the variation in tree size observed neither within nor among the studied helm oak populations, The age structure of mature trees in forests closely fitted a negative exponential distribution, thus indicating a continuous input of individuals to the youngest age class (67.4% of mature trees on average for the 10 replicates), Contrary to this, in dehesa replicates the age distribution of mature trees was symmetrical and leptokurtic due to the disproportionate importance (78.0%) of central age classes (30-40 cm in diameter at breast height (DBH)). Apart from showing that the regeneration failure of dehesas is due to their agroforestry use, we suggest that this problem is inherent to their system of exploitation, i.e, it operates ever since each dehesa farm starts to be formed out from forests, although it has been exacerbated by the recent intensification of the agroforestry use of dehesas.

   belongs to the past - but what is left?
SO FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS

DE land rent theory; Martin Faustmann; theory of the highest revenue;
   optimal rotation; sustainability
AB The beginning of the land rent theory is closely related to the German forest economists Friedrich Wilhelm Leopold Pfeil and Johann Christian Hundeshagen (1828). It was further developed by Gottlob Konig (1864), Johann Heinrich v. Thunen, Max Robert Pressler, Gustav Heyer, Max Endres and in particular by Martin Faustmann (1849). His 1849 published and well known formula may be seen as the center of the land rent theory. However, the application of this concept demanded a considerable change of forest management practice due to the reduction of usual rotations and stocking density. Eventually, the land rent theory conflicted with the principle of sustained yield which had become the central idea of forestry in Germany in the 19th century. Since forestry under German conditions did not start as an investment on bare forest land, but had to manage existing forests under the principle of sustainability, the theory of the highest revenue seemed to be a more appropriate guideline for forestry. However, the maximization of the highest revenue assumed a marginal interest rate of 0% because the time span between input and output was not considered. Besides that, this principle also conflicted with the reality of forestry, because the scarcity of financial funds was not regarded. So far, both theories have not delivered solutions useful to real forest economic decision problems in Germany. Using an example from Lower Saxony, it is demonstrated that considering the objective of sustainability leads to results which are in accordance with the reality and the economic theory.

AB In 1995, a short-rotation plantation (2.5 hectares) was established in the mining region of Welzow-Sud in southern Brandenburg, Germany, on a clayey, sandy, lignite- and pyrite-free substrate in order to study the potentials of fast-growing tree species (e.g. balsam poplar). In this study, special emphasis was placed on yield aspects as well as on the interaction between soil and plant, especially with regard to plant and soil water relations. So far the results indicate that the cultivation of fast-growing tree species in short-rotation plantation is an adequate tool for establishing sustainable land use systems in post-mining landscapes. Above-ground biomass increments ranged from 7 to 20 tons of dry matter per hectare at age 4. Investigations on the leaf water potential of two poplar clones (low-yielding clone Androscoggin and high-yielding clone Beaupre) showed different stomatal behaviour. Whole-shoot hydraulic conductivity as well as conductivity of diameter classes and transpiration rate were significantly higher in the high-yielding clone. The tendency of drought stress-induced embolism was significantly lower in the fast-growing clone Beaupre. By modelling the soil water regime for the experimental plots, it was found that transpiration and water-use efficiency were higher in the clone Beaupre than in the clone Androscoggin. The deep percolation rate was also higher at the clone Beaupre site than at the experimental field grown with the clone Androscoggin.

TI Transportation fuels of the future?
SO FUEL PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE transportation; fuel; crude oil
AB Society is putting more emphasis on the mobile transportation sector to achieve future goals of sustainability and a cleaner environment. To achieve these goals, does society need to jump to a new combination of fuel and vehicle technology or can we just continue to improve on the current fuels and drive train technology that has powered us the past 70 or more years? Do we need to move to more exotic energy conversion technology (fuel cell vehicles?), or can improving fuel properties further allow us to continue using combustion engines to power our vehicles? What fuel properties can still be improved in gasoline and diesel? Besides removing sulfur, should there be less aromatics in fuels? Should aromatics be eliminated? Is there a role for oxygenates in gasoline and diesel? Do blending oxygenates in fuels help or hinder in achieving the environmental goals? Can we and should we reduce our dependency on crude oil for transportation energy? Why have not the previous government-sponsored Alternative Fuel programs displaced crude oil?
   The marketplace will determine which fuel and vehicle technology combination will eventually be used in the future. Does the information we know today give us insight to this future? This paper will attempt to address some of the key issues and questions on the role fuels may play in that marketplace decision. (C) 2001 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

TI Biomass and renewable fuels
SO FUEL PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE biomass; fuels from biomass; biological hydrogen production; sustainable
   energy systems; carbon constrained world
AB Biomass is an important contributor to the world economy. Agriculture and forest products industries provide food, feed, fiber, and a wide range of necessary products like shelter, packaging, clothing, and communications. However, biomass is also a source of a large variety of chemicals and materials, and of electricity and fuels. About 60% of the needed process energy in pulp: paper, and forest products is provided by biomass combustion. These processes could be improved to the point of energy self-sufficiency of these industries. Today's corn refinery industry produces a wide range of products including starch-based ethanol fuels for transportation. The biomass industry can produce additional ethanol by fermenting some by-product sugar streams. Lignocellulosic biomass is a potential source for ethanol that is not directly linked to food production. Also, through gasification biomass can lead to methanol, mixed alcohols, and Fischer-Tropsch liquids. The life science revolution we are witnessing has the potential to radically change the green plants and products we obtain from them. Green plants developed to produce desired products and energy could be possible in the future. Biological systems can already be tailored to produce fuels such as hydrogen. Policy drivers for increased use of biomass for energy and biobased products are reviewed for their potential contributions for a carbon constrained world. (C) 2001 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

AB This paper reviews the status of crop genetic resources in Yunnan province of China from 1978 to 1999. Results are presented of same research in the field of the diversity of cultivated and wild crop. Yunnan is one of the centre of origin or genetic diversity of more than 200 cultivated and wild crops. There are over 500 cultivated plants which account for over 80% of the total in China and more than 650 species of wild crops. In addition, there are more than 440 species of main wild flowers. According to our recently researches there are abundant species, subspecies and varieties of crop genetic resources in Yunnan Province. The Lancang River Valley is the richest genetic diversity centre of rice, maize, wheat, barley, buckwheat, legumes, ramie, sugarcane, vegetable, tea, actinidia and so on. For example, there are 59 varieties (including all varieties of Oryza sativa L. in China) in 5933 accession of Yunnan indigenous rice. The Lancang River Valley is one of the centre for genetic diversity of rice resources and a rich region for elite and rare rice resources of Yunnan, too. In order to protect the highly endangered crop genetic resources in the Lancang River Valley, it is necessary and very important to set up a collection, conservation, utilization and research system, enhancing their protection and utilization, in situ- and ex situ-conservation, farm management and sustainable production.

AB This paper analyses the scope of policies related to both shelter and employment for reducing urban poverty. It puts forward suggestions on how to strengthen such policies through local governance processes. Yet, the paper states that such local processes and associated shelter-employment policies are constrained by the broad economic context: although valuable local actions to combat poverty have indeed succeeded to some extent (e.g. support to small-scale, labour intensive, informal production), counteracting global trends have in many circumstances strengthened conditions such as capital-intensive production, unstable employment, unemployment and/or intra-urban differentials. The paper challenges the possibility of a comprehensive and sustainable development without significant changes in the current global context. It elaborates on the links between the shelter-employment policies at the local level and the overall economic trends, and makes recommendations for action. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB This paper examines the role of traditional religious beliefs and traditional leaders in conserving remnant patches of a unique type of dry forest in the Zambezi Valley of northern Zimbabwe. We examined aerial photographs spanning more than three decades, interviewed and surveyed local residents and mel with communities to learn about the environmental history of the forests and the factors that have affected land use in the area. Our results show that forest loss is dramatically less in forests that are now considered sacred or were in the past connected to sacred forests. This supports our hypothesis that traditional spiritual values have influenced human behavior affecting the forests, and have played a role in protecting them until now. We also found that rates of forest loss have been much higher in an area where traditional leaders are relatively disempowered within the post-independence political system compared to an area where traditional leaders have move power. These findings lead us to conclude that a strategy that links the conservation of culture and nature is likely to be more effective in conserving forests than a strategy that ignores traditional beliefs, values, and institutions,

AB Innovation continues to be an ever-more-critical issue as the global economy expands: it determines organizational sustainability. Do you want to be an innovator? Learn what it takes to succeed as an innovator. This paper addresses the issues from the innovator's perspective. Research on innovation has not provided a theory of innovation. The process of innovation continues to depend on the individual and the environment in which the innovator functions. This paper characterizes the scope and complexity of being the innovator; presents a set of concepts that can be applied in formulating, evaluating, and implementing innovation; considers the skills for dealing with technological uncertainty; and defines the issues that determine success or failure. There are no recipes for becoming the innovator, but there are basics that must be followed. This paper presents an overview of innovation; discusses types of innovation; provides insight to the innovation process; describes what it takes to be an innovator; considers the issues in overcoming resistance to innovation; and explains why innovators fail.

DE IMPATT diodes; microwave generation; silicon carbide (MC)
AB Silicon carbide (SiC) is an excellent material for high-power and high-frequency applications because of its high critical field, high electron saturation velocity, and high thermal conductivity, In this letter, we report the first experimental demonstration of microwave oscillation in 4H-SiC impact-ionization-avalanche-transit-time (IMPATT) diodes. The prototype devices are single-drift diodes with a high-low doping profile. DC characteristics exhibit hard, sustainable avalanche breakdown, as required for IMPATT operation. Microwave testing is performed in a reduced-height waveguide cavity, Oscillations are observed at 7.75 GHz at a power level of 1 mW.

TI Consequences of the shift from domiciliary distribution to site-based
   family manning services in Bangladesh
SO INTERNATIONAL FAMILY PLANNING PERSPECTIVES
LA English
DT Article
AB Context: Concerns about financial sustainability and the need to offer a broader range of reproductive health services to clients have led the Bangladesh family planning program to shift from conventional door-to-door (domiciliary) distribution to static (fixed) site-based service delivery However, it is of critical importance to carefully examine the consequences of the changeover on family planning performance.
   Methods: Using data from the longitudinal surveillance systems of the Operations Research Project of the international Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (ICDDR, B), a before-and-after analysis of the contraceptive prevalence, method mix, source mix, new acceptance rate and dropout rate was conducted to assess the consequences of the shift in service delivery approach.
   Results: The shift from domiciliary distribution to clinic-based service delivery appears to have resulted in a slight increase in contraceptive prevalence in the urban study area, from 54-56% before the shift to 55-57% afterward The changeover did not produce any discernable variation in the method mix, the proportion of new accepters of family planning or the contraceptive dropout rate. This apparent lack of change can be explained by increased use of alternative sources, with a substantial rise among users in reliance on pharmacies and shops (30-35% before vs. 42-50% after). In two rural study areas, the shift from domiciliary distribution to service delivery from static sites known as cluster spots resulted in an increase in the prevalence rate, from 52% to 57% in Palm and from 40% to 45-46% in Durgapur. The changeover coincided with greater use of injectable contraceptives and decreased reliance on traditional methods among rural contraceptive users. A notable immediate increase in new accepters also was evident as was a long-term decline in dropouts. in Paira, following the shift, 43-44% of current users obtained their contraceptive supplies from cluster spots, as did 32-33% in Durgapur.
   Conclusions: The recent change in the family planning program toward clinic-based delivery of an integrated package of essential health and family planning services appears likely to maintain, and perhaps even increase, contraceptive prevalence levels in Bangladesh.

DT Article
DE elastic similarity; cylindrical contact; stress
AB The contact problem between cylindrical conformal surfaces, modelling for instance a fastener joint, is studied. A closed form solution is obtained in Part I of the paper for the case of elastic similarity, improving
   (i) the solution obtained by Persson (On the Stress Distribution of Cylindrical Elastic Bodies in Contact, Ph.D. dissertation, 1964), which was also limited to identical materials, and
   (ii) the results of Noble and Hussain (Int. J. Engng. Sci. 7 (1969) 1149), which were limited to the case of perfect fit of contacting materials.
   The variation of the contact area, pressure distribution and maximum sustainable load is given for the complete range of possible dimensionless loading parameter E(1)(*)DeltaR/Q and first Dundurs' material parameter, alpha.
   Under conditions of initial clearance, the contact area are, E, increases with load from zero to a limiting value, epsilon (lim), which depends only on the material parameter alpha. Vice versa, under conditions of initial interference, the contact is complete until there is detachment and the contact area starts to decrease with load up to the same limiting value, epsilon (lim), which is also the only possible value of contact area for neat-fit conditions, under-any applied load.
   Finally, a complete assessment of the strength of the contact is given for the entire range of working conditions. As expected, the strength of the joint decreases rapidly if the extent of the contact area reduces, and finally tends to the limit predicted by the Hertzian theory when the are of contact is smaller than about 30 degrees. The optimal conditions for avoiding yielding are reached for a contact are smaller than the limiting are epsilon (lim): this means that it is not possible to reach the optimum from a configuration of initial interference.

AB A method is presented to interrelate the development of economy, environment and social quality in communities. Economy and environment, in initial development stages, oppose each other. Social welfare and economy generally develop simultaneously. To assess overall progress in sustainable development, an integrated and quantifiable framework is presented which defines five levels of sustainability. Increasing sustainability is characterized by growing responsibility for the impacts of man's actions in space and time. Through increased eco-efficiency and changed awareness, nations and companies arrive at a synergistic relationship between environment and economy. It is indicated that social security benefits expenditure increases by a factor 3.5 and carbon dioxide emissions per capita decreases by a factor 3 at each higher level of sustainability. Quantified differences in sustainability levels of 24 nations are shown. Priorities for improving and safeguarding sustainability are indicated.

DE regionalisation; industrial production; regional concepts; barriers;
   measures
AB Regional business concepts are said to have huge potential to support sustainable development in industrialised countries (e.g. Stransfeld, 1999). However, whereas efforts have been made to implement regional concepts within agriculture and forestry, empirical findings show that regional concepts are only of minor importance to managers within industrial production (Rentz et al., 2000). Considering this situation, the aim of the present article is to explain why regional business concepts have rarely been implemented in the field of industrial production. Therefore, in the course of the present article, a raster for the identification of relevant barriers on a personal, enterprise, inter-firm and macro-economic level will be developed and applied. Subsequently, suggestions for a set of measures to overcome these barriers to regionalisation will be given. The results have been identified in the framework of a questionnaire to about 30 decision makers of industrial companies within research, a project promoted by the German Ministry of Education and Research.

As an alternative to the 'understanding the database by computer' approach, we focus on the meaning of the database by using the so-called 'understanding the database by human' approach. The discernability matrix in rough set is used to obtain a qualitative description of the database. Special domain knowledge is embedded in the discernability matrix, and an attribute reduction set is employed to develop a sustainable development indicator.

TI Environmental education, community mobilization and sustainable
   development in Hong Kong: a comparative perspective
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND WORLD ECOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE environmental education; community mobilization; Hong Kong; sustainable
   development
AB This paper focuses on efforts to promote environmental education and community mobilization around environmental issues in Hong Kong. It is primarily concerned with efforts directed at the broader community (i.e. the population as a whole) rather than with environmental education through formal school and college curricula. The paper draws on a recently completed study commissioned by the Environmental Campaign Committee, the principal source of financial support for such efforts undertaken by environmental NGOs, community groups and educational institutions in Hong Kong. The study examined how and to what effect the Committee had used its financial resources between 1994-1999. It also examined international experience with a view to recommending changes in the overall approach to environmental education and community mobilization initiatives and their funding in Hong Kong.
   The paper suggests that the existing approach to community-wide environmental education and its funding in Hong Kong have suffered from various weaknesses, most notably the absence of an integrated and goal-oriented strategy, an over-reliance on a 'top-town' campaign-based approach, a failure to establish explicit linkages with the concept of sustainable development and to ground initiatives at the local neighbourhood and community levels, and a preoccupation with the financial inputs provided to support this work at the expense of effective monitoring and auditing of project outputs and benefits.

DE San Ignacio Lagoon; Mexico; salt production; sustainable development
ID BAJA-CALIFORNIA-SUR; MEXICO
AB This work is devoted to analyzing the pros and cons of the proposed San Ignacio Lagoon (SIL) salt production project in Baja California Sur, Mexico. The analysis of the project was done taking into account the technical data of the main potential effects of the SIL project, and by comparing the SIL proposed actions with the data of Ojo de Liebre Lagoon, where an almost identical salt production project has been operating for more than 44 years. The analysis was done from the following perspectives: biodiversity, biosphere reserve management, and socioeconomic development. The resulting analysis of the pros and cons of the SIL salt production project addresses key aspects of sustainable development in Third World nations. The resulting analysis indicates that the SIL salt production project is compatible with the biodiversity conservation of the zone. The SIL salt production project seems to be one of the best options to attain the sustainable use of natural resources of the most arid and isolated zone of all Mexico.

TI Development of socio-economic impact assessment methodology applicable
   to large water resource projects in India
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND WORLD ECOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE impact assessment; India; sustainable development; social justice
ID RESETTLEMENT; POLICY
AB The genesis of socio-economic impact assessment (SIA) in India is pressure from funding agencies like the World Bank, Asian Development Bank, and similar institutions. Of late, these institutions have stressed appraisal of environmental concerns as a precondition for financial support to large infra-structure projects. However, SIA studies are easier to conceptualise than to implement, because the issues involved are nebulous, complex, highly nuanced, difficult to define, and not easily amenable to quantification. These are some of the reasons for the cursory treatment of socio-economic impact studies in India as a formality to satisfy monitoring and funding agency requirements and not as a tool for ensuring maximum social good through the developmental process. However, proper implementation of the concept of SIA in essential in attaining the goals of sustainable development. Ensuring social justice, i.e. preventing the continued impoverishment, displacement, social dislocation, and marginalisation of the weaker sections of Indian society, who always seem to bear the burden of adverse effects of such large infra-structure projects in disproportionate numbers, is also a goal of SIA. Increasing ambivalent attitudes and mounting opposition towards the implementation of large water resources projects of late in India necessitate systematic, transparent, and exhaustive consideration of all relevant socio-economic issues before implementation of such projects. The objective of this study was to develop a comprehensive methodology for SIA for large water resource projects in India. The methodology was based on the review of the literature and other means and implicitly addresses the major goals of SIA sustainable development and the achievement of social justice related to development.

ID AQUIFERS
AB Effective management of groundwater in and countries, such as Saudi Arabia, is an important factor in sustainable development. A regional numerical simulation model of a multi-aquifer system including the Dammam and Umm Er Radhuma (UER) aquifers was developed to assess the behaviour of the aquifer system under long-term water stresses. The model was utilized to predict the responses of the aquifer system under three alternative pumping schemes over a planning horizon of 31 years (1995-2025). Model results postulate that dewatering of the Dammam aquifer will occur at low productivity sites and along the outcrop with the current trend towards increasing abstraction. The UER will exhibit significant cones of depression at large irrigation projects. Aquifer dewatering and drawdowns will be minimal with the conservation alternative. This management scheme should be adopted for the future development ami protection of groundwater in the province.

ID FRAMEWORK
AB The main objective of this article is to shed light on an important issue of water conservation-groundwater rights and legislation. Principles of groundwater rights are detailed and their applications to major aquifer systems, groundwater basins and wadis are discussed. Legislation and the clarification of water rights are vital for the sustainable development of groundwater. They are urgently needed in Saudi Arabia in particular and in all areas where demand exceed supply. Legislation is one of the main pillars upon which any conservation policy is built. In this article a model is suggested for groundwater allocation in aquifers shared by more than one state.

SO INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL SCIENCE JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB The article addresses the need, posed by the challenges of sustainable development and the changing context at the beginning of the twenty-first century, for changes in the method and practice of science. The major challenges for a 'sustainability science' arise from increasing complexity at the ontological, epistemological, and political levels, calling for an integrated science going far beyond an inter-disciplinary style of research. The requirement is for the development. adoption, and dissemination of a truly complex-systems scientific research model. Complex socio-ecological systems share a number of fundamental properties that require changes in scientific methods, criteria of truth and quality. and conceptual frameworks. These properties include non-linearity, plurality of perspectives, emergence of properties, self-organisation, multiplicity of scales, and irreducible uncertainty. Some implications of the analysis are pointed out, in the form of practical recommendations. The authors argue for the involvement of both natural and social scientists in the investigation of the necessary steps to develop a sustainability science.

AB This document is a published version of the keynote speech made at the Asian Regional Workshop on Sustainable Development of Irrigation and Drainage for Rice Paddy Fields held in Tokyo in July 2000, hosted by the Japanese National Committee of the ICID.
   This report outlines the current state of paddy agriculture in Japan, focusing on the history of paddy field development, current status of paddy field improvements, the formation of rules on water use, and the roles of land improvement districts, which form the basis of managing agricultural water in Japan. It also highlights the present situation of agriculture in Japan, directions of relevant efforts and initiatives, and the importance of enhancing multiple functions of paddy agriculture for the national livelihood as well as securing a stable food supply.
   Paddy agriculture is an effective way of achieving both agricultural production and environment conservation functions in the Asian monsoon region. However, in the face of limited land and water resources as well as rapidly increasing population, a stable food supply will be difficult to attain in the future without the development and the establishment of irrigation and drainage technologies for paddy fields, and the dissemination and sharing of these technologies.

AB The computer based model presented in this paper regards strategies for water supply companies to deal with nitrate pollution of groundwater aquifers. In Germany, as well as in many other European regions, nitrate pollution is one the most important problems for water protection and water supply. The simulation of an existing water supply company shows a high level of conformance between simulation results and economic data of the company. The simulation of scenarios with high nitrate pollution shows important between the strategies of using deeper aquifers, of technical treatment of raw water, and of co-operation with the agriculture regarding costs and environmental sustainability. Also these results reflect fairly well the situation in Germany.

TI New left, new age, new paradigm? Roy Bhaskar's from East to West
SO JOURNAL FOR THE THEORY OF SOCIAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Roy Bhaskar's From East to West attempts a new synthesis of religion and science. It does so by elaborating "transcendental dialectical critical realism" (TDCR), which Bhaskar claims to be developmentally consistent with his earlier system, (dialectical) critical realism ((D)CR). This paper initiates an immanent critique of TDCR and suggests directions for explanatory critique. It suggests that TDCR is not developmentally consistent with DCR in respect of it's theory of mind, its emphasis on intuition, and its embracement of ideological aspects of New Age and karma. However, the overall synthesis, in which a religious outlook overreaches and embraces an emancipatory scientific outlook, addresses the alethic truth of our situation: an ecologically sustainable future involves moving on to a new outlook and a new life in which we both see ourselves and act as part of the cosmic whole, and the "bad infinite" of desire is overcome.

   SELECTION; REGIONS; BARLEY
AB Biological resources used by local people for a long period of time preserve historical records and scientific competence attained while they develop, conserve, maintain and utilize the landrace varieties of those crops sustainably, ensuring their descent to successive generations. Ethiopian farmers and the traditional farming systems they still exercise have a tremendous positive impact on maintaining wheat genetic diversity with the associated indigenous knowledge. Twenty-one durum wheat landraces, 11 of which were collected from North Shewa and the remaining 10 from Bale were examined for five qualitative morphological characters. The long beak character was monomorphic at lower altitude (< 2100 m a.s.l.). The phenotypic frequencies for characters showed that the long and intermediate beak types were found in both sites, with the long one being the predominant type in most of the strategic sites (localities). The short beak type was rare in most of the strategic sites (localities) in Bale whereas in North Shewa its frequency reached a maximum of 51%. Black glume was in rare frequency in most of the strategic sites (localities) and districts (depending on size, a district contains several localities). The three seed colour groups (white, brown and purple) were found in a similar proportion across districts, and in situ conservation zones (farmer-based on-farm crop conservation zones, and depending on size a zone contains several districts) with considerable differences among strategic sites (localities). While white glume colour was predominant at lower altitude (< 2300 m a.s.l.), brown glume was most frequent at higher altitude (> 2301 m a.s.l.). The frequency of the purple seed colour increases with increasing altitude. Intra-population polymorphism was common for most traits. The overall estimate of diversity in in situ crop conservation sites is very high (H' = 0.81 +/- 0.01). The first three canonical functions accounted for 85.5% (48.5, 19.7 and 17.4% respectively) of the variation between varieties. The hierarchical cluster analysis revealed two major clusters and eight subclusters. In most cases, the cluster analysis based on the qualitative traits did not necessarily cluster varieties on the basis of their collection sites. The two major clusters contained varieties from Bale and North Shewa in situ crop conservation zones.

AB 1. To test common assumptions that the reduction in agrochemicals on organic farms allows (i) the conservation of biodiversity but (ii) has some cost in terms of increased pest damage, we compared arthropod communities and pest damage levels to fresh market tomato Lycopersicon esculentum on 18 commercial farms. These farms represented a range of management practices, with half of them operating as certified organic production systems and half as conventional operations.
   2. Purported drawbacks to the adoption of organic farming include an increased incidence of pest damage and higher risk of pest outbreaks. Although insect pest damage levels varied across the spectrum of farm management practices, they were not associated with whether the farming operation was organic or conventional; organic and conventional farms did not differ significantly for any type of damage to tomato foliage or fruit.
   3. Although conventional and organic farms shared a similar range of arthropod damage levels to tomato, we detected a significant difference between the actual community structures of arthropods associated with the crop. Using canonical discriminant analysis, we found that whereas herbivore abundance did not differ, higher natural enemy abundance and greater species richness of all functional groups of arthropods (herbivores, predators, parasitoids and other) distinguished organic from conventional tomato. Thus, any particular pest species would have been associated with a greater variety of herbivore species (diluted) and subject, on average, to a wider variety and greater abundance of potential parasitoids and predators, if it occurred in organically grown tomato.
   4. Trophically based community parameters, specifically species richness and relative abundance of functional guilds, were clearly associated with farm management category (organic vs. conventional). However, the abundance patterns of prominent pests and natural enemies were associated with specific on-farm practices or landscape features. Fallow management, surrounding habitat and transplant date of the crop field were strongly associated with arthropod species that explained the major variability among farms. Insecticide intensity was a weaker factor. Other factors, such as distance to riparian habitats and tissue nitrogen levels, did not emerge as indicators of pest or natural enemy abundance.
   5. This comparative study of active commercial farms does not support predictions of increased crop loss in California tomato when synthetic insecticides are withdrawn. It highlights the importance of large-scale on-farm comparisons for testing hypotheses about the sustainability of agro-ecosystem management schemes and their effects on crop productivity and associated biodiversity.

AB The variability in rainfall in semi-arid Niger is great both spatially and temporally and is considered to be one of the most limiting factors in agriculture. To investigate these constraints more quantitatively, climate data at both survey and detailed scale were analysed. The results show that rainfall can vary considerably even within a few kilometres distance and on different time scales which means that crop yields are very unpredictable. Socio-economic surveys at two villages showed that smallholders have adapted a range of management strategies to ensure at least a minimum yield. Despite this, soil fertility is declining and further technologies need to be integrated into farming systems to make them sustainable. (C) 2001 Academic Press.

SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS

DT Article
AB The constitutions of many nations have been explicitly or implicitly founded upon principles of the social contract derived from Thomas Hobbes. The Hobbesian egoism at the base of the contract fairly accurately represents the structure of market enterprise. A contractarian analysis may, then, allow for justified or rationally acceptable universal standards to which businesses should conform. This paper proposes general rational restrictions upon multi-national enterprises, and includes a critique of unjustified restrictions recently proposed by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). I propose restrictions that may be tighter than the OECD and international law currently demand, because reason requires that the activities of enterprises accord with standards of environmental and governmental sustainability in addition to consortium, national law and international law agreements. I argue that it is justifiable that indictments may be presented by a citizen or a government against the local arm of a multinational enterprise in response to violations committed by an arm within a different country.

ID TRIAL; SHOCK
AB Despite major advances in inotropic medications and our understanding of their proper use, surgical management of heart failure is the fastest-g owing aspect of cardiovascular surgery. In addition to causing 750,000 deaths annually, myocardial infarctions leave an estimated 60,000 more patients in severe congestive heart failure and several times more individuals with compromised ventricular function. As these patients are offered reparative surgical options, surgeons, anesthesiologists, and cardiologists face physiologic challenges that can be optimally overcome only by modifying treatment strategies to address patients who have failed appropriate medical therapy, including milrinone, vasopressin, and nitric oxide. As our comfort with mechanical support increases, the threshold for embarking on these lines of treatment will be altered. Innovative devices have been created to meet this clinical need, but they must provide adequate quality of life to create sustainable value and health for society.
