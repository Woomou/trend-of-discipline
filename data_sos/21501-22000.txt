AB The Philippine government borrowed heavily from the Asian Development Bank and the Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund to finance its Contract Reforestation Program between 1988 and 1992. People were paid to plant trees on public lands in the first 3 years of the program. A 25-year stewardship agreement succeeds the paid labour arrangement which provides cost benefit sharing between the contractor and the government. Results of the first phase of implementation were poor. On the same site where problematic reforestation projects were assessed in the study are successful small tree farmholdings without government support. The study aimed to determine the success conditions for spontaneous and sustainable tree growing at the farm level. Six cases of farm-based tree growing in northern and central Luzon were investigated. Twenty-six respondents were interviewed using informal and semi-structured questionnaires. de Groot's actor-in-context analysis provided the main inquiry technique (de Groot, W.T., 1992. Environmental Science Theory: Concepts and Methods in a One-World Problem Oriented Paradigm. Elsevier, Amsterdam). The success conditions identified were (1) practice of intercropping, (2) the farmers' direct need for tree products and other uses, (3) assured access or property rights, (4) wood products market prospects, (5) the farmers' economic situation, (6) the farmers' enterprising attitude, (7) building on local options and (8) collective or neighbourhood co-operation. As part of the government intervention for maximum program impact the following steps are recommended: (1) provision of more planting areas with tenurial security; (2) granting of usufruct permits on arable open public lands; (3) making tree growing or conservation measures a condition for progressive attainment of stronger land tenure status; (4) creation of a wood market and other institutional infrastructures; (5) allow any enterprising farmers to encroach on new areas for farm forestry; (6) food security before reforestation concerns; (7) building on what is natural; and (8) flexible and contextualized reforestation plans. Upland farms are potential management units for reforestation. As a management modality farm-based tree growing is appropriate for squatted public lands or areas under stewardship agreement and it is strategic in penetrating the inaccessible and remote sites with a high certainty of success.

ID PEPTIC-ULCER DISEASE
AB Best medical practice for a specific disease state results from sustainable quality improvement. This process requires ongoing systematic measurement of the local current process of care with integration of therapeutic algorithms aimed at reducing clinical variability and cost while sustaining quality and patient satisfaction. The dynamic application of these principles is disease management. This article reviews the transition from total quality management in industry to disease management in health care, and describes disease management efforts in peptic ulcer disease.

DT Article
AB One important criterion for success on the slow path to sustainable development is the integration of policy generally, but especially the incorporation of sustainability principles into all areas of policy. This is an objective of Article 130r of the European Union's Maastricht Treaty, and the new Blair government in the UK has recently claimed that environmental matters will guide all areas of policy in the future. One problem, of course, lies in translating the principle of integration into concrete changes on the ground. Another is securing agreement as to what are sustainability principles, followed by acceptance of evaluation and implementation procedures that guarantee that such principles get a fair hearing, That in turn requires openness of the process of auditing policy, as well as opportunities for reconstructing valuation procedures such as risk management, cost benefit analysis, precautionary action and eco-auditing in ways that bring to bear on safeguarding planetary survival processes and ensuring environmental and social justice in the allocation of gains and losses. Critics argue that the UN is a notoriously bureaucratic and disaggregated organisation. Below, Lowell Flanders documents what the UN is actually trying to do to create a sustainability audit in the heart of the policy procedure via its Commission on Sustainable Development (CSD). Compared to ten years ago, there is certainly progress. But because of continuing arguments over just what sustainable development actually is, the opportunities for creating a smokescreen over policy integration remain all too tempting.

SO HEALTH EDUCATION RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB Health and environmental education seek to address the living conditions and lifestyle choices that lead to health and environmental problems by motivating and teaching students how to participate in the reconstruction of themselves and society in accordance with ecological values and the democratic values of social and economic justice, While an ethic of care unites health and environmental education in this endeavour, liberal and conservative educational practices in the area of values education are dominated by discourses of values relativity and neutrality. This paper seeks to provide a case for teachers adopting a committed stance in teaching young people an ethic of care so that they may participate in the personal and social changes needed to advance the transition towards a healthy and sustainable world, In particular, it draws upon insights from the literature of environmental values education, which is characterized by intense debates between those of liberal and committed persuasions, to explore the ethical and pedagogical issues involved in teaching for an ethic of care in both health and environmental education.

DT Article
AB This paper gives an account of some of the major developments in the field of low-cost educational water quality monitoring in South Africa as an approach to environmental education, The wide acceptance of this approach to education in schools as well as non-formal settings may be an indication of the many complex problems in a country plagued by problems regarding the availability of reliable supplies of clean, fresh water and sanitation, It reflects critically on some of the serious problems that have developed as a result of the non-availability of sufficient supplies of fresh, clean water to many disadvantaged communities, The non-availability of fresh running water and water-borne sanitation are causing serious health problems in many disadvantaged communities, The origin of many of these problems can be traced back to inadequate and inequitable legislation of the past, The problems facing the post-apartheid Government structures now are vast and challenging, Education, especially initiatives like the Schools Water Action Programme, is increasingly being looked upon to help develop wider understanding for the need for the sustainable and responsible utilization of our fresh-water resources, as well as the basic needs and rights of all people.

SO HEALTH POLICY AND PLANNING
LA English
DT Article
ID HEALTH; SERVICES; SYSTEM; MARKET
AB This first of two papers on the health sector in Lebanon describes how unregulated development of private care quickly led to a crisis situation. Following the civil war the health care sector in Lebanon is characterized by (i) ambulatory care provided by private practitioners working as individual entrepreneurs, and, to a small extent, by NGO health centres; and (ii) by a fast increase in hi-tech private hospitals. The latter is fuelled by unregulated purchase of hospital care by the Ministry of Health and public insurance schemes. Health expenditure and financing patterns are described. The position of the public sector in this context is analyzed. In Lebanon unregulated private care has resulted in major inefficiencies, distortion of the health care system, the creation of a culture that is oriented to secondary care and technology, and a non-sustainable cost explosion. Between 1991 and 1995 this led to a financing and organizational crisis that is the background for growing pressure for reform.

DE adult learning; community development; health promotion
AB The Kadavu Rural Health Project in Fiji focused on improving the community capacity for health development in each of the nine districts and in the Province of Kadavu. The essential activity was to provide information on village health issues to people who were endorsed to make decisions within existing local government and traditional structures. The Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion was adapted by commencing with 'community learning' based on an adult education cycle of experience review, information seeking, policy development and community action planning. Village, district and provincial councils were able to formulate public policies, mobilise community action and create healthier village environments. A 'bottom-up' development approach, from village to district and provincial councils, clarified roles and responsibilities, identified resources and developed processes that, as extensions of normal community practices, are likely to be sustainable. Kadavu provides a health promotion model that is generated and legitimated by local communities, rather than by government ministries or external agencies.

AB Enhancement methods have been applied for more than a century throughout the natural range of the Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.). Hatcheries, the cornerstone of enhancement programmes, are used to: facilitate colonization of new habitats; restore or rehabilitate stocks to once productive habitats; supplement wild stock production; compensate for major environmental disturbances or problems such as hydroelectric development and acid rain; support fisheries entirely dependent upon hatchery stocking; and foster research and technology development. The benefits from enhancement progammes include: contributing to fisheries and wild stock conservation; increased awareness of the resource and natural environment; technology support for the aquaculture industry; and increased knowledge of salmon biology. The risks from enhancement include: reduced genetic diversity and population fitness; adverse ecological effects; and further degradation and loss of wild stocks. Enhancement-is one of a series of management measures that requires careful planning and should be fully integrated within management programmes for the stocks, the resource and its ecosystem. This paper reviews the application of enhancement technology in management programmes for Atlantic salmon in North America and Europe with emphasis on the former. Emphasis is placed on the use of hatcheries because of their prominence as an enhancement tool. (C) 1997 international Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

AB A 3-year (1989-92) experiment conducted at Rudrur with 6 rice (Oryza saliva L.)-based crop sequences, viz rice with safflower (Carthamus tinctorius L.), indian mustard [Brassica juncea (L.) Czernj. & Cosson], bengal gram (Cicer arietinum L.), maize (Zea mays L.), wheat (Triticum aestivum L. emend. Fiori & Paol.) and sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) showed that rice-sunflower gives significantly higher rice equivalent yield (8.48 tonnes/ha), higher production efficiency (36.4 kg/ha/day), higher net return Rs 26 160/ha) and benefit : cost ratio (3.18). This was followed by rice-bengal gram with rice-equivalent yield 7.97 tonnes/ha, net return Rs 23 865/ha and benefit : cost ratio 2.98. The land-use efficiency of rice with bengal gram, indian mustard, wheat or sunflower was 61-64% in the year, whereas that of rice with safflower or maize was 65-71%. The value of sustainable yield index revealed that rice-sunflower system was more stable (89%), followed by rice-bengal gram (82.8%).

AB The amount of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in indoor air, usually called TVOC (total volatile organic compounds), has been measured using different definitions and techniques which yield different results. This report recommends a definition of TVOC referring to a specified range of VOCs and it proposes a method for the measurement of this TVOC entity. Within the specified range, the measured concentrations of identified VOCs (including 64 target compounds) are summed up, concentrations of non-identified compounds in toluene equivalents are added and, together with the identified VOCs, they give the TVOC value.
   The report reviews the TVOC concept with respect to its usefulness for exposure assessment and control and for the prediction of health or comfort effects. Although the report concludes that at present it is not possible to use TVOC as an effect predictor, it affirms the usefulness of TVOC for characterizing indoor pollution and for improving source control as required from the points of view of health, comfort, energy efficiency and sustainability.

AB This article provides models for evaluating the business value of IS quality. Business quality is defined as the net value of an information system for the user organisation. Thus, it is affected by the cost of planning, developing, maintaining and using the system, and by the benefits achieved through systems use. The article identifies ways IS work quality and IS user quality can influence the business quality of information systems. However, it is acknowledged that a high quality information system is not alone sufficient. To ensure business quality, integrative processes between IS professionals and business managers/analysts are needed. The article assists practising managers in evaluating and improving the business quality of their information systems. For information systems research, the article provides models for explaining and measuring the business value of information systems quality. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB This paper highlights the ethnobotanical uses of some plants by the Jaunsari tribes of Chakrata Tehsil in the Dehra Dun district. The Jaunsari tribe of Jaunsar-Bawar is a primitive group of people who have their own culture, custom and traditions. The region is quite rich in plant wealth. Living close to nature the tribals use a number of wild plants such as Aesculus indica, Asparagus filicinus, Berberis chitria, Bidens biternata, Cannabis sativa, Cinnamomum tamala, Cissampelos pareira, Crotalaria spectabilis, Cryptolepis buchananii, Datura stramonium, Oxalis corniculata, Rumex nepalensis, Solanum ferox, Thalictrum foliolosum, Viola canescens, Zanthoxylum armatum etc., to fill their day to day requirements. Local names, habits and flowering periods are provided for each species. The family names (in parentheses) are followed by detailed uses. Finally the authors emphasize the urgent need to document and develop databases on the ethnobotanical uses of the area's plants so that the local inhabitants can improve their socio-economic condition while using them in a sustainable manner.

DE sustainability; decision-making; criteria; fairness; reversibility; risk
AB The new paradigm of sustainability necessitates revisions to traditional decision-making processes. This paper, which is the first in a series of four, outlines the changes required for decision-making to reflect sustainability concerns. Three sustainability criteria, that are the focus of the three subsequent papers, are introduced and the rationale for each is explained. A framework for incorporating the three sustainability criteria into the decision-making process is briefly outlined. The paper ends with the introduction to a case study, the North Central Project (NCP) for electricity supply alternatives. The NCP is used in the three following papers to demonstrate the individual components of the new approach to sustainable decision-making.

TI Distributive fairness as a criterion for sustainability: evaluative
   measures and application to project selection
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND WORLD ECOLOGY

DT Article
DE sustainability; decision-making; criteria; distributive fairness
ID EQUITY; INEQUALITY; EQUALITY
AB In evaluating civil engineering projects and management alternatives, the distribution of project impacts among groups in the same generation (intratemporal impact distributions) and between groups in different generations (intertemporal impact distributions) may be used as indicators of project viability and potential sustainability. Empirical measures of distributive fairness among groups at one point in time have typically been applied in project selection. These measures are often based on one of three views of fairness, namely allocation of impacts based on equality, equity, or need. The appropriateness of these measures for different applications may be determined based on whether they meet a set of required characteristics. This paper classifies the common distributive fairness measures for impact distributions at one point in time, describes the required characteristics of each measure, and extends these measures for considering impact distributions that are experienced over time. New measures of intratemporal and intertemporal distributive fairness are suggested and the challenge of evaluating these in a long time horizon is discussed. The application of distributive fairness measures to the selection of an electricity supply project is then presented.

AB Integration of sustainability issues into the project selection process requires new approaches to decision-making. A framework is proposed for measuring reversibility as one component for achieving this goal. Reversibility in the context of this research is defined as the degree to which the aggregated set of anticipated or unanticipated impacts of a development project can be mitigated. Several concepts found in the sustainable development literature are used in the framework. The efficacy of the framework is tested in a case study involving construction of hydropower transmission and distribution lines.

DE sustainability; decision-making; criteria; risk
AB Sustainable decision-making requires consideration of technology, ecology, and the social and political infrastructure of society. While it may never be possible to identify with certainty what is sustainable and what is not, an attempt has been made in this paper to formulate a measure that permits one to compare the performances of project alternatives with respect to risk. An algorithm is presented for the evaluation of a risk criterion that can be used with other criteria in the process of selecting project alternatives. The intent of the risk criterion is to involve project stakeholders in the process of quantifying the risks associated with different project alternatives.

TI Ecologies: anthropology, culture and the environment
SO INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL SCIENCE JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB This article describes anthropology's distinctive perspective on the relationship between human societies and their environments and its relation to contemporary environmental discourse. Early approaches in ecological anthropology were characterized by varying degrees of environ mental determinism, but from the late 1950s two new approaches were developed. The ecosystem approach, adopted from biology, examined the role of human populations in ecological systems, and the study of 'ethnoecology', within the broader field of cognitive anthropology, examined people's cultural perspectives on the environment. The focus on cultural perspectives fostered an extreme form of cultural relativism which has recently been challenged from both within and outside the discipline. Anthropologists have also, in recent years, attacked the modernist dichotomies (between thought and action, mind and body, culture and nature) which have been fundamental to Western science. These trends are shaping anthropology's role in contemporary environmental discourse. In a technical sense, anthropological knowledge can be used in addressing specific environmental problems and in the search for sustainable ways of living. In addition, the nature of anthropological theory gives the discipline an implicit position in the environmental debate: one which favours local rather than global control of environmental resources and the conservation of cultural diversity as a strategy for survival.

AB Aphelinid parasitoids have been used for control of pests in greenhouses since the 1920s, but large scale application started only some 25 years ago. Today, several aphelinid parasitoids are commercially used for the biological control of scale, aphid and whitefly pests in greenhouses. A success story is the biological control of greenhouse whitefly, Trialeurodes vaporariorum, with the aphelinid Encarsia formosa. Encarsia is applied on 5000 ha of vegetable crops worldwide. Weekly, more than 20 million individuals of E. formosa are mass reared and shipped to growers in 20 countries. About 10 years ago, another whitefly species, Bemisia sp., developed to pest status and a search for control of scales and aphids in greenhouses is summarized, as well as the status of commercial biological control with aphelinid parasitoids. Further, the questions whether effective natural enemies can be identified before introduction and if autoparasitoids should be imported and released are addressed. Finally, the usefulness of parasitoid biotype studies to recognize suitable candidates for biological is considered.

TI Estimating time to detect time trends in continuous cropping
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED STATISTICS
LA English
DT Article
AB In long-term field trials comparing different sequences of crops and husbandry practices, the identification and understanding of trends in productivity over time is an important issue of sustainable crop production. This paper presents a statistical technique for the estimation of time trends in yield variables of a seasonal annual crop under continuous cropping. The estimation procedure incorporates the correlation structure, which is assumed to follow first-order autocorrelation in the errors that arise over time on the same plot. Because large differences in annual rainfall have a major effect on crop performance, rainfall has been allowed for in the estimation of the time trends. Expressions for the number of years (time) required to detect statistically significant time trends have been obtained. Illustrations are based on a 7-year data set of grain and straw yields from a trial in northern Syria. Although agronomic interpretation is not intended in this paper, the barley yield data indicated that a significant time trend can apparently be detected even in a suboptimal data set of 7 years' duration.

AB Desertification was reported in the Sahel during the higher rainfall regime of the 1950s and has become increasingly evident as human and livestock populations increase as a result of medical and veterinary care, which has created ever increasing population pressures for food, fodder, fuel, etc. The Great Drought of the mid 1960s and the ensuing lower rainfall has further aggravated the situation. With the help of NGO projects rural communities should be able to combat desertification and maintain a sustainable agriculture/livestock economy. The urban situation is undoubtedly extremely difficult if not beyond salvation. The future effects of climatic change is uncertain. (C) 1997 Academic Press Limited.

ID INTEGRATION
AB This paper examines strategies for peaceful coexistence in the African countries, more effective participation of the African economies in the global economy, and sustainable economic growth and development in the new century and beyond. Three strategies are recommended: development in each country of an efficient and self-enforcing constitution; constitutional guarantee of economic freedoms, including the right of individuals to freely engage in exchange and contract; and a change in present trading patterns. Presently, most African countries export raw materials, forest products, minerals, and goods produced with cheap, unskilled and primarily uneducated labor. The paper recommends that African countries move away from specialization in the export of primary commodities towards specialization in the production of knowledge intensive goods using skilled and educated labor services. National policies in these countries should be directed at providing facilities for citizens to acquire the specialized skills and knowledge needed to help these countries switch to knowledge intensive industries.

ID RAIN-FOREST; EXTRACTIVE RESERVES; ECONOMIC VALUE; STRATEGIES
AB Although this article is about placing a value on rainforest, it begins by stressing the importance and value of rainforest for its environmental function, particularly for the control of world climate patterns. It is then shown how rainforest peoples depend on the plants around them and in some study areas were found to have a use for every tree on the one-hectors plots. It is therefore not surprising that he rainforest can contain many non-timber forest products (NTFPs) of commercial potential, some of which such as rubber latex and Brazil nuts have been ih the market economy for many-years. A summary is given of various-attempts to place a value on rainforest for its NTFPs. Each of the three studies showed that the extraction of these products could be more valuable than alternative land uses involving deforestation. Various rainforest countries such as Brazil, Guatemala, and Indonesia have set up extractive reserves where local people are allowed to extract NTFPs but not to clear cut the forest. Extractive reserves have slowed down deforestation in some areas, but only provide a meagre subsistence existence for their inhabitants, so while they are useful, they are not a panacea that will solve all the conservation problems of tropical rainforest.

DE camel milk; Kenya; preservation; school children
AB In the Arid and Semi-Arid lands of Kenya upto half a million primary school children have received supplementary food provided by the World Food Programme. The sustainability of this exercise has been called into question and community based alternatives were sought. Health workers at the African Medical Research Foundation and the Africa Inland Church identified inadequate milk supplied from cattle as contributory factor to poor attendance and performance at a Maasai and a Samburu school. FARM-Africa was requested to supply female camels so as to provide supplementary milk as needed. Four schools have been assisted to date with 48 camels most of which were females. Monitoring of the performance of the camels at three of the schools (all in the FARM working area in Marsabit District) has been carried out and the results are presented. During school vacations milk is either sold to nearby residence and the proceeds used for school bursaries or it is preserved by condensation for use during the next term. This paper presents the results of chemical analysis of the condensed milk product indicating that the loss of some proteins and vitamin A during preparation are the major points of concern. Suggestions for its improvement are made. The school milk scheme using camel milk is popular and FARM-Africa is currently seeking funds to supply six more schools which have applied for assistance.

ID ECONOMIC-GROWTH; ENVIRONMENTAL-QUALITY; MODEL
AB Potential conflicts between economic growth and environmental degradation are central to the sustainable development debate. An endogenous growth model is used to investigate tradeoffs between economic growth and environmental quality, where growth is dependent on technology improvements, emissions are generated during final goods production, and physical resources can be used to abate pollution. Pollution growth is higher in a decentralized economy, but technology growth rates can not be ranked between the efficient and equilibrium paths. Even with restricted abatement activity, second-best pollution growth will be below the unregulated level. Zero economic growth policies may increase the rate of environmental degradation.

TI Optimal taxes without commitment
SO JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC THEORY
LA English
DT Article
ID REDISTRIBUTIVE TAXATION; GENERAL EQUILIBRIUM; MODEL; POLICY; PLANS
AB In the problem of optimal taxation in an economy with labor and capital, the optimal solution when the government can commit to a sequence of tax rates entails that the tax on capital tends to zero in the limit, with all the tax burden on labor. It is well known, however, that this solution is time inconsistent; so if the commitment power is not perfect, this second best tax plan will not be sustainable. We model explicitly the trade-off between the cost of revising the tax plan, and the benefit of the revision. As a result, when commitment is not possible, both the limit tax rate and the steady state capital are different from their levels in the second best solution Limit taxes on capital may be strictly positive; but it may also be the case that the only sustainable plan has subsidies to capital. The subsidies induce an overaccumulation of capital, which becomes a commitment device against revisions of the tax plan. (C) 1997 Academic Press.

TI Power generation potential of biomass gasification systems
SO JOURNAL OF ENERGY ENGINEERING-ASCE
LA English
DT Article
AB Biomass has the potential to contribute a significant portion of the electricity consumed in industrialized nations and a major share of the power mix in developing countries. In addition to providing an alternative to fossil-fuel-based energy and creating new markets for agriculture, a renewable resource like biomass used in a sustainable fashion facilitates closure of the carbon cycle. To realize these benefits, particularly in the shadow of uncertainties cast by deregulation and recent changes in federal energy and agricultural policies, biomass power systems must be competitive with incumbent power-generation technologies in terms of generation efficiency and overall cost. Anticipated performance and cost of biomass-based integrated gasification, combined-cycle power systems are discussed. The electric power that can be generated worldwide using existing biomass resources (primarily crop residues and wastes) and the potential amount that could be generated from crops grown specifically for electricity generation are projected. Technical and economic obstacles that must be overcome before advanced biomass-power systems based on aeroderivative turbines or fuel cells can become fully commercial are identified. Research, development, and demonstration efforts under way or being planned to overcome those obstacles are described; developments in a major biomass gasification demonstration project taking place in Hawaii under the auspices of the U.S. Department of Energy and the State of Hawaii are detailed.

TI Send waste management in Nairobi city: Knowledge and attitudes
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
ID HEALTH
AB The continual influx of people from rural areas and small towns to Nairobi has more than doubled the population of the city in the last 10 years. Population growth has overwhelmed the city's ability to deliver necessary social services. Despite service fees intended to keep the city clean and provide residents with social services, Such services are rarely delivered. Once known as ''The Green City in the Sun,'' Nairobi-has lost its beauty to heaps of uncollected garbage.
   Researchers at the University of Nairobi, Department of Community Health conducted a solid waste management assessment in 1994. A total of 662 Nairobi residents were interviewed to establish the factors underlying poor solid waste management. The findings indicate that waste is not collected 60 percent of the time. Furthermore, 91 percent of the respondents were not provided with Nairobi City Council (NCC) waste storage receptacles and resorted to indiscriminate dumping. At present, the environmental :conditions are deplorable, and the residents are dissatisfied with the quality of NCC's social services, particularly solid waste management.
   Results of the study suggest that lack of skilled and technical human resources, poor management of finances and resources, and laxity among employees are the major contributing factors. Also, residents show little concern for the cleanliness of their City and tend to believe that the NCC has sole responsibility for solid waste management. Over 50 percent of the study's participants proposed a participatory approach as a sustainable solution to the problem. Such an approach would make NCC accountable to the public for its use of taxpayers' money and service fees; if accountability is not achieved, the public would be allowed to take the necessary legal action.

AB Quantitative analysis of physical, chemical and biological data of the intertidal zone in Kuwait was undertaken to develop an integrated basis for assessing and protecting this sensitive coastal ecosystem. Cluster analyses were performed to determine the resemblance between the sampling stations based on the sediment composition, the benthic macrofauna and the physico-chemical characteristics of the intertidal sediment/water.
   Five distinct sub-environments were delineated within the intertidal zone of Kuwait. Each sub-environment was described in terms of number of taxa, mean density of organisms, sediment type, tidal level and dominant organisms. The physico-chemical parameters investigated were found to be unimportant in the distribution of the intertidal benthic macrofauna. On the other hand, sediment type was found to be a major factor in the overall composition of the benthic community. The benthic fauna and related characteristics of the subenvironments could be used as indicators to monitor changes in the intertidal ecosystem and as guides to protection and management of the different coasts. The approach described in this paper could also be adopted elsewhere to provide a sound basis for evaluating environmental impacts and for developing sustainable coastal management.

AB Multivariate analysis of variance, canonical correlation and canonical discriminate analysis were performed on environmental data collected from the Kuwaiti intertidal zone to determine the statistical relationships between the sediment, chemical, biological, spatial and temporal variables.
   The quantitative analysis showed that the sediment type was the paramount factor influencing the distribution and composition of the intertidal benthic fauna. The muddy, sandy and rocky shores support three distinct faunal communities. The seasonal variation in the benthic fauna community was not statistically significant but variation in biological data due to differences in transect location and tidal level were significant. This spatial variation has been attributed to differences in sediment and substrate types. The physicochemical parameters were found to correlate positively with the mud content of the sediments but were unimportant in the overall composition of the intertidal fauna. This paper complements the results reported in Al Bakri et al. (1997-Part I) in establishing a valuable benchmark for assessing environmental impacts and for developing sustainable coastal zone management in Kuwait. The integrated approach outlined here could be adopted to develop a sound basis for the protection and management of coastal environments and resources in similar areas.

AB Properties of candesartan cilexetil Candesartan is a novel, potent, highly selective antagonist of the angiotensin II receptor subtype 1, which is administered orally as candesartan cilexetil, and is rapidly and completely hydrolysed into candesartan, the active moiety, during absorption in the intestinal tract. At a dose of 4-16 mg once a day, candesartan cilexetil significantly lowers systolic and diastolic blood pressure in a clear dose-dependent fashion, with 16 mg showing the greatest effect. This blood pressure fall is sustained throughout the 24-h period, as shown by a trough to peak ratio in excess of 80%, across all doses. The recommended maintenance dose for first-line monotherapy in patients with essential hypertension is 8 or 16 mg.
   Comparison with other antihypertensive drugs In controlled, well designed, clinical trials involving more than 5000 subjects with mild to moderate hypertension, candesartan cilexetil at 4-8 mg was as effective as enalapril at 10-20 mg. At 8 mg, candesartan cilexetil was as effective as 50 mg losartan, and also showed equivalent efficacy to 5 mg amlodipine and 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide. In addition, candesartan cilexetil has an additive antihypertensive effect when used in combination with amlodipine or hydrochlorothiazide, also when tested in patients with severe hypertension.
   Adverse-event profile The adverse-event profile with candesartan cilexetil was similar to that with placebo, with no evidence of dose-dependent adverse events. The drug was equally well tolerated by men and women and by elderly (greater than or equal to 65 years) and younger (< 65 years) patients alike.
   Conclusions Effective and sustainable blood pressure control in patients with essential hypertension can be achieved with candesartan cilexetil in doses of 8 or 16 mg once a day without drug-related adverse events. This agent is therefore a promising alternative to established modern antihypertensive agents. (C) Rapid Science Publishers.

AB Twenty-two cover crops were evaluated for their ability to reduce damage by root-knot nematode, Meloidogyne javanica, to taro, Colocastia esculenta, in a tropical cropping system. Cover crops were grown and incorporated into the soil before tare was planted. Barley, greenpanic, glycine, marigold, sesame, sunn hemp, and sorghum x sudangrass DeKalb ST6E were poor or nonhosts to the nematode as measured by low population changes of nematodes in soil between cover crop planting and tare planting. Alfalfa, buckwheat, cowpea, lablab, Lana vetch, mustard, oat, okra, rhodes grass, ryegrain, ryegrass, siratro, sweet corn, and wheat allowed nematode populations to increase dramatically. Tare yields were greatest in the marigold plots and lowest in the ryegrain plots. Tare corm weight decreased with increasing initial nematode population (Pi) (r = 0.22, P = 0.056). Siratro, ryegrass, and Blizzard wheat plots had higher tare yield than plots with similar Pi's but planted to other cover crops. These cover crops may have antagonism to other soil microorganisms or their decomposition products may be toxic or adversely affect the nematodes. Cover crops can be an effective and valuable nematode management tactic for use in minor tropical cropping systems such as tare.

AB Effects of yard waste compost and maize (Zea mays) cultivar on population densities of plant-parasitic nematodes were examined in four experiments in north Florida. In one experiment, eight maize cultivars were evaluated; the other three experiments involved split-plot designs with compost treatments as main plots and maize cultivars as subplots. The three compost treatments used in these experiments were: 269 mt/ha of a yard waste compost applied to the soil surface as a mulch, 269 mt/ha of compost incorporated into the soil, and an unamended control. No interactions between compost treatment and cultivar occurred in any experiment. Effects of compost treatment on Mesocriconema spp., Meloidogyne incognita, and Pratylenchus spp. were inconsistent, whereas significant effects of compost on population densities of Paratrichodorus minor were found on four of six sampling occasions. Cultivar affected final population densities (Pf) of M. imcognita. In two tests, Pf of M. incognita on a Florida subtropical experimental hybrid (Howard III) were only 36% and 23% of Pf on the standard tropical hybrid (Pioneer Brand X304C). In an integrated approach to management of nematodes in maize, the effects of compost amendment and cultivar choice acted independently. Apparently, cultivar choice is more important than amendment with yard waste compost for management of M. incognita population levels in a maize rotation crop.

AB RNA viruses, including retroviruses, have mutation rates that are about 100 times higher than those of DNA viruses bacteria, or eukaryotes, so that resistance to AIDS drugs emerges very rapidly. This has been shown to limit the effectiveness of the treatment of AIDS by reverse transcriptase inhibitors, such as zidovudine (AZT) and resistance to the new class of HIV aspartyl protease inhibitors has already been reported. The technique of pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic simulation has now been used to predict ways of delaying the development of resistance to these two classes of antiretroviral agents. A model is described that includes pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and cytokinetic equations, and expressions describing effects of the HIV on the immune system and destruction of virally, infected cells by cellular immunity. The model predicted that the degree of viral drug resistance in relation to the sustainable blood level of drug would be the major determinant of response duration. Early treatment was consistently superior to late treatment, both with a drug that caused cumulative toxicity and with a drug that did not. Making reasonable assumptions about the likely degree of viral resistance, in conjunction with typical blood levels achievable for reverse transcriptase inhibitors or aspartyl protease inhibitors led to predicted response durations of several months to a few years, despite the rapid mutation rate of HIV. Preliminary studies of combination chemotherapy showed that predicted response durations were greater than for monotherapy, though less than the sum of responses to the individual drugs. Strategies for delaying the development of resistance include early treatment, combination chemotherapy, and developing novel agents with a high ratio of plasma level to antiviral efficacy.

AB Economic and social cohesion, sustainable development, and balanced competitiveness of the European territory are the arguments traditionally used in favor of a European spatial policy. This article focuses on documents and projects designed to lead toward an overall European Union spatial policy. It provides an overview of the content and the leading principles and indicates strengths and weaknesses of the emerging spatial policy as reflected in the documents Europe 2000, Europe 2000+, and the European Spatial Development Perspective. A European planning activity is considered to be acceptable ro the extent that it is complementary, empowers the local level, and coordinates the EU spatial activities.

AB There is a widespread consensus among economists that the goal of monetary policy, above all else, should be price stability. This study, by analyzing the Turkish experience in the last 15 years; emphasizes the-importance of coordination of fiscal and monetary policies in achieving this aim. It is shown that, despite the rapidly changing financial environment, there are stationary long-run money-income relationships. Moreover, the growth rates of various monetary aggregates have predictive power for future movements in the consumer price index. However, as the Turkish experience made clear, in an economy where there are persistent budget deficits, these properties are not sufficient to conduct a successful monetary policy. The sustainability of fiscal policy is analyzed and rejected. Next, in a medium-term perspective, the levels of sustainable budget deficits compatible with a declining inflation path are calculated by making use of a small macroeconometric model.

ID RAINBOW-TROUT; EXERCISE
AB Maximum levels of sustainable swimming activity rely on aerobic metabolism, and hence are limited by the cardiovascular supply capacity which is impaired at low temperatures. It is unclear to what extent species adapted to a continuous cold environment retain control of regional blood flow. Muscle blood flow (MBF) was therefore measured using the radiolabelled microsphere method in the Antarctic teleost Notothenia coriiceps and compared with data for trout at their preferred (optimal) temperatures of 0 degrees C and 11 degrees C, respectively. In resting fish, blood flow distribution to skeletal muscle was similar (around 8 ml/min/100 g), despite a lower cardiac output in Notothenia (7 vs. 27 ml/min). Following maximal exercise there was a significant increase in specific blood flow to slow, but not fast, muscle in both species. However, the relative hyperaemia was greater in trout (6.6- vs. 9.3-fold, respectively), with a similar relative increase in cardiac output (2.3- vs. 3.4-fold, respectively). The increase in blood flow to slow muscle, and decrease in peripheral resistance, during maximal exercise in trout (and hence regional O-2 delivery by convective transport) appears to be determined centrally. In contrast, reduced active redistribution from the viscera in Notothenia is presumably responsible for the attenuated increase in MBF on exercise. However, regional hyper- and hypoperfusion can occur within a single locomotory muscle, suggesting control of vascular lone is maintained. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Application of neural networks for regional system identification is reported in the context of sustainable development. Neural network I captures relationships among natural resource status, economic conditions, amenities, and environmental status; it is used for the prediction of environmental status resulting from the socioeconomic developmental alternatives. Neural network II predicts the quality of life levels. A geographic information system linked with an external relational database system maintained spatial and numerical data, and provided inputs to neural networks. The integrated system is used for consequence analysis of alternate developmental scenarios, and for the choice of a preferred scenario. The case of developmental planning in the national capital region of India is presented to illustrate the effectiveness of this modeling approach.

TI Strategic investment flexibility for MNE success in Russia: Evolving
   beyond entry modes
SO JOURNAL OF WORLD BUSINESS
LA English
DT Article
ID ECLECTIC PARADIGM; USSR
AB Many American multinational enterprises (MNEs) are currently active in Russia despite the turbulence encountered in that transitional economy. Most seem to have entered as an extension of their global strategies with a long-term horizon. While some entered with considerable involvement and substantial investment, others followed a moi-e cautious or incremental path. This article focuses on how MNE strategies have evolved after entry and describes six strategic approaches. Strategic investment flexibility is found to depend upon a company's original entry strategy and tolerance for risk, as well as its assessment of the legal and political environment, industry conditions, market readiness for its products or services, competition, and the investment required to establish a sustainable competitive position. Keys to successful strategy development are drawn from the experiences of US MNEs which have established growing businesses in the vast Russian market. The strategies of such successful MNEs, however initiated upon entry, usually evolved to a relatively heavy investment position.

AB To clarify static and dynamic properties in the circumferential direction of a tapered coupling joint, the relationship between loading torque and relative angle of torsion between a taper shank and a taper socket is determined for Morse tapers # 3, # 4 and # 5. Static properties such as torsional stiffness of a tapered coupling joint and maximum sustainable torque are strongly influenced by the contact state between the taper shank and the taper socket. Dynamic properties such as natural frequency and damping capacity are determined using an impulsive response test of the tapered coupling joint. These properties are also influenced by the contact state between the taper shank and the taper socket.

AB Effects of six slope lengths, 60 m to 10 m with 10-m increments, on soil physical properties were evaluated for plough-based conventional till and no-till seedbed preparation on field runoff plots for three consecutive years from 1984 to 1987. Soil physical properties measured included texture, bulk density, infiltration capacity, and soil moisture retention characteristics. Conventional till treatment caused a rapid increase in soil bulk density and penetration resistance, and decrease in available water capacity and equilibrium infiltration rate. Gravel content increased with cultivation duration. Soil bulk density of 0-5 cm depth was 1.20 Mg m(-3) for 1984, 1.39 Mg m(-3) for 1985 and 1.46 Mg m(-3) for 1986 for conventional till; and 1.13 Mg m(-3) for 1984, 1.33 Mg m(-3) for 1985, and 1.27 Mg m(-3) for 1986 for the no-till treatment. The penetration resistance of the no-till treatment was relatively low and increased with cultivation duration. Mean penetration resistance for 0-5 cm depth was 2.2 kg cm(-2) in 1984, 2.71 kg cm(-2) in 1985, and 3.79 kg cm(-2) in 1986. The available water capacity decreased in both tillage methods without any consistent trends with regard to slope length. The equilibrium infiltration rate declined drastically for long slopes and conventional till methods. The data support the conclusion that these soils should be managed with short slope lengths and a no-till method of seedbed preparation. (C) 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Sustainable land use planning creates a great challenge for rural road network planning. Further improvements of the network are a necessity, to provide for people's needs in the (near) future. Simultaneously, harmful effects of this network conflict with the principles of sustainability. So, there is a need for a new planning approach, serving interests of both accessibility and a sustainable environment. The spatial concept of the traffic-calmed rural area (TCRA) is presented as a solution to this dilemma. This concept concentrates on the present diffused flows on minor rural roads at a few rural highways, which resulted in a decrease of volumes and speeds within the region.

AB A study was undertaken to map and evaluate the role of rural landscapes in maintaining the physical environment of Japan. Over 80% of the land area of Japan is used for agriculture and forestry, and while their economic value is well known, they have additional value in preventing landslides and soil erosion as well as in increasing the water retention capability of soils and purifying air. These roles, or 'functions,' were investigated through the use of a geographic information system and previously-validated land evaluation models. The study defined the 'ecological value' of rural land uses by mapping the differences between scores that land would receive with actively managed woods and farms and those same lands if the woods and farms had been abandoned. The results were illustrated at a national scale, on a watershed basis, and provided both inter-and intra-prefecture comparisons. A national map was developed that utilized elements of landscape structure to model ecological functions based on potential land use change. These elements (structure, function, and change) are central to landscape ecology, and this map has provided a step toward achieving landscape sustainability. This map will assist planners in understanding the relative importance of the various ecological roles of land uses in the watershed and will clarify what land use changes can and cannot be made. This quantification of the beneficial effects of woods and farms on the physical environment has come at a critical time, as rural land uses in Japan art: being threatened by politics and economics. The results of this study will be of considerable benefit in landscape planning in Japan, but will also provide a prototype for the investigation of effects of open spaces elsewhere, especially in other Asian nations that share with Japan the characteristics of monsoons, rice production, and extreme physical environments.

AB Assessing the long-term sustainability of Atlantic white cedar (Chamaecyparis thyoides) wetlands in the New Jersey Pinelands is an important management concern. We used aerial photography dating from 1930 through 1991 and recent satellite imagery to quantify successional trends in these wetlands within the 1,473 km(2) Mullica River basin. Over the 61-yr period the composition of individual cedar patches in the study area changed in response to varying disturbance regimes but total cedar cover remained relatively stable. The dominant transitions were conversion of cedar to shrub cover and succession from shrub to cedar. Cedar harvesting, which was the dominant disturbance, was most intense during the early part of the study period. A decline in successful regeneration of more recent cedar cuts may be related to an increase in the Pinelands deer herd. Other major disturbances included wildfires and flooding. Most flooding was associated with beaver activity. Although the long-term effects of changing disturbance regimes are unknown, our results suggest a positive outlook for sustainability of Atlantic white cedar wetlands within the Mullica River basin. important management considerations that can affect cedar sustainability include effective post-harvest management of cut swamps and restoration of cedar in shrub or emergent dominated areas that historically contained cedar. Because hardwood conversion of undisturbed cedar patches was not a major transition, cedar harvesting to rejuvenate stands does not seem necessary to maintain Atlantic white cedar wetlands.

AB The breeding method has been used to generate perturbations for ensemble forecasting at the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (formerly known as the National Meteorological Center) since December 1992. At that time a single breeding cycle with a pair of bred forecasts was implemented. In March 1994, the ensemble was expanded to seven independent breeding cycles on the Gray C90 supercomputer, and the forecasts were extended to 16 days. This provides 17 independent global forecasts valid for two weeks every day.
   For efficient ensemble forecasting, the initial perturbations to the control analysis should adequately sample the space of possible analysis errors. It is shown that the analysis cycle is like a breeding cycle: it acts as a nonlinear perturbation model upon the evolution of the real atmosphere. The perturbation (i.e., the analysis error), carried forward in the first-guess forecasts, is ''scaled down'' at regular intervals by the use of observations. Because of this, growing errors associated with the evolving state of the atmosphere develop within the analysis cycle and dominate subsequent forecast error growth.
   The breeding method simulates the development of growing errors in the analysis cycle. A difference field between two nonlinear forecasts is carried forward (and scaled down at regular intervals) upon the evolving atmospheric analysis fields. By construction, the bred vectors are superpositions of the leading local (time-dependent) Lyapunov vectors (LLVs) of the atmosphere. An important property is that all random perturbations assume the structure of the leading LLVs after a transient period, which for large-scale atmospheric processes is about 3 days. When several independent breeding cycles are performed, the phases and amplitudes of individual (and regional) leading LLVs are random, which ensures quasi-orthogonality among the global bred vectors from independent breeding cycles.
   Experimental runs with a 10-member ensemble (five independent breeding cycles) show that the ensemble mean is superior to an optimally smoothed control and to randomly generated ensemble forecasts, and compares favorably with the medium-range double horizontal resolution control. Moreover, a potentially useful relationship between ensemble spread and forecast error is also found both in the spatial and time domain. The improvement in skill of 0.04-0.11 in pattern anomaly correlation for forecasts at and beyond 7 days, together with the potential for estimation of the skill, indicate that this system is a useful operational forecast tool.
   The two methods used so far to produce operational ensemble forecasts-that is, breeding and the adjoint (or ''optimal perturbations'') technique applied at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts-have several significant differences, but they both attempt to estimate the subspace of fast growing perturbations. The bred vectors provide estimates of fastest sustainable growth and thus represent probable growing analysis errors. The optimal perturbations, on the other hand, estimate vectors with fastest transient growth in the future. A practical difference between the two methods for ensemble forecasting is that breeding is simpler and less expensive than the adjoint technique.

AB Durable gene delivery to human skin is necessary for lasting correction of human genetic skin disease. Current cutaneous gene-delivery strategies, however, have achieved only transient gene expression, often only within a small percentage of tissue cells. The recent inability to sustain phenotypic correction of human genetic skin disease due to loss of therapeutic gene expression in regenerated epidermal tissue has highlighted this current limitation. In an effort to surmount this problem, we have generated gene delivery vectors that produce more durable gene delivery in human skin tissue in vivo.

AB The effects of composted amendments and soil fumigation with methyl bromide/chloropicrin on plant-parasitic nematodes were examined in a three-year split-plot field experiment on tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) in southwest Florida. Composted amendments included municipal solid waste, yard waste, and/or biosolids. Population densities of Meloidogyne incognita and root galling on tomato from this nematode were decreased (P less than or equal to 0.05) by soil fumigation, but increased (P less than or equal to 0.10) in response to compost amendment, with maximum levels in non-fumigated, compost-amended plots. Population densities of Criconemoides spp. and Hemicycliophora spp. were reduced by fumigation. Application of compost reduced population densities of Hemicycliophora spp. but did not affect Criconemoides spp. Numbers of Paratrichodorus minor were not affected by either treatment. Amendment with municipal solid waste compost was not an effective alternative to methyl bromide fumigation for management of the root-knot nematode in this site within the time-frame of the experiment.

AB Tropical rain forests are rich in plant and animal species. The sustainable extraction of non-timber forest products has been advocated as a strategy to best conserve this diversity. However, the development and implementation of such exploitation systems, which aim to reconcile conservation and economic development, are still hampered by the lack of information on the biological sustainability of these systems, the impact of these exploitation systems on the biological diversity and the insufficient knowledge of the role of forest products in the house-hold economy of forest dependent people and hence their prospects for economic development.
   Whether the exploitation of non-timber forest products from tropical rain forests is sustainable or not is still open to question, but data presently available on the biological, social and economic aspects of these extraction systems point at an interesting question: Does diversity come at a price? Namely, low density of conspecifics - and thus products - and hence low productivity for those involved in the collection of forest resources.
   The paper will further discuss whether domestication of forest species provide an alternative for some of these species? Species are part of a complex ecosystem and their functioning is partly depended on the presence of other species in the system. What are the attributes of the species which have to be taken into account in order to make domestication of forest species successful?
   Finally, the paper will return to the question: How to reconcile conservation and use of tropical rain forests? It will present a case for domesticating the forest instead of the species. Or in other words changing the forest composition without changing its structure and functioning, and maintaining acceptable levels of biodiversity.

AB The natural habitat of the oil palm comprises very wet and relatively dry niches in the lowland rain forest in West and Central Africa. The domestication of the oil palm started with the extraction of fruits from wild forest resources. When forests were cleared for shifting cultivation, oil palms were not felled and in the subsequent regeneration period they obtained a favourable position resulting in semi-wild palm groves. Thinning of groves gave rise to semi-permanent or permanent intercropping systems of palms and food crops.
   After the transfer of oil palm to S.E. Asia in the 19th century, a mono-crop oil palm evolved. Its success was based on a favourable climate, breeding, improved cultivation and processing practices and the absence of major pests and diseases. The high-yielding production systems are sustainable at high input levels and pollution can be kept within acceptable limits. Oil yields and production costs compare favourably to those from other oil crops.
   The domestication of oil palm for oil yield so far can be considered as a success story. Physiological studies indicate that there is still considerable scope for further increase in yield. The adaptation of oil palm to new environments will continue and produce diversification puts new demands on domestication.

TI Effect of crop rotation on the yield of maize at various nutrient supply
   levels in long-term field experiments
SO NOVENYTERMELES
LA Hungarian
DT Article
AB Crop rotation is a classical element in sustainable, low input agriculture. A wise choice of the proportion and order of crops grown means that the water and nutrient reserves of the soil can be preserved or increased, while the utilisation of the nutrients in the mineral and organic fertilisers applied can be regulated. In addition plant protection costs can also be reduced.
   The long-term experiments on the effect of crop sequence which have been underway on chernozem brown forest soil in Kompolt since 1962 provide answers to questions of present and future interest in line with the international trend towards drawing practical conclusions from the results of long-term experiments (Workshop 1996).
   The effect of crop sequence on soil fertility was determined using maize as indicator plant. A maize monoculture and a crop rotation involving four crops were examined with 2x9 fertiliser treatments (for nutrient rates see Figures 1 and 2) on the basis of the following agronomic factors:
   -type and quantity of nutrient, method of application;
   -crop sequence.
   These factors contribute jointly to the fertility of the soil. The individual factors are in synergistic relationship with the soil and with each other. In Table 2 the effects of crop sequence, mineral fertilisation and stable manuring are analysed by means of variance analysis for the full factorial design on the basis of the maize yields obtained over 7 experimental cycles.
   Figure 1 illustrates correlations between the nutrient levels applied in the experiment and the maize yields in the monoculture and in the 4-crop sequence. Of the nine treatments included in the figure, M-1/2d, M-1d, M-3/2d and M-2d represent periodically applied nutrient rates (4 years with and 4 years without fertilisation) equivalent to the M-1, M-2, M-3 and M-4 rates. It can be seen from the established trend that the nutrient application system caused no significant yield difference in either crop sequence. According to marginal analysis the optimum points exhibited considerable differences for the two crop sequences. In the maize monoculture the upper limit of the nutrient rate can be determined in the 1 1/2-2 times interval (175.5-234 kg/ha mixed NPK active agents, with an optimum value of 218 kg/ha) based on the analysis of the nutrient - yield function.
   For the 4-crop sequence the marginal optimum (Fig. 1) was 30 kg/ha mixed active agents. Figure 2 illustrates the correlation between crop sequence and nutrient rate as the difference between the two functions plotted in Figure 1.
   The effect of crop sequence was greatest in the non-fertilised treatment and smallest in the treatment with the highest rate of fertiliser. It is thus clear why crop rotation has regained its popularity in farms using a low rare of fertilisation, while in production systems which can afford a plentiful supply of fertilisers it is of little or no importance.
   It is also worth noting that different yield levels can be achieved with the same fertiliser rates as a function purely of the crop sequence. However, nutrients applied to compensate for unfavourable crop sequences are not incorporated into the plants and have been proved to pollute the environment (Gefer 1997).
   The processing and analysis of the data obtained in long-term experiments in Kompolt is designed not only to broaden our knowledge, but also to serve as a basis for the elaboration of models for practical decisions adapted to the changed economic environment. The present paper emphasises the economic advantages of crop rotation, which are proved by statistical analysis.

TI Integrated crop-livestock systems in sub-Saharan Africa: an option or an
   imperative?
SO OUTLOOK ON AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
AB Rapid growth of the human and livestock populations in sub-Saharan Africa is creating un precedented increases in food and feed demands. These population pressures on a fixed landbase are likely to promote severe competition for resources and drive agriculture progressively towards intensification, Integrated crop-livestock systems, already common in the highlands, are expected to evolve rapidly elsewhere. Research is required to develop technological alternatives which promote better resource use through synergies from crop-livestock integration. Maintenance of soil fertility and provision of livestock feeds appear to be the main areas of reciprocal benefits, while animal traction may be an option for increasing land and labour productivity, In this paper we assess the challenge facing sub-Saharan agriculture and the potential contribution of crop-livestock integrated systems towards agricultural growth and sustainability.

SO OUTLOOK ON AGRICULTURE

DT Article
AB Integrated crop-animal systems are important in Asia. Both ruminants and non-ruminants are used in a variety of combinations with annual and perennial crops in Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, China and Sri Lanka. These combined systems provide distinct economic benefits, and are more compatible with ecological and environmental sustainability. Increased investment in these systems is likely and research is needed on feed resources,use of indigenous animal genetic resources and livestock disease to increase livestock production. In addition, available research results should be applied and enabling policies developed to promote increased investment in livestock production and natural resource use and management in the rainfed warm humid/subhumid and arid/semiarid tropics.

AB Motivated by the issue of whether it is possible to construct phenomenologically viable models where the electroweak symmetry breaking is triggered by new physics at a scale Lambda much greater than 4 tau upsilon, where upsilon is the order parameter of the transition (upsilon similar to 250 GeV) and Lambda is the scale of new physics, we have studied the phase diagram of the U(2)XU(2) model. This is the relevant low energy effective theory for a class of models which will be discussed below. We find that the phase transition in these models is first order in most of parameter space. The order parameter cannot be made much smaller than the cutoff and, consequently, a large hierarchy does not appear sustainable. In the relatively small region in the space of parameters where the phase transition is very weakly first order or second order the model effectively reduces to the O(8) theory for which the triviality considerations should apply.

TI The French strategy for the management of plant genetic resources
SO PLANT VARIETIES AND SEEDS
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper presents the guidelines of the French Strategy for the management of plant genetic resources, including tropical and forest species. It emphasizes the need to link both process of conservation and valorization of genetic resources, but also to rationalize the choice of resources to be maintained and to allow progressive evaluation of collections.
   The paper describes the organization of conservation and evaluation of genetic resources in France, through networks of partners. It presents the genetic material currently considered within French national collections and gives the addresses of the different co-ordinators of these collections. It also emphasizes the need for methods to reduce the gap between old genetic resources and elite varieties.
   All previous activities contribute directly to the implementation of the FAO Global Plan of Action for the conservation and sustainable utilization of plant genetic resources for food and agriculture, at national, regional and international levels.

AB We studied the optimal age-dependent harvesting of a natural resource population that achieves a maximum income under the constraint of sustainability, i.e. the reproductive adults numbers must exceed a given minimum. The resource species is assumed to be semelparous (a single reproduction over a life). The economic value and natural mortality coefficient can vary with age. The optimal age-dependent harvesting under the sustainability constraint is obtained using Pontryagin's maximum principle. The constraint of resource sustainability can be treated as an additional term measured in the same units as economic income. Specifically, three terms: (1) current harvesting value, (2) future harvesting value, and (3) sustainability value, are calculated for each age, and the resources should be harvested at the maximum rate when their current harvesting value is greater than the sum of future harvesting value and sustainability value, and should not be harvested otherwise. Numerical analyses of several cases demonstrated that the optimal harvesting schedule depends critically on the natural mortality coefficient and the functional form of the economic value of the resource.

AB Recent studies have found an inverse correlation between economic growth and natural resource abundance among developing countries, There appears to be no obvious explanation for this finding, such as an important growth variable that is common in resource-poor countries and deficient in resource-abundant countries. The resource curse hypothesis is closely related to the problem of sustainability for resource-exporting countries since periods of high growth are frequently followed by long periods of stagnation, Models are examined showing how increases in export income can affect relative prices in the trade and nontrade sectors and how the changes in relative prices affect investment and growth. It is the thesis of this article that there is nothing inherent in resource-abundance that condemns countries to either low growth or nonsustainability. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

SO RESTORATION ECOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID DYNAMICS; CALIFORNIA; ECOSYSTEM; COMMUNITY; PATHWAYS; RECOVERY; ECOLOGY;
   FIRES
AB Successional models are used to predict how restoration projects will achieve their goals. These models have been developed on different spatial and temporal scales and consequently emphasize different types of dynamics. This paper focuses on the restoration goal of self-sustainability, but only in the context of a long-term goal. Because of the temporal scale of this goal, we must consider the impact of processes arising outside of the restoration site as of greater importance than restoration itself. Because ecological systems are open, restoration sites will be subjected to many external influential processes. Depending on the landscape context, the impact of these processes may not be noticeable, or, at the other extreme, they may prevent the achievement of restoration objectives. A second issue is to emphasize the nature of processes in the long term, that they are a complex of characteristics such as magnitude, frequency, and extent. Ecological systems are only adapted to a range of values in each of these characteristics. Restoration often combines goals that are of different scales. Models appropriate to these goals need consideration.

AB This paper argues that policies to promote sustainable development which are formulated around attempts to objectify what is or is not sustainable in any specific circumstance are impotent and ill-conceived. Using the case of forest exploitation in the Malaysian state of Sarawak as an example, we suggest that progress in the theory and practice of sustainable development depends on a more adequate understanding of the causes of unsustainability. In Sarawak, development has involved a clear tendency towards increasingly profound forms of exploitation. A realist mode of explanation allows the mechanisms through which this tendency is expressed to be better understood. Identifying these mechanisms and understanding why and how increasingly exploitative and degrading practices are legitimated and empowered is crucial to understanding why and how unsustainable outcomes are produced and how they might be more effectively prevented.

AB Growing awareness of the linkages between socioeconomic, ecological and human community health across various spatial and temporal scales has uncovered contradictions and ambiguities in the concept of health. Furthermore, conventional modes of inquiry are limited in their ability to handle these difficulties and may, indeed, reinforce them. Based on research into agroecosystems, and drawing on recent developments in our understanding of complex systems and what has been called post-normal science, a new type of question for health analysis is proposed. The question "Are the quality and quantity of internal and external resources sufficient, and is their organization appropriate for the system to meet its goals?" is implicitly integrative, context-sensitive, and attuned to emergent complexity. Unraveling the assumptions and implications of this question shifts the debate away from the causes of a particular disease to an exploration of the primary and operative goals inherent in the functioning of the system under investigation. It also becomes the basis for determining the roots of health problems and therefore pointing out what needs to be altered for improved health status. Using examples from research into agroecosystem health, the potential contributions of this new approach to health analysis are explored. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

SO SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE

ID MOTOR-NEURON DISEASE; TANZANIA
AB Konzo is an irreversible paralytic disease afflicting tens of thousands of women and children in rural Zaire and throughout sub-Sahara Africa. The disease can occur where bitter, high-yield varieties of cassava that thrive in arid soils provide the basic nutritional staple. The paraparesis is related to upper motor neuron damage stemming from the consumption of insufficiently processed toxic cassava roots (manioc) and a diet poor in the sulfur-based amino acids necessary for the body to detoxify the cyanide in this plant. The ecological paradigm [Kelly (1968) Toward an ecological conception of preventive interventions, in Research Contributions from Psychology to Community Mental Health, ed. J. W. Carter, pp. 75-99, Behavioral Publications, New York] is adapted as the evaluative model for evaluating the potential effectiveness of a proposed health behavior/education intervention for konzo. This qualitative research model involves a consideration of the cycling of resources (human labor and material), adaptation (of personal and social practices related to the health issue), succession (of social institutions, values, customs), interdependence (of human social units), and feasibility (or the congruency of the proposed intervention and cultural traits of the host environment). Based on this evaluative model, a health behavior/education level of intervention focusing specifically on using focus groups and multichannel communication techniques to discourage unsafe manioc short-soaking tendencies among village women farmers seems feasible. Such an approach is not dependent on sophisticated technical or material inputs and is therefore readily sustainable without outside agency support once it is effectively initiated within that culture.

AB This paper examines the case that farmers need new skills and knowledge if environmentally sustainable agriculture is to be achieved. The first part of the paper looks at policy transition in agriculture in England, examining the extent to which agricultural policy is now environmentally driven. Secondly, the nature of knowledge is subject to examination. This section is more speculative and suggestive leading to the third element in this paper - the need to bring farmers back into the analysis. In both policy analysis and the literature of technology transfer there is a danger that farmers are seen merely as passive recipients and not active participants. The importance of farmers' own knowledge is stressed in a call for fresh research and a fundamental re-orientation of the current debate on technology transfer in agriculture.

AB A common assumption in traditional strategic management thinking is that competitive success may be achieved by the creation and protection of firm-specific factors, either favourable market positions, as in industrial organization-based frameworks, or unique resources, such as intellectual property and tacit knowledge, as in resource-based frameworks. This paper long-term trends in technology, industries and society, this paradigm is no longer appropriate for modern knowledge-based industries, particularly emerging high-technology industries. In these industries technologies and firms are increasingly interconnected in a complex web of interactions, and the main task of strategic management is one of managing technological and industry co-evolution. Complexity theory is used to identify mechanisms and strategies for creating sustainable technological communities and industries.

AB In recent years, a growing awareness of the environmental impacts of transport has played a major part in the shift towards policies to manage the demand for travel. As a result, a substantial increase in the role of public transport has been identified as necessary in any strategy towards more environmentally sustainable transport patterns. At the same time there has been a quite separate process of deregulation and the withdrawal of the state from the transport market. These two trends appear to represent potentially contradictory processes. This article draws upon two major studies that explore the relationship between increasing needs for environmental regulation and the privatisation of bus and rail services. It is shown that, as currently organised in Britain, the development of bus and rail services are inadequately linked to strategic environmental policymaking and, rather than being part of the solution to transport's environmental impacts, there is a real danger that these 'green' methods of transport could slide into simply being part of the problem itself. It is concluded that privatisation and deregulation does not mean the end of the need for policy mechanisms, but they do mean that policy has to be implemented in a very different way.

SO URBAN STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
ID ECOSYSTEM MANAGEMENT; SUSTAINABILITY; SCIENCE
AB Brief analyses are made of both the Portuguese planning system and the project environmental impact assessment (EIA) system, Major trends in planning practice are characterised and the scope for bargaining processes is critically addressed, The procedural and institutional separation between these systems is emphasised, A contrast is made between the localised nature of planning practice and the independent centralised approach to environmental assessment in Portugal, In this contest, a case study of the planning application for a large tourism development condominium, involving the preparation of an environmental assessment, is presented, A contradictory framework for bargaining emerges out of this case, The search for scientific evidence to support the decision-making process is impaired by changing environmental arguments throughout a long administrative process, Diverging local development interests versus national conservation interests are explored and a strong case for a collaborative approach is justified. Finally, evidence is gathered to support the view that the separation between the planning system and the EIA system create a disjointed framework for bargaining, in which the developer is bound to perform a difficult and somehow secondary mitigated role.

AB This paper provides a framework of analysis of economic markets in stateless Somalia. It argues that the informal market that sustained private sector activities under the repressive policies of Siad Barre's government has provided a functioning system to the economy. In small communities that achieved internal law and order, their economy boomed in an unprecedented free-market environment, and the no-government situation has proven to be far better than the repressive government institutions and policies of Barre's era. However, the economic expansion is chaotic and there is a strong new demand for an accountable and effective government that could provide essential public goods for sustainable economic development.

AB The implementation of structural adjustment programs (SAPs) has often been undermined by opposition from politically powerful groups who are favored by existing policies. To assess the political sustainability of SAPs this paper uses social accounting matrices for three African countries to model the income effects of stylized SAPs on different socioeconomic groups. The analysis reveals wide variation in the likelihood for typical SAPs to be acceptable to political elites while generating growth in the rest of the economy. The presence of a rural elite or strong farm-nonfarm linkages can enhance the political sustainability of SAPs. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Sustainable neighbourhoods - a qualitative model for resource management
   in communities
SO LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING
LA English
DT Article
DE sustainability; neighbourhood; community
AB The need to improve the management of natural and societal resources in communities is becoming increasingly evident to urban planners in the Nordic countries. In this paper we propose a qualitative model that can help us understand the concept of sustainability from a neighbourhood perspective. Starting points in our analysis are five general conditions for survival characteristic to all living systems. Sustainability in human communities is further influenced by the individual's basic needs and preferences. We argue that the neighbourhood level is especially suited for a thorough discussion on sustainability in communities in general. We define six types of valuable resources that need to be managed properly to maintain sustainability and resilience in any community: natural, individual, social, historical, organisational and economic resources.

AB Valet and Meynadier (Valet, J.P., Meynadier, L., 1993) noted an intriguing sawtooth intensity pattern in sequences drilled during Leg 138 of the Ocean Drilling Program. The pattern is an almost linear decrease in intensity during stable polarity times followed by a rapid recovery or increase in intensity immediately after a reversal. They further noted an apparent correlation between the size of the intensity of the recovery and the length of the subsequent polarity chron and inferred that reversals are a consequence of a progressive degradation of the dipole field in that a strong dipole field inhibits a future reversal. This has significant potential implications for dynamo theory. However, their hypothesis implies that the nonstationarity in reversal rate during the Cenozoic is controlled by inhibition, and so their hypothesis is immediately testable using the available reversal chronology. Analysis of the chronology shows that the hypothesis is not sustainable. Crown copyright (C) 1997 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

AB A fundamental shift to a total system approach for crop protection is urgently needed to resolve escalating economic and environmental consequences of combating agricultural pests, Pest management strategies have long been dominated by quests for ''silver bullet'' products to control pest outbreaks, However, managing undesired variables in ecosystems is similar to that for other systems, including the human body and social orders, Experience in these fields substantiates the fact that therapeutic interventions into any system are effective only for short term relief because these externalities are soon ''neutralized'' by countermoves within the system, Long term resolutions can be achieved only by restructuring and managing these systems in ways that maximize the array of ''built-in'' preventive strengths, with therapeutic tactics serving strictly as backups to these natural regulators, To date, we have failed to incorporate this basic principle into the mainstream of pest management science and continue to regress into a foot race with nature, In this report, we establish why a total system approach is essential as the guiding premise of pest management and provide arguments as to how earlier attempts for change and current mainstream initiatives generally fail to follow this principle, We then draw on emerging knowledge about mul titrophic level interactions and other specific findings about management of ecosystems to propose a pivotal redirection of pest management strategies that would honor this principle and, thus, be sustainable. Finally, we discuss the potential immense benefits of such a central shift in pest management philosophy.

AB The subsistence agricultural systems of the Central Himalaya harbour a huge variety of traditional crops and cultivars. However, a recent survey conducted in 150 different villages located along an elevational transect of Alaknanda catchment of Central Himalaya reveals that over a period of two decades (1970-74 and 1990-94) the cultivated area under many traditional crops has declined precariously due to various reasons. Many crops are facing danger of complete extinction and consequently the ecological and economic security of the traditional farming systems of this region appears to be in jeopardy. Linking traditional crops with economic development of hill farmers through value addition adopting the traditional and modern appropriate technologies may be the suitable strategy to conserve these crops in-situ.

AB The long-term effects of cropping systems and management practices on soil properties provide essential information for assessing sustainability and environmental impact. Field experiments were undertaken in southern Spain to evaluate the long-term effects of tillage, crop rotation and nitrogen (N) fertilization on the organic matter (OM) and mineral nitrogen (N,,) contents of soil in a rain-fed Mediterranean agricultural system over a 6-year period. Tillage treatments included no tillage (NT) and conventional tillage (CT), crop rotations were of 2 yr with wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) (WS), wheat-chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) (WP), wheat-faba bean (Vicia faba L.) (WE), wheat-fallow (WF), and in addition, continuous wheat (CW). Nitrogen fertilizer rates were 50, 100, and 150 kg N ha(-1). A split-split plot design with four replications was used. Soil samples were collected from a depth of 90 cm at the beginning of the experiment and 6 yr later. Soil samples were also collected from a depth of 30 cm after 4 yr. These samples, Like those obtained at the beginning of the experiment, were subjected to comprehensive physico-chemical analyses. The soil samples that were collected 6 yr later were analyzed for OM, NH4+-N and NO3--N at the 0-30, 30-60 and 60-90 cm soil depths. The tillage method did not influence the OM or N-min contents of the soil, nor did legume rotations increase the OM content of soil relative to CW. A longer period may have been required for differences between treatments to be observed owing to the small amount of crop residue that is returned to soil under rain-fed conditions of semi-arid climates. The WF rotation did not raise the N-min content of the soil relative to the other rotations. The consistent significant interaction between tillage and crop rotation testifies to the differential effect of the management system on the Oh? content and N status of the soil. The ammonium levels clearly exceeded those of NO3--N throughout the soil profile. The high N-min content of the soils reveals the presence of abundant N resources that should be borne in mind in establishing N fertilization schemes for crops under highly variable climatic conditions including scant rainfall such as those of the Mediterranean region.

TI What has happened since 1991? Assessment of India's economic reforms
SO ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL WEEKLY
LA English
DT Article
AB This preliminary and partial assessment of India's orthodox reforms initiated in mid-1991 shows a mixed outcome so far: overcoming the liquidity crisis, the economy has broadly got back to the growth charted in 1980s, with a modest yet statistically significant slower growth of the secondary sector. The investment-GDP ratio has improved, however, with unfavourable compositional changes; social sector spending has been maintained as allocations for defence and economic services were cut. The fiscal correction has been mainly due to a reduction in public investment and expenditure. Industrial recovery is partial and uneven; and public sector output and profitability improved despite the policy shocks, though their sustainability seem suspect.

ID SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE; MANAGEMENT; SYSTEMS; DEFINITION; APPRAISAL
AB Different perspectives, related to different hierarchical levels of analysis, should be used when discussing technological changes in agriculture. In fact, technological choices are affected by: (i) the characteristics of the socioeconomic system to which the farming system belongs; (ii) the characteristics of the ecosystem managed for agricultural production; and (iii) the farmers' feelings and aspirations. This paper presents a model of biophysical analysis that can be used to establish bridges among different perspectives. The agricultural throughput per hour of labor and per hectare obtained at farm level is evaluated against two sets of indicators characterizing the constraints coming from societal and ecological sides. Economic growth pushes for increases in the intensity of the throughput 'per hour of labor' and 'per hectare' at the farm level (two indicators, namely socioeconomic and demographic pressure, are proposed to assess this effect). The need of maintaining ecological compatibility generates a contrasting pressure pushing for keeping as low as possible the intensity of throughput in the agroecosystem. A family of indicators (the ratios of 'current environmental loading (EL)'/'critical environmental loading (GEL)') is proposed to assess such a pressure. Feelings and aspirations of farmers determine the acceptability of compromises, at the moment of technological choices, after considering the severity of these two pressures. A plan 'productivity per hour' and 'productivity per hectare' can be used to study technological changes on two hierarchical levels (societal level and farming system level). A third axis can be added to this plane to include assessments of EL, Numerical examples are given for a sample of more than 60 world countries. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB This paper is aimed at assessing the comparative importance bf constraints in land and labour endowment for energy balance in agriculture, when assessed at the level of national crop production systems. The relation between output/input energy ratio of agriculture (output: food energy in crops; input: commercial energy embodied in technical inputs), average labour productivity (food energy (in Joules) produced per hour of labour allocated to agriculture) and land productivity (food energy (in J) produced per hectare of cropped land) has been studied on a 75-country sample using a cluster analysis procedure. A cross-section equation has been developed, explaining output/input ratio in terms of intensity of land and labour-food-energy throughputs. The results suggest that land constraints, with respect to the total population size, rather than labour constraints, tend to be associated with comparatively higher energy requirements in agricultural production. Therefore, the 'emancipation' of agricultural production from land shortages implies two 'biophysical costs.' That is, for the production of the same amount of food, a consistent increase in demographic density implies both a larger consumption of fossil energy input and a larger environmental impact.

AB Populations of vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal (VAM) fungi and mycorrhiza formation were examined in a field experiment studying the agricultural application of composted animal manures, The replicate experiment allowed each crop of a Zea mays > vegetable > small grain rotation to be sampled each of 3 years, Chicken litter/leaf compost and dairy cow manure/leaf compost enhanced spore populations of two VAM fungus species type groups (Glomus etunicatum type and the general Glomus spp. group, including G. mosseae) relative to those found in plots treated with raw dairy cow manure and conventional fertilizer, Populations of other groups were not affected by amendment, due likely to the large amount of P added in composts and manure relative to the conventional fertilizer applied, Crop rotation point had consistent, significant effects, with both lower populations of spores and less mycorrhizal infectivity of soil in plots after the vegetable crop (Spinacea oleraceae and/or Capsicum annuum) relative to maize and small grain (Avena sativa or Triticum aestivum). This was due to the non-mycorrhizal status and very low mycorrhization (approximately 1% root length colonized) of S. oleraceae and C. annuum, respectively, Future agricultural applications of compost and manure to provide N for crops need to consider the effects upon VAM fungi of other nutrients in these amendments.

TI Pasture performance and sustainability in the Peruvian Amazon: Results
   of long-term on-farm research
SO AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
LA English

ID MANAGEMENT; CATTLE; SYSTEM; BASIN
AB Over the past decade there have been significant shifts in both the theory and methods of agricultural development. One of the most significant theoretical shifts has been the explicit incorporation of ecological criteria in agricultural research under the rubric of Sustainability'. Methodologically there has been widespread acceptance of farmer participatory research strategies or 'on-farm research.' This paper reports on the results of on-farm research with livestock carried out in the Peruvian Amazon from 1987-1992. The project was designed with several goals including (a) improving our understanding of farming systems in the region, (b) testing the agronomic potential of improved forages under on-farm conditions, (c) measuring the effects of improved forages on animal production and (d) assessing the ecological effects of cattle raising in the humid tropics. The paper presents results of the on-farm research, including information on pasture establishment, persistence, productivity and sustainability of grazing practices in this ecosystem. These results highlight the contribution of on-farm research to improving the productivity and sustainability of pastures in the humid tropics. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Agricultural production around the Baltic Sea is at present not sustainable in the long-term perspective. The location and structure of livestock production, in combination with poor management of agricultural waste constitute the most severe environmental problems. New technology within the fields of manure engineering and site-specific crop management with the use of GPS creates new possibilities to handle animal waste in a resource efficient and environmentally friendly way. Economic analysis also indicates that investments in new environmentally friendly techniques are profitable.

AB Pollution by nutrients and pesticides from agriculture causes many problems in the marine environment. One of the main sources of the problem is agricultural activities. Comprehensive work has been going on for a long time within HELCOM (Helsinki commission) and the catchment area of the Baltic Sea, but the progress in reduction of pollution from these sources has been slow. There is a need for consorted action at the international level to achieve the overall long-term objective of sustainable agriculture. The Heads of Governments decided at the Baltic Sea States Summit in 1996, inter alia, to elaborate an Annex on Agriculture to the Helsinki Convention. HELCOM reacted immediately on that wish and established a joint PITF/TC Project on Agriculture to prepare the Annex and Codes on Good Agricultural Practice. The Annex to the Helsinki Convention should be adopted by the Environmental Ministers at HELCOM 19 in March 1998. The implementation of the Annex and the Codes of Good agricultural Practice are expected to achieve a clear reduction of pollution load from agricultural sources consistent with the target of a sound ecological balance in the Baltic Sea and of sustainable agriculture.

AB A large, densely populated catchment area dominating water quality of land runoff, stratification of the brackish water, a residence time of 25 years, intermittent renewal of oxygenated bottom water from the North Sea, few plant and animal species already stressed by low salinity, make the Baltic Sea vulnerable to changes in external forcings such as increased inputs of nutrients and toxic substances. A severalfold increase of nutrient inputs and primary production since the beginning of the century has increased the area of anoxic bottoms, decreased the transparency of the water by 2.5-3 m, favored filamentous annual algae at the expense of coarse, perennial ones-like the important bladderwrack (Fucus vesiculosus)-changed the fish community from cod, salmon, pike and perch toward herring, sprat, bream, and roach. Because they are a major source of external nitrogen, a shift in current agricultural practices has to be made including: tree curtains to increase patchiness, biodiversity and natural pest control; catch crops along rivers; matching animal density and crop types to achieve optimal recycling of nutrients. So far, integrated land use, based on operative ecological-socioeconomic models, is the most powerful policy instrument for a sustainable agriculture.

AB An overview of natural conditions and socioeconomic factors of the contemporary development of agriculture in the Baltic region of Russia is presented. Special attention is paid to the critical situation in agriculture and its economic, demographic and ecological consequences. Because of different circumstances and specific priorities in the regional policy of the Federal Government, rural areas in the Baltic region have suffered a drastic decline in population and agricultural production. In spite of the removal of former agricultural lands from usage, spontaneous ecodevelopment in the region can not be considered as only positive. Optimization of land use with a precise indication of the geographical address for the policy recommendations is needed for the development of agriculture. Recommendations and concrete project proposals are proposed based on the territorial differences in the current types of agriculture.

AB This paper analyzes the transition period for Latvia's economic system from 1990 to date. The character of the factors that affect the situation in rural areas and those that influence employment are: the decline of agricultural production; unemployment; loss of the market in the East; and decline in the standard of material well-being of the population. Analyses of the influence of agriculture on environment include: the dynamics of areas treated with pesticides and mineral fertilizers; eutrophication of water basins in Latvia; soil quality; and pollution of artesian waters. The paper also presents an indication of the first steps being taken toward sustainable agriculture in Latvia.

AB During the Lithuanian economic crisis of the 1990s, a decline in agricultural production was accompanied by decreases in water and environmental pollution. If no efforts are made for the reconstruction of agriculture toward sustainable and biological farming, the ongoing recovery of the economy will in all likelihood result in increases in the levels of pollution. For that reason an important state pilot program was developed and the Tatula Fund (Karst Region Fund Tatula) was established to implement it. The program and the fund are designed to support and encourage the transition from traditional to sustainable and biological agriculture. The Tatula Fund allocates its members free interest credits and grants, and subsidies for the construction of waste treatment facilities, for educational activities, ecological monitoring and other activities, on a competitive basis. In the ecologically sensitive karst region of northern Lithuania, it is necessary to protect groundwater, while at the same time it is important to solve the current marketing problems of agricultural production as well as unemployment issues. According to the statement of the government's strategies on environmental protection and climate changes, as the national economy continues to grow, the pilot program developed in the karst region will be expanded throughout Lithuania. So far, the programs that have been developed for the karst zone, on education and certification of biological production, are being implemented in all regions of Lithuania.

Previous activities deal with Baltic Sea protection, national action programs and economic instruments. The objectives and structure of the Finnish Agri-Environmental Programme 1995-1999 are explained, and the implementation of the program is viewed through environmental goals and environmental impacts. Transition to sustainable agriculture in Finland is also discussed, followed by an assessment of sustainability and environmental risk analyses. A proposal to launch an international scientific project to establish a common standardized system for assessing the present and future sustainability of agriculture for Baltic Sea Region is presented.

AB This paper deals with the question of whether the main changes currently taking place in German agriculture are compatible with the requirements of economic, social, environmental and political sustainability. The first issues discussed are structural adjustment processes and income problems in West German agriculture. This leads to the conclusion that the social hardships farm families have to cope with, economic disruptions caused by policy changes, and serious ecological problems resulting from agricultural practices are obviously not in accordance with the criteria of sustainable development. The second issue the paper addresses is transformation of East German agriculture focusing on two main areas of change: restructuring of collectivized farms and privatization of nationalized land. The institutional arrangements and organizational forms of agriculture resulting from these developments are not likely to be always sustainable in the long run, because of the huge economic transaction costs of the transformation process itself and the political rent seeking activities it provokes with the interest groups and political networks involved. Present and coming changes of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) are the third subject of the paper, particularly referring to the present discussion on a "reform of the CAP reform". Also this area faces serious sustainability problems. The subsidies paid per ha or livestock unit cause considerable allocative distortions reducing economic efficiency. They can also only be justified as temporary support measures facilitating adjustment processes induced by price reductions. Furthermore, only a very small proportion of the financial means spent for the reform measures are used for environmental programs. Finally, the ecological situation in German agriculture is outlined by indicating some crucial issues.

AB Since 1950, Danish agriculture has increased its production, and has become very specialized and highly and consistenly productive both per unit area and per unit resource. The negative effects of agriculture are starting to weigh too heavily on the environment, e.g. fertilizer residues in water, pesticides in food and water, and resource use. In order to reduce the loss of nutrients and change the landscape to facilitate higher biodiversity, several national programs have been set up between 1980 and 1990. In 1987, the first Danish law to introduce organic farming was approved. Sustainable development has two sides, the well-being of human society, and that of the natural environment. A third component explicitly includes succeeding generations. We conclude that the intentions of sustainable development are more easily formulated than the means by which they can be achieved. Our final conclusion is that radical change of direction in Danish agriculture is not apparent at present nor is such a change likely to happen quickly, even if desired, because of social and economic resistances.

AB Swedish institutes and organizations established agricultural research and development projects in the Baltic Sea region already in 1991. Activities have mainly been performed by the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU), the Federation of Swedish Farmers (LRF), the Swedish Institute of Agricultural Engineering (JTI), and Agricultural Societies in Sweden. The main financiers have been BITS, Sida and the Swedish Institute. In research cooperation, NOVABA has played an important role. NOVABA is the organization for cooperation between the Nordic and Baltic agricultural universities in the above mentioned sector. Experience has shown that all projects must have a comprehensive view. Economic, environmental, social and cultural aspects must be observed simultaneously. The goals and ambitions for the environmental sector will probably fail if they are not followed-up by economic development. The major economic problem to be solved in the Baltic republics, Russia and Poland is how to stimulate privately owned farms, in order to attain sustainable agriculture. In this process local mobilization, business planning, local cooperation, and production combinations are key concepts.

AB In this paper the challenges of agricultural transition towards sustainability in the western countries of the Baltic region are outlined. The focus will be on four driving forces that will determine the future in the West as well as in the East with regard to the development of more sustainable agricultural production patterns: the market and public opinion, environmental legislation and its implementation, economic instruments and development of farmer skills or "good agricultural practices".

AB Assuming a declining correlation in yields as distance between pairs of orchards increases, yield variability in peach production may be reduced by increasing distances among orchards. As a measure of yield variability that avoids possible bias resulting from orchard-specific effects, a stochastic production function is estimated. Results support the assumption that a declining correlation between yields exists as distance increases. For every mile further apart, the correlation in yield declines 2.28%.

AB Introduction: This is a preliminary report from a research collaboration between Asian Health Services (community health center); Koreans in Alameda County, California; and the University of California at Berkeley School of Public Health. This five-year Centers for Disease Control and Prevention project supports a collaborative community intervention to improve breast and cervical cancer screening behavior among Korean women.
   Methods: A Korean Community Advisory Board and Korean-American staff were recruited, and community sensitive research (CSR) and participatory action research (PAR) principles were applied: (1) building community infrastructure for sustainable action, (2) cultural appropriateness, (3) assuring responsiveness to community needs, and (4) a prevention focus that would assist health care providers. We conducted a population-based telephone survey on 676 Korean adults (272 men and 404 women).
   Results: The collaborative process yielded (1) a high response rate (79%), (2) baseline health information on Korean Americans, (3) broadening of the original research topic, (4) survey responses that will guide intervention design, (5) culturally competent strategies, and (6) expanded Korean-American Community capacity for local action.
   Conclusions: Research collaboration between universities, community-based organizations, and ethnic communities can yield high-quality research. CSR and PAR approaches help break through cultural barriers in otherwise "hard to reach" API subpopulations. Determinants of success include sharing common goals; trust, honesty, and integrity; shared decision making; mutual respect of each partner's expertise; cultural sensitivity and cultural competence; flexibility, good communication, and mutual learning; and continuity of partners. Actively engaging members of the study population in the research process builds community capacity, thus laying the foundation for future projects that improve health status.

AB The interactive effect of phosphate-solubilizing bacteria and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi on plant use of soil P sources of low bioavailability (endogenous or added as rock phosphate [RP] material) was evaluated by using soil microcosms which integrated P-32 isotopic dilution techniques. The microbial inocula consisted of the AM fungus Glomus intraradices and two phosphate-solubilizing rhizobacterial isolates: Enterobacter sp, and Bacillus subtilis, These rhizobacteria behaved as ''mycorrhiza helper bacteria'' promoting establishment of both the indigenous and the introduced AM endophytes despite a gradual decrease in bacterial population size, which dropped from 10(7) at planting to 10(3) CFU g(-1) of dry rhizosphere soil at harvest. Dual inoculation with G. intraradices and B. subtilis significantly increased biomass and N and P accumulation in plant tissues. Regardless of the rhizobacterium strain and of the addition of RP, AM: plants displayed lower specific activity (P-32/P-31) than their comparable controls, suggesting that the plants used P sources not available in their absence, The inoculated rhizobacteria may have released phosphate ions (P-31), either from the added RP or from the less-available indigenous P sources, which were effectively taken up by the external AM mycelium, Soluble Ca deficiency in the test soil may have benefited P solubilization. At least 75% of the P in dually inoculated plants derived from the added RP, It appears that these mycorrhizosphere interactions between bacterial and fungal plant associates contributed to the biogeochemical P cycling, thus promoting a sustainable nutrient supply to plants.

AB Lack of evidence that sponge aquaculture can produce sustainable supply of target metabolite for industrial or pharmaceutical use is constraining commercial development. Experiments to determine aquaculture feasibility examined the influence of environmental factors and explant characteristics on the growth and survivorship of three morphologically distinct sponge species - Psammocinia hawere, a massive cup-shape fibrous sponge, Raspailia agminata, a thickly encrusting siliceous sponge and Raspailia topsenti, a branching digitate siliceous sponge. A variety of explant types were cultured at different exposures, depths and seasons. P-hawere explants transplanted to deeper water in winter demonstrated highest growth and survivorship. This was attributed to a relatively lower intensity of UV radiation and cooler water temperatures which promoted fast pinacoderm healing. Growth and survivorship increased with increasing explant size and with proportion of intact pinacoderm. R-agiminata explants demonstrated the highest growth rates, perhaps a function of the encrusting and flexible morphology. Highest growth and survivorship were obtained in sheltered locations. Within each species, ratio of body size to wound size and overall size of the wounds inflicted, would greatly influence survival, but with respect to temperate rocky reef sponges, this study suggests that encrusting and amorphous sponges have the greatest potential for success in aquaculture.

AB German society is in a crisis characterized by five criteria: the German unification process, globalization, social achievements, a crisis of meaning and of leadership. Five problems must be solved if the crisis is to be overcome: A new attitude to work and to technology must be found. After reunification, there is need for thorough renewal. The democratic system must give answers to the essential questions of social life and life in a community. A new leading elite with imagination, initiative, and responsibility for the 21st century must be found. What is needed, in a way, is the ethical equivalent of war and defeat. The present crisis should be the cause, and the reason, for seizing and opportunity it includes.

AB When the Maputaland Marine Reserve was proclaimed in 1986, conservation authorities held divergent opinions on whether traditional subsistence harvesting of the intertidal resources should be allowed to continue. A monitoring programme was therefore instituted, with the assistance of the local community, to quantify the intertidal harvest as a first step to assessing its sustainability. Catch and effort data for ghost crabs Ocypode spp. and mole crabs Emerita austroafricana and Hippa ovalis over a 7-year period are discussed here. Total (day and night) harvests declined from 146000 ghost crabs and 129000 mole crabs in 1989 to 86000 ghost crabs and 80000 mole crabs in 1993. However, effort also declined and the mean annual catch per unit effort for night catches, which comprised 89% of the total catch, changed little, averaging 28.3 ghost crabs and 24.5 mole crabs per harvester per night. About 8% of the ghost crab harvest is sold, generating an annual income of R1700. There ape no indications that harvesting of ghost crabs and mole crabs is unsustainable, and harvesting effort appears to be decreasing. No change in management is recommended.

AB A beneficial reform may be blocked by a majority if it is implemented by a big bang, but the same reform may succeed with an optimally designed gradualist approach, A gradualist approach tan sometimes split opposition force and is, in this sense, more politically sustainable. On the other hand, if both approaches are politically preferred to no reform, a big bang is often preferred to gradualism in terms of both political support as well as economic efficiency.

ID EFFECTIVE POPULATION-SIZE; FISHERIES MANAGEMENT; COHO SALMON; SELECTION
AB The short-term dynamics of salmonid populations are directly related to the mean sizes of individual families. The amount of genetic variation maintained in the population is directly related to the: variance in sizes of individual families. Both the mean and variance of individual family sizes have important implications for conservation actions and sustainable levels of harvest of salmonid fishes. We develop a context for examining variation in family size. and we provide estimates of mean and variance of family size from five groups of marked pink salmon (Oncohynchus gorbuscha) released into the north Pacific Ocean. We then present two important results: (1) a statistically detectable genetic component of marine survival exists in groups with high marine survival and (2) ratios of variance-to-mean family size are linearly related to mean family size over the interval that we observed. These results imply that short-term population increases come from a small fraction of the population's families, that salmon encounter a fluctuating marine environment, and that the most favored phenotype changes from generation to generation. These results also support the widely held view that protecting genetic variation in recovering or exploited salmon populations has important economic benefits.

AB We examined the influence of management on soil organic matter (SOM) dynamics and yield of wheat grain in semiarid Chernozemic and humid Gray Luvisolic soils. The Century model was tested with data obtained from long-term research plots cropped to wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) monoculture and cereal-hay (CH). Century simulated changes in soil organic-C (DC) and organic-N (ON) within 10% of actual measurements taken over decades. Our analysis indicated that management and soil erosion affected the rime required for SOM to achieve new steady-state level (T-st). T-st ranged between 12 yr under wheat and 46 yr under CH cropping. Increasing the SOM content of degraded soils to new steady-state level appears to increase grain yield between 86 kg ha(-1) and 840 kg ha(-1).
   Wheat-fallow (WF) rotation plots receiving <10 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), and with erosion >13.6 t ha(-1) yr(-1) degraded SOM. The average long-term yield of wheat grain (including new high yielding varieties) was maintained at < 910 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) under degraded SOM content. Well-fertilized continuous wheat (CW) and CH rotation plots with erosion <4 t ha(-1) yr(-1) aggraded SOM content, and maintained the long-term average grain yield at >1290 kg ha(-1) yr(-1). Sustained OC levels were attained by returning 1030 kg C ha(-1) yr(-1) as plant residue (roots + aboveground) and keeping soil erosion less than or equal to 12.8 t ha(-1) yr(-1). Sustainable crop production systems need to consider SOM dynamics and erosion as factors limiting grain yield even after introducing genetically improved wheat varieties.

DT Article
AB We are taking part in an intense change in industry and social environment. Today's industrial and business network is rapidly expanding to global dimension. Workplace, production, product shipment and business process is under rapid change and global adaptation. The ongoing setting of direction noticeably includes the scope of regulatory requirements. It's clearly evident: the safe handling of hazardous chemicals is given sustainable priority, from local to global scale. The broad commitment to safety- and health-related information (to safety data sheet, label, classification of substances and mixtures, risk assessment, waste handling), from a multilanguage perspective, reflects the concern for a safe operation in the broadest sense (safe workplace, health protection, profduct stewardship). There is a shift in mind-set. Emphasis is on wide-scale conceptual solution, cost-effective, rapidly doable, tuned for integration and adaptability to change ('less complex', 'dynamic', adaptable to the business requirements). Modern hardware-, software-, and communication technologies allow having the safety information for hazardous products available, through today's communication network, wherever needed, for the benefit of the producer and user. The following article is written from a practical viewpoint and with the scope of a large international company. The content describes the development and implementation of information systems relating to safety data sheets, product labels, classification (expert system), in review over the recent years. The focus is on various perspectives, i.e. workprocess, information technology, value creation (productivity gain and competitive edge).

AB This paper presents a case study for optimizing water management at Gregg River Coal Mine located near Hinton, Alberta. The optimization study was derived based on a review and assessment of existing management practices and plans for future operation and final reclamation. A proactive water management strategy was developed to assist mine staff in adopting a rational, environmentally sound and economical approach to water management. A plan was developed to provide for safe operation, self-sustaining operation, law maintenance, minimum negative environmental impacts, and anticipation of future needs for existing and future operations. A plan for final reclamation drainage was developed including establishment of effective, sustainable, and maintenance-free water management systems, The study demonstrated the importance and benefits of a proactive approach for integrated mine water management. This approach is recommended for other similar mine operations because it will improve environmental compliance and reduce costs of water management.

AB The Chronic Illness Management Research and Development Project (CIMRDP) was created as part of an effort to implement clinical process improvements in HealthSystems Minnesota, a vertically integrated care system in Minneapolis. CIMRDP's objective is to introduce sustainable improvements in the management of chronic illness. These types of quality improvement efforts require fundamental change at the organizational level, which often does not occur, and the programs do not continue beyond the initial stage. Using CIMRDP as a model for a sustainable chronic illness management program, this paper explores the process of implementing clinical guidelines for the management of chronic illness and contending with the complex problem of initiating change at an organizational level. It reviews factors critical to the success of such a program, including the use of focus groups to ensure a patient-centered approach, the advantage of hiring an outside consultant, the question of whether to accept external funding, and an evaluation outline of the six main tasks the program requires. Methods for marketing and integration are also presented.

DE biomass carbon storage; biofuel; forestry; sequestration; land use
AB A simulation model is employed to study the potential for greenhouse gas mitigation of biomass carbon storage in both long rotation forestry 'sequestration' and indirectly, through biofuel production. The model simulates competition in the allocation of a global fixed supply of nonforest, non-barren land to wilderness (yielding biodiversity benefits) and to use in conventional farming, in medium-term sequestration forestry (as a carbon buffer stock) and in biofuel production. A set of non-linear ordinary differential equations is solved simultaneously to yield time profiles for land rent, fossil fuel producer prices, carbon fuel selling prices and for the carbon level in the atmosphere. Rent rises in a non-linear manner as the land constraint is approached. A carbon tax provides a wedge between fossil fuel prices and consumer prices, with its revenue dedicated to covering the costs of biofuel production and of the buffer stock. The carbon flow effects of absorption by forestry and biofuel production and of emissions from using fuel, together with the effects of natural absorption, combine to yield a time profile of atmospheric carbon. The model is driven by user selection of policy choices in the time profiles of land use for sequestration and for biofuel. Reductions of carbon levels towards preindustrial levels by the year 2050 appear to be feasible under sufficiently vigorous policy. Matlab software is employed and the full model coding is available from the author. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

DE well-being; sustainability; sustainable development; ecological
   economics; social limits
AB Ecological economics seeks to recognize what traditional economics often ignores; that the economy is embedded in wider social and biophysical systems. To date ecological economics has focused on the biophysical dimensions of these interactions. Yet achieving sustainable development will require difficult decisions regarding which environmental and other assets should be preserved, and in what form. This emphasizes the importance of understanding why particular environmental resources and services are important to human well-being, and how social and economic institutions may be structured to make the best use of these and other forms of capital. The paper thus examines a variety of approaches to well-being, characterizing these as interpreting well-being as a state of mind, as a state of the world, as human capability, or as the satisfaction of underlying needs. The literature surveyed is drawn largely from political philosophy and psychology, and includes classical utilitarianism and self-evaluative approaches, descriptive utilitarianism and preference-based approaches, the basic needs approach, functional approaches, and underlying needs-based and virtue-based approaches. Particular authors include Michalos, Scitovsky, Easterlin, Hirsch, Galbraith, Rawls, Sen, Maslow, Boyden and Max-Neef. The ideas examined are found to have significant implications for economic theory and policy, especially regarding the social construction of preferences, the treatment of distributional issues, the identification of universal underlying needs, and the relationship between the satisfaction of these needs and perceived well-being. These insights suggest that rising real incomes are unlikely to result in improved community well-being, calling into question the traditional economic view of progress. They also offer a new path to sustainable development, in which the primary focus is on the cultivation of appropriate institutions and attitudes, rather than on the better management of resources. The paper concludes that important aspects of social, economic and environmental systems are codetermined, and thus that achieving sustainable development will require an expansion of the scope of analysis to encompass a wider system dynamic. The most promising approaches to well-being in this context are those that identify universal underlying human needs, thus avoiding the commodity fetishism of mainstream economics.

ID MANAGEMENT
AB Hypotheses about the relative productivities and impacts of current and officially recommended stocking rates were tested in a case study in southern Africa. They support the view that biased measurements of livestock productivity and inappropriate measurements of rangeland degradation can lead to under-estimates of the productivity of African communal rangelands, overestimates of the urgency of de-stocking, and misunderstanding of the strengths of measures required to effect it. By including the full range of livestock products in estimates of productivity and calculating output per unit of land area rather than per unit of livestock, more accurate estimates of productivity can be made. Estimates of degradation based on irreversible changes enable discrimination between trivial and important impacts of grazing. Modelling suggests de-stocking is not in general worthwhile at present in eastern Botswana. It may be necessary to regulate numbers of animals in the future. If livestock densities increase, grass cover could fall below the critical level and rates of degradation increase suddenly and rapidly. Adverse climatic change could reduce herbaceous productivity with the same effect. The approach used here should help decision making in those circumstances. Choosing an appropriate stocking rate should be an ethical decision requiring negotiations among stakeholders. Practitioners should recognise that it is socially, not technically determined and that it is but one level among many possible densities. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Socio-ecological economics has emerged as a new movement within ecological economics that overtly takes account of the sociological and political bases of economic activity as well as the biophysical base. The paper comments on the usefulness of the principles of socio-ecological economics in the light of a recent example of applied social and economic research into contingent valuation (CV) and integrated catchment management (ICM) in the Hawkesbury-Nepean. In the first Australian study of the temporal stability of CV responses, it was found that average willingness to pay (WTP) to improve water quality did not change significantly over a 2-year period, nor could any statistically significant explanation of bid size or change in WTP be found. On each of the three occasions when CV surveys were completed, participants were asked a series of follow-up questions and then engaged in discussion on attitudes to CV: reasons for any changes in WTP and views of possible uses for CV in ICM.
   Socio-ecological economics proved to be useful in analysing the results of the case study by identifying a wider range of possible determinants of individual and government behaviour than simple maximisation models. These determinants, especially ethical values for individuals and organisational culture for governments provided good explanations for the qualitative results obtained, and perhaps a better explanation of the quantitative results. It also usefully emphasised the dynamics of the interaction between the different determinants of behaviour with regard to CV. Consideration of the likely dynamic between the different organisational structures and cultures within ICM raised the possibility that introducing CV into ICM in a widespread fashion could lead to resistance and modification of its use to a more qualitative and educative role.
   The ideas of socio-ecological economics have made a valuable contribution to the understanding and analysis of this case study and provide the beginning of a research agenda for socially-oriented ecological economists. Results of the case study suggest that this agenda should include the applications of learning theory and social ecology to policy-making institutions and processes for moving towards sustainability.

AB Australian farmers are searching for reliable, easily measured indicators of soil health to monitor sustainability of their enterprises. Over the past 5 years earthworms have been promoted as indicators of soil health by some researchers. Others have been reluctant to accept soil macrofauna in general as soil health indicators. Their reluctance is based on the difficulty of interpreting biological data in relation to soil health as there is no clear understanding of the links between soil macrofauna and soil health. The problem is further compounded by the inherent difficulty in studying soil biota, inadequate experimental design, and the lack of long-term commitment to funding such studies. This paper reflects on current research, and maps out conditions and directions for future research if the role of soil macrofauna in soil health is to be better understood. The compilation of adequate baseline data, the appropriate delineation of experimental plots, attention to the totality of environmental conditions including land management practices, the consideration of impact by macrofauna other than earthworms, are some of the directions are outlined. The challenge in the future will be to shift the emphasis of soil macrofauna research towards understanding their function in soil processes essential to ecosystem functioning. Without this sort of experimental evidence scientists cannot indicate to the farmer whether the soil resource is declining in quality, is stable or in a process of renewal based on the presence or absence of certain macrofauna.

AB About 50% of the primary energy supply in The Netherlands is used for heat production. To achieve a sustainable heat-supply system, it is necessary to obtain insight into costs, efficiency and environmental impacts for existing and possible future technologies. We have performed a comparative system analysis on six possible heat-supply chains (distribution and conversion) providing low-temperature heat to households to obtain a clear picture of their likely long-term economic, energetic and environmental performance to the year 2030. The systems studied are based on natural gas distribution [local condensing boilers or micro-cogeneration (indoors)] and on electricity (heat-pumps) and heat-distribution (district heat and small-scale cogeneration). A systems analysis was used. A heat-supply system based on district heating and/or electricity distribution turns out to be a good alternative to the present gas-based system. In addition, introduction of these systems will facilitate the future sustainability of energy sources. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

DE clean coal technology; combustion; gasification; handling; liquefaction
AB Coal provided 16.1% (116.3 million tons) of the energy for Japan in FY 1992. According to the long-term energy supply and demand outlook in Japan, prepared and revised in June 1994 by the Advisory Committee for Energy, it is estimated that coal will provide 16.4% (130 million tons) of the energy in 2000 and 15.4% (134 million tons) in 2010, and that coal demand will increase. Japan imports one-third of the amount of international coal trade and depends heavily on overseas coals. In FY 1993, Japan imported 112 million tons of overseas coals and depended on foreign countries for about 94% of coal used. Coal provides about 30% of the energy for the world. Owing to the stable supply of coal and its economic efficiency for the middle and long term, technologies for coal utilization such as clean coal conversion, including liquefaction, gasification, etc., and efficient combustion processes are being developed in Japan as the chief substitute for petroleum to reduce the excessive dependence on petroleum. Clean coal technologies being developed in Japan will spread widely throughout the world and are expected to create sustainable growth while solving energy and environmental issues.

AB In recent years the two-tier model of metropolitan government has declined in importance as metropolitan authorities have been circumscribed, weakened, or abolished. At the same time, however, new urban patterns and changing political and economic circumstances are creating needs that point to the continued validity of the two-tier model. In particular, economic pressures resulting from global competition, and societal pressures associated with the need for sustainable development, are providing a basis for new responsibilities and new expectations with regard to metropolitan governance, and there continues to be a case for two scales of response. A major point of difference from the past is that the metropolitan scale is now much larger in spatial terms, and as a result it is useful to consider the upper tier in terms of regional or mesolevel government, and the concept of city-region, adapted to present-day circumstances, may provide a useful framework for future development. Recent proposals for Toronto are illustrative of the changing needs with regard to metropolitan government.

AB Chemical safety is concerned with the assessment of human health (and environmental) risks and their management. The safety of chemicals in food, present as normal constituents, intentional additives, contaminants or residues is part of chemical safety. Morbidity and mortality due to allergenic chemicals and allergic hypersensitization are being addressed on a global basis. As part of this, international efforts are being made to establish the prevalence of respiratory and dermal allergies in all countries and it is timely to extend this to food allergies. A number of international organizations are involved in the assessment of chemical risk and risk management. Information exchange is a vital part of these processes. The International Programme on Chemical Safety is an example of a cooperative programme of three organizations with close links and coordination with other bodies and organizations concerned with safe and sustainable use of chemicals.

AB Since the concept of sustainable development has found a broad echo in public and political issues, the need for measures that are highly sensitive to sustainable qualities has arisen. As the dissemination of the sustainability concept unfolded, different indicators claimed to show the right direction for our common future. This paper focuses on flow based measures for eco-sustainability. The life cycle analysis (LCA) combined with a valuation via limit threshold values, the material input per unit service (MIPS), the sustainable process index (SPI), the appropriated carrying capacity (ACC), an abatement cost based approach (PCC) and a concept based on the second law of thermodynamics (entropy) are reviewed and discussed. The application of eco-sustainability measures requires an understanding of the basic ideas (ideology) behind the concepts. Each measure is designed for a special field of application and to achieve a special aim. Therefore, valuations do not necessarily point in the same direction when different indices are used. The application of different measures to numerous case studies shows that results strongly depend on the basic assumptions. None of the described measures singly represents all the important attributes of ecological accounting. However, SPI shows the most important abilities and a big ranking potential: recycling problems and the general problems of accounting for sustainable qualities are solved to a large extent.

AB Objectives: Link traditional agricultural production disciplines to the food sciences and the various disciplines concerned with human nutrition and health in order to find sustainable solutions to malnutrition.
   Design: Develop a new integrated program area within a university by forging explicit linkages within a wide array of disciplines concerned with food systems and human health.
   Setting: The College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, the College of Human Ecology, the Division of Nutrition, and the Cornell international Institute for Food, Agriculture, and Development at Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, USA.
   Interventions: Use food-based, system approaches to meet human nutrition goals. Current focus is on the provision of micronutrients (especially iron, vitamin A and iodine) for people globally.
   Results: A new program area 'Food Systems for Health' has been developed at Cornell University. The program fosters effective interdisciplinary research, teaching and extension activities directed towards sustainable improvements in human nutrition and health.
   Conclusions: The old paradigms of agriculture, human nutrition, and public health must be shifted from current linear approaches to integrated and interactive approaches if effective long-term, food-based solutions to micronutrient malnutrition are to be found.

AB Objectives: To stimulate novel sustainable solutions to the problem of the nutritional iron deficiency, we asked: How does Nature insure proper iron nutrition of embryos and neonatal animals? Estimates of iron deficiency world-wide are 30% of the population, with women and children at the greatest risk. Recent studies linking iron deficiency with impeded cognitive development emphasizes the enormity of the impact of iron deficiency. Sustainable solutions to the problem of dietary iron deficiency have been elusive.
   Results: Data for storage iron was examined in seeds, developing plants, embryos and developing animals. In all cases, the common source of stored iron for development was ferritin. The protein component of ferritin concentrates iron billions of times above the solubility of the free metal ion. High conservation of ferritin sequences in bacteria, plants and animals and the specificity of ferritin bioavailability either added extrinsically or intrinsically enriched in a selected soybean cultivar, showed high efficacy in curing dietary iron deficiency in the rat model. Older data on ferritin were reevaluated in light of contemporary knowledge.
   Conclusions: Enhancement of natural seed ferritin content by biotechnology and breeding has the potential for a sustainable solution to the problem of global dietary iron deficiency.

AB Objectives: Review how agricultural systems might be changed to increase the vitamin A density of diets in developing countries to provide sustainable solutions to vitamin A deficiency globally.
   Design: Develop agricultural systems that not only assure calorie adequacy for people, but also address vitamin A density in diets.
   Settings: Agricultural systems could be modified in some developing nations in ways that would provide adequate dietary amounts of pro-vitamin A carotenoids from plant food sources.
   Subjects: Infants and children of low-income families are most at risk of developing vitamin A deficiency in developing countries.
   Interventions: Cropping systems could be modified to include more vegetable and fruit crops containing higher bioavailable amounts of provitamin A carotenoids in some countries. Additionally, cultural practices could be modified through education, agricultural extension and/or social marketing to insure that the bioavailable provitamin A carotenoid levels in food crops are optimized. Staple food crops could be improved as sources of provitamin A carotenoids by traditional plant breeding and/or by genetic engineering efforts.
   Results: Currently, many techniques are available to increase the vitamin A content of diets through sustainable food-based approaches. Agricultural approaches should be examined closely to finding sustainable food-based system solutions to vitamin A deficiency globally.
   Conclusions: The world community should strive to find food-based system approaches to eliminating vitamin A deficiency. Modifying agricultural systems in ways that will not only maximizing food production, but also insure nutritional adequacy of vitamin A is a desirable goal for many developing countries.

TI Abundance, growth, and production of the sea scallop Argopecten
   purpuratus (Lamarck 1819): bases for sustainable exploitation of natural
   scallop beds in north-central Chile
SO FISHERIES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
DE Agropecten purpuratus; Chilean scallop; shellfish production
ID RECRUITMENT LIMITATION
AB The Chilean scallop (Argopecten purpuratus) fishery has been closed for many years, but natural scallop beds are still in jeopardy because illegal harvesting continues. Overexploitation has resulted in decreased productivity, which in many areas of Chile has caused the decline or complete elimination of natural scallop populations. Moreover, illegal harvesting is of particular concern as it threatens efforts to establish self-sustaining scallop beds along Chile's northern coastline.
   This paper reports on the status of the scallop bed in Puerto Aldea, located in Tongoy Bay, Chile, which was responsible for 97.5% of Chile's scallops produced in cultures in 1991. Mean scallop densities in this area were calculated to be as low as 1.64 ind m(-2). Growth rates (estimated using ELEFAN) were faster than previously estimated, with scallops taking 18 months to reach commercial size (> 90 mm). Growth parameters were Loo = 125 mm and K = 0.84. The P/B ratio was calculated at 2.08 and current productivity was estimated at 0.5 kg m(-2) yr(-1) total fresh weight. A restocking programme is suggested to achieve a target population density of 10 ind m(-2), which would result in a potential production of 32 tons ha(-1) of whole scallops. Recommendations are also made for setting a maximum exploitation rate of 10% in an effort to promote sustainable use of the resource. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

TI Market responses to the US timber demand-supply situation of the 1990S:
   Implications for sustainable forest management
SO FOREST PRODUCTS JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB Since 1990 there has been a significant reduction in timber harvest on public lands in the western United States resulting from legal and administrative requirements to sustain biological diversity and other ecosystem functions. Growing demand in the U.S. market for wood products has been met in part by increasing imports from Canada and developing technology that can conserve wood inputs, use more abundant hardwood species, or integrate recycled fiber. These market reactions are generally supportive of sustainable forest management in the United States. Data are inconclusive or nonexistent on the extent of substitution of nonwood products and the extent of increased harvest on private lands.

AB Recent international agreements relating to forest practices are silent on operational criteria for sustainable forestry. Basic values to be sustained can be derived from the agreements. Goals for each value an presented that connect simply and directly with public concerns that inspired the agreements. For each goal a simple, relatively cheap means of monitoring is suggested that permits an operational approach. By focussing on the essence of international agreements, criteria for sustainable forestry are derived that are operational and scientifically credible, internationally credible, and socially responsible.

DT Article
DE Eastern Ontario Model Forest; community forestry; multi-stakeholder
   decision making
AB The Eastern Ontario Model Forest was created in 1992 as a grassroots organization, representing a wide diversity of players interested in Eastern Ontario's extensive privately-owned forested and agricultural lands. An initial series of intensive meetings eventually led to the adoption of an innovative board structure with strong representation from the membership at large including seats for industry, First Nations and provincial government and a constitution based on consensual decision-making. The Eastern Ontario Model Forest recognized the knowledge it would gain in developing sustainable forestry activities. From the outset, it clearly expressed in its goals and objectives a desire to participate in global initiatives for sustainable forestry, such as the development of criteria and indicators. Simultaneously, the Eastern Ontario Model Forest sought to become involved, again at the grassroots level, with a similar Model Forest outside of Canada. It established a unique twinning relationship with the Calakmul Model Forest in Mexico to enhance the flow of knowledge and experience between people faced with similar challenges. The experience gained from the Eastern Ontario Model Forest members' participation in local, national, global and back down to local Mexican forestry issues has helped improve the understanding and application of sustainable forestry principles in their own backyards. Simultaneously, the Eastern Ontario Model Forest expects that its own contributions in these same flora will help further the application sustainable forestry outside the Eastern Ontario Model Forest boundaries.

TI The role of long-term site productivity in maintaining healthy
   ecosystems: A prerequisite of ecosystem management
SO FORESTRY CHRONICLE
LA English
DT Article
DE forest health; ecosystem management; site productivity; nutrient cycling
ID PERSPECTIVES
AB Forest health is a central issue across North America. Most definitions imply that forest health is a condition of the forest ecosystem which sustains complexity or diversity while still providing for human needs. Imbedded in this definition is the need to maintain the productive capacity of managed sites. Although site productivity is largely a function of climate, soil properties, and the biotic potential of the vegetation occupying the site, forest management can also play an influential role in altering site productivity.
   In terms of site productivity, different concerns exist when managing different ecosites. Based on a recently-conducted expert opinion survey, the major concerns when harvesting black spruce from shallow-soil, upland sites were: 1) harvest-related nutrient removals, and 2) loss of organic matter. In contrast to these ecosites, the major concerns for organic sites (including wet, mineral soils) were: I)altered hydrology, and 2) rutting. The water table on these sites is typically near the surface for a significant portion of the frost-free season, minimizing organic matter decomposition and associated nutrient release. Any forest management practice which exacerbates this situation would have a negative impact on site productivity. Tree nutrient cycling studies conducted on shallow-soil sites in northwestern Ontario were presented to show that calculated nutrient replacement times, with the exception of K, did not exceed current rotation periods. However, the forest floor nutrient pool represented a major component of the soil reserves. Based on the importance of this nutrient pool, best practices designed to protect and allow for the rebuilding of this active soil pool are essential if long-term site productivity is to be maintained.
   This paper outlines a series of steps to evaluate and correct management-induced changes in long-term site productivity. These steps included: I) the development of "best practice" guidelines, 2) the development of a set of "criteria and indicators", and 3) the establishment of long-term experimental field trials. The results of this third step should, in turn, be used to refine the "best practice" guidelines and suggest alternative "criteria and indicators" that should be incorporated into a monitoring program of forest sustainability.

   sustainable tourism
SO GEOGRAPHICAL JOURNAL

DT Article
DE business and environment; sustainable tourism; environmental
   responsibility; marketing; self-regulation
AB This paper adds to the growing literature within geography on environmental regulation of business activities. The adoption of voluntary practices of environmental responsibility is discussed as a form of environmental regulation, and then applied to tourism using a survey of 69 companies and institutions in the UK outgoing tourism industry. Results indicate that business has adopted a wide range of practices, but considers them to be weak regulatory instruments because ultimate responsibility for change lies with host governments tia legislation. However, environmental protection may enhance business performance if voluntary practices could differentiate mass-market holiday packages and allow companies to compete on more than price alone. This paper, therefore, supports research from other industries which states that environmental practices may lead to commercial advantage if adopted proactively rather than in response to market demand for ethical or 'green' products. However, change may be accelerated by labelling 'green' or 'sustainable' tourism as 'quality' tourism, and by acknowledging that populist market demand may lead to stereotypical approaches to minorities or ecotourism not helpful to equitable development. Future debate should focus on common ground between regulators and business, and on shared responsibility for excluding 'free-rider' companies not willing to adopt practices.

   indigenous communities; sustainable agriculture
AB Puerto Ayacucho, capital of the Amazonian State in Venezuela, has experienced a rapid population growth during the last decade due to migration of indigenous communities living in the tropical rain forest who have settled in the nearby savanna, along the main highway. This poses the question of how to feed the growing population given the existing restrictions of low fertility soils, risk-of erosion, decreasing biodiversity and changes of consumption habits of the indigenous population due to transculturation. An increase of food production should meet the following criteria: be economically productive, ecologically sustainable and social equitable. By using these criteria, a variety of agrosystems (AS) ranging fi om the traditional conuco to the agroforestry practiced in the savanna by criollos, were evaluated.
   The Traditional Conuco (TC) could be considered economically and ecologically sustainable, as long as there is no population growth and there is enough forest land to open a new ''conuco'' and let the old one rest for a period longer than twenty years. Since there is not enough forest land available nearby Puerto Ayacucho, the TC is unsustainable in this area.
   The Conuco for Surplus (CS) and the Improved Conuco (IC) are not only, unable to feed a growing population, but also contribute further than the TC to deforestation and associated erosion as it is occurring in the adjacent forests of Puerto Ayacucho. Nonethe less, the worst situation in terms of economical and ecological unsustainability is the case of the Conuco in Fallow (CF).
   In contrast toe the conucos, there is a successful adaptation of agroforestry systems (AFS) in sandy savanna ultisols and entisols by amelioration of both soil structure and fertility when animal manure is used. Additionally, forest recovery has partially occurred spontaneously in the organic farm. Nonetheless, the extensive implementation of organic agro-forestal systems in the area is at the present time limited due to the high prices of animal feed. Therefore, governmemt policies addressed to achieve sustainable agriculture should consider the possibility to stimulate the AFS after identifying the best condition under which the indigenous as well the criollo could adopt such AS without cultural or social costs.

AB Preliminary studies: Focus group studies and facility reviews revealed poorly equipped and under-utilized emergency obstetric facilities in two rural communities in Cross River State, Nigeria. Interventions: Beginning in late 1992, state and local government leaders were contacted to sensitize them to the problem of maternal mortality and enlist their cooperation in activities to upgrade obstetric services. Results: A maternal health unit was created in the State Ministry of Health. Government officials were instrumental in upgrading hospital and polyclinic facilities, correcting staff shortages, repairing an ambulance, establishing a blood bank, granting leave to midwives for participation in skills workshops and facilitating dissemination of information Costs: Nineteen visits to government officials required approximately 33 person-days of the team's time. Transportation, communication and per diems ware also paid. Government contributed a considerable amount in staff time and provided venues for workshops. Conclusions; A great deal can be achieved to improve emergency obstetric services through collaboration with government. Support and cooperation of government leaders can also enhance sustainability of interventions. (C) 1997 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics.

AB Preliminary studies: Focus group discussions revealed that a lack of funds often contributed to a delay for women receiving treatment for obstetric complications. Interventions: Improvements were made in health facilities and transport, then, beginning in 1992, meetings were held to mobilize communities to establish emergency loan funds. Per capita levies were set and repayment was enforced by the most paramount chief of the area. Funds were managed by existing village development committees and loans were granted to women who could not pay hospital bills immediately. Results: Of the six chiefdoms contacted, two successfully established loan funds. Utilization of Bo Government Hospital by women with complications from the two chiefdoms with loan funds increased from five in 1992 to 12 in 1993. Utilization from other chiefdoms remained basically unchanged. Of women from loan fund chiefdoms, half paid their hospital bills in full and one-third paid in part. Costs: The cost of community mobilization was about US $472. Conclusions: The establishment of loan funds depended on strong community leadership and required substantial mobilization efforts. Where community loan funds are established, utilization of emergency obstetric care may increase. (C) 1997 International Federation of Gyneology and Obstetrics.

AB For eight years, the Prevention of Maternal Mortality (PMM) Network in West Africa designed, implemented and evaluated projects to reduce barriers to care for women with obstetric complications. Many valuable lessons were learned concerning program development and implementation. A multidisciplinary approach enabled the Network to address the various aspects of the problem; collaboration between teams encouraged the sharing of resources and experiences; and collaboration with government and communities enhanced project sustainability. Capacity building through long-term, systematic technical support resulted in a Network of proficient researchers. Existing human and material resources were utilized to enhance the feasibility and sustainability of projects - a strategy that could be adopted in other developing countries. Cost-tracking was used as a management and evaluation tool. The collective experience of the Network offers guidance for program planners and researchers working on maternal mortality in developing countries.

AB Since 1988, the Prevention of Maternal Mortality (PMM) Network has developed, implemented and evaluated projects that focus directly on prevention of maternal deaths. The Network, which consists of 11 multidisciplinary teams in West Africa and one at Columbia University, grew from discussions between the Carnegie Corporation of New York and researchers at Columbia School of Public Health. Its goals are: to strengthen capacities in developing countries; to provide program models for preventing maternal deaths; and to inform policymakers about the importance of maternal mortality. This paper describes the development and functioning of the Network. The initial steps included identifying interested partners in Africa and encouraging them to form multidisciplinary teams. Each African team received two grants: one to perform a needs assessment and then another to develop and implement projects based on the results. The Columbia team provided technical assistance in a variety of ways, including site visits, workshops and correspondence. Teams tested program models and reported findings both to local policymakers and in international fora. Collaboration with government and community leaders helped facilitate progress at all stages. At the PMM Network Results Conference in 1996, the teams decided to continue their work by forming the Regional PMM (RPMM) Network, an entirely African entity.

AB Preliminary studies: An appraisal of government health facilities documented generally poor conditions, a shortage of drugs and supplies, and inadequate skills among staff. Focus group discussions in the community revealed a lack of knowledge about obstetric complications and difficulty in reaching health facilities. Interventions: Improvements were made in services at primary health units (PHUs) through May 1993. Community motivators were trained in June and provided with bicycles and raingear in September 1993. Among their duties were community education, formation of village action groups for emergency transport and facilitation of referral for women with obstetric complications. Results: Between August 1992 and December 1995, women with major complications seen at the PHUs increased from nine to 16 per month, with fluctuations due to disruptions in services and civil strife. The proportion of women with complications who were referred by the community motivators diminished over time, dropping from 24% to 1% over the first two years (1993-1994) and then recovering somewhat to 10% in the final period of observation. Costs: The cost of this intervention was approximately US$5082, with about half coming from the project and the rest from the government (44%) and the community (8%). Conclusions: The project improved utilization of the PHUs by women with complications, indicating that once services are of acceptable quality, many women will use them. The contribution of the motivators was positive, though smaller than expected. (C) 1997 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics.

AB The Prevention of Maternal Mortality (PMM) Network designed and tested projects for reducing maternal deaths. The focus was on improving the availability, quality and utilization of emergency obstetric care (EmOC) for women with serious complications. Teams' projects included interventions in health facilities (to improve skills and services and reduce delays in treatment) and in communities (to address lack of transport, funds and information concerning obstetric complications) The teams' results, reported in this volume, offer several lessons for program planners. Despite difficult conditions in the project countries, the teams demonstrated that it is almost always possible to make improvements in the delivery of EmOC. Their work shows that EmOC can be improved not only by concentrating on hospitals and physicians, but also by focusing on peripheral facilities and other qualified staff. The teams' findings regarding utilization of EmOC suggest that more people utilize services when they know them to be functioning well. Community efforts, including education and mobilization, have a role to play in improving utilization once services are in place. Improving EmOC need not be costly, because in many areas the necessary facilities exist and staff are already in place. (C) 1997 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics.

AB Preliminary studies: Focus group discussions revealed delay in seeking and reaching emergency care as a factor contributing to maternal mortality in Njikoka Local Government Area. Interventions: After obstetric services at local hospitals had been upgraded, 48 community contact persons were recruited. They were trained to improve community awareness of obstetric complications and to facilitate referral of women with complications. They were responsible for establishing links with pregnant women, improving access to transport, and mobilizing the community to donate blood. Results: Over 18 months, community contact persons referred 18 women with major obstetric complications for treatment at health facilities. Fifty-two pregnant women were referred for other reasons. A total of 129 women were assisted by the community contact persons. This number declined sharply over time, from 60 in the first half of 1994 to 16 in the first half of 1995. Costs: The community contact persons intervention cost approximately US $635, with 64% coming from project funds, 25% from government and 11% from the community. Conclusions. Community contact persons can perform a valuable role in facilitating referral of women with obstetric complications and supporting health education activities.

DE Africa; Ghana; maternal mortality; community; utilization; cost
AB Preliminary studies: Focus group studies in the Ashanti region showed that people avoided utilizing health facilities because of lack of confidence in the services and concern about the availability of drugs and supplies, among other reasons. Interventions: After services at the health center were upgraded, community education activities began in early 1994. These activities were carried out through existing mechanisms - e.g. Ministry of Health (MOH) outreach workers and village health workers, public health nurses and midwives, and village health committees. They addressed a variety of audiences, including women's and church groups, emphasizing early recognition and treatment of obstetric complications, and the improved availability of services. Results. The number of women with obstetric complications admitted to the health center rose from 26 in 1993 to 73 in 1995. It was the impression of the health center staff that women were also coming for treatment more promptly. Costs: The cost of this intervention was US$1950. This was mostly project funds, with the government and community together contributing approximately one-fifth. Conclusions: Once services are available, community education and information activities can enhance utilization. The cost of such activities can be reduced, and sustainability promoted, by involving MOH personnel and community groups. (C) 1997 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics.

AB Preliminary studies: A study of institutions in Cross River State, Nigeria, revealed poor storage facilities and inadequate availability of blood. Focus group discussions highlighted people's fears and misconceptions about blood donations as important factors contributing to the problem. interventions. Blood facilities were upgraded in the teaching hospital and a secondary institution. Fifteen community mobilization sessions to improve attitudes and stimulate voluntary blood donation were conducted over three months in 1994. Non-cash incentives were offered, including certificates of honor, free blood screening and assurance of priority if a family member needed blood. Results: Blood donations to the teaching hospital maternity increased from 40 pints per month in 1991 to 81 in 1994. However, national strikes interrupted service and the increase was not sustained. At the secondary facility, blood transfusions increased from 14 in 1991 to 35 in 1995, with 100% of donations from volunteers. Costs: The cost of community mobilization for blood donation was US $17531. Conclusions: Increasing voluntary blood donations through non-cash incentives and community mobilization is possible. No conclusions may be drawn regarding sustainability, however. (C) 1997 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics.

AB The experience of the PMM Network offers several insights for donors seeking to work on maternal mortality, particularly in Africa where the risk of maternal death is highest. First, the projects provide evidence that multidisciplinary operations research can result in the development and implementation of successful, relatively low-cost interventions. In addition, the work of PMM highlights the need for greater donor funding to build and support partnerships - to include researchers, communities and policymakers - that enhance sustainability of efforts. Finally, the work of the teams confirms the benefits of donor commitment to building local capacity. (C) 1997 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics.

AB Preliminary studies: Focus group discussions and health facility inventories in a rural district hospital indicated a shortage of basic drugs and supplies. Interventions: The project procured obstetric drugs and supplies through a commercial source outside normal government channels. They were managed through the standard district system and made available at prices calculated to cover costs and an 85% mark-up. Obstetric emergency drug packs were created to ensure 24-h availability. Patients from the study area unable to pay at time of treatment were given credit and followed up. Results: No shortages of obstetric drugs occurred after interventions were introduced. Prices of drugs to obstetric patients ranged from 46% to 68% of the prices charged by the government hospital and private pharmacies. Of 26 obstetric patients from the study area who received drugs in 1993, 12 paid in full and nine paid in part. The total amount billed during 1993 was US $2537, of which $1451 was recovered. Costs: Improvements cost approximately $17500, of which 83% was used for the initial supply of drugs. Conclusions: Cost recovery systems for drugs can help maintain consistent drug supplies at health facilities. Careful pricing is critical. For the system to be sustainable, the mark-up must cover defaulters. (C) 1997 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics.

AB Field experiments were conducted to determine the effect of peanut crop incorporated as green manure on the growth, total dry weight and grain yield of succeeding wheat. Growth of wheat was improved in treatments where peanut plants were incorporated as green manure resulting in an increase in total yield and grain yield of wheat. Total yield and grain yield were significantly (P less than or equal to 0.05) higher in all the treatments of peanut fields than the corresponding treatments of fallow fields. This indicates the significant role of nodulated peanut plants in improving the yield of a succeeding wheat crop. When used in a rotation system, peanut may contribute significant amounts of nitrogen to the system and reduce the requirements for fertilizers considerably, especially for smallholder farmers. More information is required on agronomic and agricultural aspects of nodulated plants to enable the symbiotic system to be exploited to its maximum. The need is also appropriate for a more skillful blending of fertilizer nitrogen and fixed nitrogen particularly in sustainable agricultural systems.

TI A strategic framework to determine the best practicable environmental

AB Against a background of greater commitment towards sustainable development at a national, European and world-wide level, and a recognized need for more guidance in strategic appraisal methodologies, a framework has been developed for the strategic appraisal of transport plans in the United Kingdom. This framework has been designed to be quick and easy to use.
   The importance of social as well as environmental variables has been stressed and these are an implicit part of the framework, which seeks to identify the best practicable environmental option (BPEO). As such, it is a methodology for identifying the best alternative from a range of transport options and locations, prior to the application of project-level environmental impact assessment (EIA). Research techniques and indicators are recommended for the users of the framework.
   Care has been taken in the development of the framework to keep the analysis transparent. It seeks to present a full analysis in a clear and concise way; as a result, the final choice of alternative is clear to all participants and the decision is left entirely to the decision-makers.
   It is considered that the framework could provide a suitable starting point for appraisals of transport schemes throughout the U.K. and, when it is considered that social impact assessment principles developed in the United States have been modified for use in this framework, the framework should have potential applications in other countries with further modification. Wherever it is applied, the framework will get better as people use it and develop it. (C) 1997 Academic Press Limited.

AB Surface-mine reclamation is often hindered by the formation of acid minesoil and acid mine drainage from FeS2 oxidation, Surface soils containing FeS2 are often treated with crushed limestone (predominately CaCO3) to prevent acid minesoil formation, The main objective of this study was to evaluate the long-term effectiveness of liming pyritic minesoil to prevent the formation of acid minesoil and acid mine drainage, Pyritic minesoils that did not receive lime became acidic very rapidly and produced acidic leachate, Almost all of the FeS2 in this treatment oxidized during the first 200 d, The addition of lime at a rate of 25% of the theoretical acid-base account (ABA) significantly slowed FeS2 oxidation, but rapid oxidation ensued after the added lime was neutralized, Treatments receiving a liming hate of 50% ABA or greater remained neutral to alkaline throughout the study, Acid-base values and residual FeS2-CO3 data, however, indicate that the lime was dissolving from the system faster than the FeS2 was oxidizing, and all the treatments would eventually become acidic. The results indicate that the liming of a pyritic overburden to an ABA of 125% is not a sustainable solution to preventing acid minesoil and acid mine drainage.

AB While land application of sewage biosolids is the most expedient method of recycling plant nutrients, concern over trace element additions resulted in U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) beneficial-use regulations. We studied 11-yr biosolids addition effects on ammonium bicarbonate diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (AB-DTPA) and 4 M HNO3 extractable levels of soil Cd, Cu, Mo, Ni, P, Pb, and Zn, and the relationship between the soil-extractable concentrations. The soils at our four dryland wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) sites were Aridic Paleustolls (Weld and Plainer loam). For each application, we used four rates of biosolids (0, 7, 14, and 28 Mg ha(-1)) from the Littleton/Englewood, CO Wastewater Treatment Plant. We tested linear, quadratic, and either exponential-rise (plateau) or exponential-decay models for AB-DTPA- and 4 M HNO3-extractrable concentrations compared with the cumulative quantity of biosolids-borne element added and with elemental grain concentrations. Models for AB-DTPA-extractable Cu, P, Pb, and Zn and 4 M HNO3-extractable Cu and P vs. the cumulative quantity added produced R-2 values greater than or equal to 0.50. for monitoring soil levels of Cd, Cu, Mo, Ni, P, Pb, and Zn in Paleustolls (common soils in the western Great Plains dryland wheat areas) that continuously receive biosolids, we recommend AB-DTPA over 4 M HNO3 soil extractions. The AB-DTPA extractions also provide soil fertility information (NO3-N and plant available P, K, and micronutrients).

AB Sustainable, sustained, or survivable development are defined here as distinct "sustainability" constraints on intertemporal distribution in a context which ignores uncertainty environmental and intratemporal concerns. Such constraints are neither self-contradictory; nor redundant, for they can conflict with maximizing the present value of utility ("optimality"); nor inferior since the axioms underlying "optimality" are ethically arbitrary and refuted by empirical psychological data. Axiomatic arguments may clarify but cannot resolve debates about intertemporal concerns. Data suggest that sustainability constraints are nor respected, and that intertemporal welfare functions containing a preference for "sustained improuement" may better reflect what bodies politic mean by sustainability.

AB This paper introduces two axioms that capture the idea of sustainable development and characterizes the welfare criterion that they imply. The axioms require that neither the present nor the future should play a dictatorial role in society's choices over rime. Theorems I and 2 show there exist sustainable preferences which satisfy these axioms and provide a full characterization. Theorems 3-5 study a standard dynamical system representing the growth of a renewable-resource economy, give a "turnpike" theorem, and exhibit the differences between sustainable optima and the ones according to discounted utilitarianism.

AB Environmental economists have traditionally addressed the issue of choice under uncertainty by applying the expected utility hypothesis. When policymakers face a panel of experts with widely divergent beliefs, the problem may more accurately be described as a case of choice under pure uncertainty. Arrow and Hurwicz (1972) demonstrate that rational choice criteria under pure uncertainty will focus on the extremes of the state space, not the midpoint as is typically assumed. Using Nordhaus's DICE model, uncertainty-based choices about global warning policies are evaluated Linkages to the safe minimum standard and the precautionary principle are also discussed.

ID NET NATIONAL PRODUCT; SCARCITY; TRENDS
AB We derive a measure of national income, defined in terms of maximum sustainable per capita consumption. If population and interest rates are constant, the income generated by natural resource extraction is the return on resource wealth, defined as the present value of future resource rents. With a growing population or declining interest rate, sustainability requires net increases in wealth over time. The income fi om extraction of nonrenewable resources can exceed resource rents, contrary to the conclusions of El Serafy (1989) and Repetto et al. (1989). Finally, we present an example illustrating the hazard of consuming the full increment of Hicksian income.

SO LAND ECONOMICS

DT Article
ID INTERGENERATIONAL ALLOCATION; RESOURCES; EQUITY
AB We appraise neoclassical theory of growth with natural capital for the estimation of indicators for sustainability. Relationships between four theoretically distinct measures are clarified: Hicksian "change in capital stock value"; the Hartwick "net savings" (which excludes capital gains); "sustainable national income" (SNI); and "environmentally-adjusted net national product" (gNNP). An overlapping generations (OLG) general equilibrium model with depletable natural capital demonstrates the significance of model parameters determining technical feasibility and intertemporal distribution of consumption. Irremediable uncertainties in model specification and empirical measurement mean that the neoclassical theory is not robust for defining or estimating indicators for sustainability.

AB Admonitions to decision makers to "act sustainably" founder on conceptual ambiguities that transcend disciplinary boundaries and affect the definition and assessment of sustainability. In this article we address these underlying theoretical difficulties, paying special attention to two clusters of issues: reversibility and substitutability, and how to assess environmental values. In highlighting these two broad problem areas, we also note that cross-disciplinary disagreements cannot be resolved without making considerable progress in other areas of ecological and economic theory. We suggest that a "two-tiered" system might prove a useful beginning point for finding a more unified and interdisciplinary approach to decision making.

ID NATURAL-RESOURCES; UNCERTAINTY
AB This paper explores the relationship between sustainability concepts and contractarian principles of distributional fairness. A commitment to equality of opportunity between contemporaries entails that life opportunities should be nondiminishing from generation to generation. Defining sustainability as nondeclining utility Is analytically suggestive but practically problematic given the uncertainties that surround future preferences and technologies. Life opportunities may be sustained, however, by providing future generations with specific endowments of reproduced capital, technological capacity, natural resources, and environmental quality. In this setting, capital-resource substitutions are defensible only if there is compelling evidence that they would benefit both present and future generations.

AB The paper compares two approaches to the problem of achieving the social goals of sustainability and intergenerational efficiency. The first is a separated approach, where the results of standard benefit-cost analysis are (later) combined with intergenerational equity considerations. The second, in the tradition of institutional design, is an integrated approach, where efficiency and equity considerations are combined from the start. It appears that several well-known problems with discounting can be avoided or mitigated by the second approach.

AB Well-being depends on produced goods, natural amenities, and preferences. Each can be influenced through policies and education. Production of goods exhibits a hierarchical structure similar to ecosystems: subsystems adapt while sustaining system productivity, that is, higher levels have greater resilience In agriculture, the farm has little adaptability, the region can shift production among locations, and a nation can shift among regions. Forests exhibit an intertemporal-geographical hierarchy in which harvests are replaced by growth elsewhere and later regrowth. This structure is useful in responding to change and uncertainty. Preferences, too, can and must be informed through education.

AB Discounting is often considered inimical to sustainability. Reliance on the assumption that endowments regulate the transfer of assets to the future in standard growth models interprets the interest rate in the intergenerational context as a partial reflection of myopia. A more complete market model that allows agents from different generations to engage in long-term contracts with one another severs the movement of capital to the future from the endowment assumption. Adherence to the endowment assumption as a de facto market structure, not simply a modeling convenience, endorses sustainability policies that injure the future.

AB We have conducted a study based on single sperm typing in a family design to assess patterns of variability of the male recombination rate in cattle. 2214 sperm of 37 bulls were typed for 11 loci on bovine Chromosomes (Chrs) 6, 23, and the sex chromosomes. Statistically significant individual variability of the recombination rate was observed for one interval in the pseudoautosomal region (PAR) of the bovine sex chromosomes; one marker interval on bovine Chr 23 exhibited individual variability that was close to significance. Thirty-five of the bulls were members of six paternal halfsib groups, and highly significant variability between families was found for one interval in the PAR. This variability may be due to DNA sequence differences in the PAR or to a genetic control of the recombination activity in this region. It is demonstrated that differences in the recombination rate of the magnitude observed in the present study may have a considerable impact on the power of QTL mapping experiments as well as on the sustainability of marker-assisted selection strategies.

AB Research work at both international and national levels is focusing on developing sustainable development indicators. Their validity depends on a participative approach based on the economic, social and environmental issues at slakes for the development of a country, area or specific economic sector. The question of the sustainability of intensive agriculture is briefly broached here and indicators showing the issues highlighted ore put forward consideration by the actors involved.

ID SUSTAINABILITY
AB To implement integrated farming systems, it is necessary to have tools to evaluate the achievement of their agronomical and environmental objectives. To do that, a set of eight agroecological indicators is proposed to assess the impact of agricultural techniques on the environment: cropping plan, soil covering, N-management, crop rotation. An example of the calculation of the indicators pesticides and cropping plan is given for a farming system with a rapeseed crop. Some examples of indicators use are given at field and farm levels. Some simulations of pesticide indicator values in various soil and weather conditions and with different pesticide recommendations give on evaluation of their impacts on the environment.

AB Production-oriented cropping systems are strongly discussed both for economic and environmental concerns. Agronomists are currently developping new cropping systems, by reducing costs of production, by optimizing nitrogen and water management, by promoting non chemical control of pests, weeds and diseases. But, in these studies, the choice of genotypes is restricted by the commercial availability. Plant breeders could contribute more to the sustainability of agricultural production through the selection of genotypes characterized as follows: low nitrogen and water requirements, strong depolluting functions, drought-tolerant or escaping water deficit periods, multi-resistant to diseases, adapted to mechanical control or more competitive against weeds. This desirable evolution of ideotypes will cause some difficulties to the seed business.

AB This paper reviews the impact of resistance to fungicides and insecticides/acaricides on the way crop protection is practised. It is now clear that resistance can develop to virtually any crop-protection product, in any pest, fungal pathogen or even weed. As a limiting factor in crop protection, it is a fact of life. A positive side-effect is the precision with which products are used today, with increasing implementation of Integrated Pest Management (IPM) programmes. This is a vital step towards sustainability. This paper describes: past experiences; current status of resistance; how resistance management influences current crop protection practices; regulatory aspects; and the outlook for the future. It concludes that EU regulations on resistance management must be simple and workable. Chemicals will continue to have a central role in optimising yields from the world's crops, as new tools, including biotechnology, become available for crop protection and resistance management. The crop-protection industry's innovations and product stewardship programmes will contribute to sustainable agriculture. This will provide continued benefits to users, the environment and society.

DE resistance management; IRAC; IPM; crop-protection industry
AB Integrated pest management (IPM) and sustainable agriculture benefit from selective and environmentally benign crop-protection products. The performance of these products, however, is threatened by resistance. If it is to be prevented from standing in the path of progress, resistance must be managed. As agricultural practices move towards IPM and sustainable crop protection, selection pressure will. be concentrated on products which are compatible with these systems. Producers, researchers, government and extension workers cannot solve these complex problems alone. The key to success is collaboration. The Insecticide Resistance Action Committee (IRAC) was set up by the crop-protection industry in 1984 to promote and co-ordinate its contribution to resistance management. Today, it is collaborating with research institutes, government organisations and extension services to combat resistance. IRAC focuses on research and communication projects which reduce selection pressure, organising workshops in 'resistance hot spots' and providing input to draft legislation Selected examples of IRAC's collaborative work are described.

TI Bus priorities: a solution to urban congestion?
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF CIVIL ENGINEERS-TRANSPORT
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper briefly outlines the history and current development of bus priority in the UK with most examples being drawn from the London area. Current transport policy is examined, particularly encouraging use of public transport and pedestrian priority. Details of a number of sustainable transport studies are given and the extent to which bus priority can contribute to these. The discussion then proceeds to look at intensified bus priority systems and roadspace reallocation. The conclusion drawn is that for bus priorities to have a substantial impact on urban congestion, far higher levels of priority are required than is currently the case. Such schemes would need to form part of sustainable development policies reallocating roadspace to public transport, cyclists and pedestrians, thereby providing a viable alternative to the car for a higher proportion of trips.

DE international trade; renewable resources; sustainability
AB We consider trade between a 'consumer' country with an open access renewable resource and a 'conservationist' country that regulates resource harvesting to maximize domestic steady-state utility. In what we call the mild overuse case, the consumer country exports the resource good and suffers steady-state losses from trade, as suggested by the conventional wisdom that weak resource management standards confer a competitive advantage on domestic firms in the resource sector but cause welfare losses. Strikingly, however, when the resource stock is most in jeopardy, the conservationist country exports the resource good in steady state and both countries experience gains from trade.

   recycling; metals; mining; overburden; gangue
AB We are in a period of economic transition. The 'cowboy economy' of the past is obsolescent, if not obsolete. Environmental services are no longer free goods, and this fact is driving major changes. Recycling is the wave of the (immediate) future. The potential savings in terms of energy and capital have long been obvious. The savings in terms of reduced environmental impact are less obvious but increasingly important. The obstacle to greater use recycling has been the fact that economies of scale still favor large primary mining and smelting complexes over (necessarily) smaller and less centralized recyclers. But this advantage is declining over time as the inventory of potentially recyclable metals in industrialized society grows to the point that efficient collection and logistic systems, and efficient markets, justify significant investments in recycling. Increasing energy and other resource costs, together with increasing costs of waste treatment and disposal, will favor this shift in any case. But government policies, driven by unemployment and environmental concerns, taken together, may accelerate the shift by gradually reducing taxes on labor and increasing taxes on extractive resource use.

AB Zimbabwe's CAMPFIRE program is a grassroots natural resource management initiative promoting utilization of natural resources, usually wildlife, as an economic and sustainable land use option in Zimbabwe's rural areas. Under CAMPFIRE, the village of Masoka developed a plan to allocate a large portion of the land under its control to leased hunting safari operations. A smaller portion was protected by a wildlife fence and allocated to cultivation and settlement. This study examines the development consequences of this initiative with reference to the differential outcomes for men and women. The program, and associated development activity, has initiated many changes in village life. Some of these have led women into opportunities that were formerly not available, including formal education, cash payments, and paid employment. Although the process of change points to greater inclusion of women,. men still have substantially greater access to money from CAMPFIRE.

AB One of the most heated conservation battles in Japan was fought from 1981 to 1987 over the Forestry Agency's plan to log in Shiretoko National Park, highly regarded nationwide for its many unique characteristics. The preservation side argued for protection of the Shiretoko ecosystem for wildlife, which conflicted with the forestry side's claim of facilitated regeneration after logging and sustainable lumber production. Since little information on forest regeneration and wildlife communities in Shiretoko was available, the arguments from both sides contained many emotional factors. The Shiretoko controversy figures prominently in Japanese environmental conservation history because it resulted in new policies of national forest management by the Forestry Agency. In this article the course of the controversy is followed with background information on Japanese nature conservation systems and the Shiretoko National Park. Problems raised in the controversy are also discussed.

AB When temperate soils are cultivated, rates of organic matter mineralization rarely exceed 50% of total carbon (C) for about 50 to 100 years of cultivation, and the remaining soil organic matter contributes to soil quality by storing nutrients and providing aggregation, In weathered tropical soils, rates of C loss caused by cultivation are many times faster than those for temperate soils, with a substantial deterioration in soil quality often in less than 10 years. Here we examine the role of minerals and microaggregation in organic matter stability in the search for a stable organic C pool in a semiarid tropical soil (Oxisol) from the Chapada de Araripe in Pernambuco, NE Brazil. In this soil, 14% of the C and N was lost in 6 years of manual shifting cultivation, after which it was abandoned.
   Carbon in the sand fraction accounted for 22% of total soil C and declined by 40% upon cultivation, Although silt and silt-sized microaggregates accounted for only 10% of total soil mass, they contained nearly half the soil C, which declined by 13% during cultivation. Clay-associated C (27% of soil C) showed no decline because of a mass transfer from sand and silt-sized microaggregates to clay, probably as a result of their destabilization under cultivation. Chemical oxidation with 0.03 M KMnO4 was able to predict the proportion of labile C and indicated a decreased organic matter stability after cultivation. Density and magnetic fractionation indicated that organo-mineral complexes were broken down during cultivation, with a subsequent mineralization of C and redistribution to finer, lighter fractions. The most stable fraction appeared to be in silt-sized microaggregates and in clays of intermediate magnetic susceptibility, indicating its association with Fe of low crystallinity. Even this most resistant fraction showed a C-14 age of only about 100 years, approximately double that of the whole soil but only one-tenth of values typical of resistant fractions in temperate soils, This result indicates that organic matter of weathered tropical soils may be less stable than assumed, that rapid degradation of soil quality is possible, and that organic matter management should be a priority for sustainable agriculture.

SO SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL

AB Soil survey information combined with exploratory simulation modeling was used to define indicators for sustainable land management. In one soil series in the Netherlands (the genoform), three different phenoforms were formed as a result of different management practices. Locations mere identified using a soil map and interviews with farmers. Organic matter, bulk densities, and porosities were significantly different for the three phenoforms: biodynamic management (Bio), conventional management (Conv), and permanent grassland (Perm). By applying a dynamic simulation model for water movement, crop growth and N dynamics, the three phenoforms were analyzed in terms of sustainability indicators by defining four scenarios based on productivity and N leaching to the groundwater: (i) potential production, (ii) water-limited production, (iii) current management, and (iv) the environmental scenario. The latter was divided into EnvA: never exceeding the N-leaching threshold of 11.3 mg L-1; EnvB: exceedance occurring in one out of 30 yr; and EnvC: exceedance occurring in three out of 30 yr. Biodynamic management obtained the lowest yield under current management, while yields fur Perm were highest. EnvA could not be reached for Perm as a result of high mineralization rates. Obtainable yields for scenarios EnvA, EnvB, and EnvC differed substantially, illustrating the importance of selecting ''acceptable'' risks in environmental regulation. The presented methodology demonstrates the importance of pedological input in sustainability studies.

AB Maintenance and improvement of soil quality in continuous cropping systems is critical to sustaining agricultural productivity and environmental quality for future generations. This review focuses on lessons learned from long-term continuous cropping experiments. Soil organic carbon (SOC) is the most often reported attribute from long-term studies and is chosen as the most important indicator of soil quality and agronomic sustainability because of its impact on other physical, chemical and biological indicators of soil quality. Long-term studies have consistently shown the benefit of manures, adequate fertilization, and crop rotation on maintaining agronomic productivity by increasing C inputs into the soil. However, even with crop rotation and manure additions, continuous cropping results in a decline in SOC, although the rate and magnitude of the decline is affected by cropping and tillage system, climate and soil. In the oldest of these studies, the influence of tillage on SOC and dependent soil quality indicators can only be inferred from rotation treatments which included ley rotations (with their reduced frequency of tillage). The impact of tillage per se on SOC and soil quality has only been tested in the 'long-term' for about 30 yrs, since the advent of conservation tillage techniques, and only in developed countries in temperate regions. Long-term conservation tillage studies have shown that, within climatic limits: Conservation tillage can sustain or actually increase SOC when coupled with intensive cropping systems; and the need for sound rotation practices in order to maintain agronomic productivity and economic sustainability is more critical in conservation tillage systems than conventional tillage systems. Long-term tillage studies are in their infancy. Preserving and improving these valuable resources is critical to our development of soil management practices for sustaining soil quality in continuous cropping systems.

AB Modern concepts of time, space and man have stimulated the development of mobility as a means of enhancing access to social places. In the current development, however, a tendency towards hypermobility is observable. Hypermobility is excessive mobility that impacts negatively on the actual functioning of the transportation system. Problems of sustainability, accessibility and the quality of life may be viewed not only as limits to the expansion of mobility but also as symptoms of a distorted development affecting the quality of the transportation system itself. In exploring possibilities to overcome hypermobility, this paper implies a challenge for systems thinking and government policy. (C) 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Liberalisation and globalisation are contributing to the process of urban restructuring: as the roles of cities change, social groups gain or lose advantage. The paper examines the case of Latin America and questions whether spatial and social inequality are beyond social control, examining five propositions: (1) that inequalities in Latin American cities are not inevitably due to globalisation; (2) that what makes cities sustainable, economically and environmentally, is different for the various sections of their populations; (3) that the destinies of cities are not determined but are influenced by social agents; (4) that among the social agents are local politicians and managers; (5) that effective and sustained urban action needs managing.

AB The Earth Summit has brought an expansion in the literature examining intersections between urban development and environmental protection. The real struggles to balance the two competing agendas (growth versus protection) in cities are left to local planners. This paper is a case study of the work of Zanzibar's Commission for Lands and Environment for land control on the edge of Zanzibar city. The case study argues that balancing the competing agendas and delivering both economic and environmental sustainability depend upon flexibility, political will and public cost-effectiveness.

DE tour operators; sustainable; destination; impact
AB The objective of this study is to examine the tour operators' influence on the long term sustainability of destinations, The tour operators' activities are considered in detail in order to verify the hypothesis that the tour operator is one of the major influences for the nature of tourism demand, It is suggested that they are also instrumental in determining market trends and may affect the demand levels for the destinations, To verify the degree of influence by the mass and specialist tour operator, of varying sizes, their marketing strategies and operational tactics need to be examined critically in order to determine their hypothetical level of influencing the sustainability of a tourism destination, Tourism destinations in a long term successful sustainable tourism industry depend on the maintenance and sustenance of the 'right' level of demand, The tourism supply is mutually affected by demand characteristics, Sustainable tourism is dependent on the effective co-operation of all the stakeholders in the industry, for example, suppliers, intermediaries, public sector and consumers, This article reviews the trends of the UK tour operators; it examines the literature on sustainable tourism, reports the field research findings and discusses the relationship and effects of tour operators upon the sustainability of tourism destinations.

AB The aim of this research is to gain an insight into the perception of sustainable tourism, and to examine the ways in which it is implemented at the regional level, Using a case study of East Sussex in the UK, the research explores how the general principles of sustainable tourism at the macro level can be translated into workable practice, The research is focused on small businesses, as these form the majority of tourism enterprises, The data were captured using the technique of focus groups, Tracing the development of sustainable tourism as a starting point, three main themes are then explored, First, how well the concept of sustainability is understood by small businesses engaged in tourism, Second, how these sustainable concepts can be translated into workable practices and finally, the major barriers to implementing sustainable tourism by small businesses, The research reveals that despite a willingness on the part of small businesses to engage in sustainable activities those engaged in the tourism business have little understanding of the concept of sustainability. The vague principles do not easily translate into workable practice, The research identifies a number of barriers to successful implementation of sustainable tourism practices, the most prominent being a mistrust of government policy, poor administration and unclear lines of communication, The study concludes that despite the increased importance of sustainable tourism and the formulation of general principles and guidelines, cynical attitudes towards government policy and its implementation are significant barriers to the implementation of sustainable tourism practices in small businesses at the regional level.

AB The development of resistance to current chemical classes of broad-spectrum anthelmintics poses an undeniable threat to the long-term viability of the animal health industry. Alternative treatment strategies including vaccines, biological control and breeding of parasite-resistant animals are unlikely to be widely available in the near future and even then, they will be integrated with chemotherapy. To compound the severity of the situation there appears to be no new chemical class of anthelmintics, with unique mode of action, on the horizon. The significant cost of drug research and the development costs of a drug that is to be used in food-producing animals, together with the small market share of animal health products compared to human pharmaceutical/medical and cosmetic products, provide little incentive for anthelmintic development. The chemical actives that are currently available, are all that we are likely to have for the foreseeable future. If effective parasite treatment is to continue, existing actives must be used more efficiently. Recognising the potential for the animal's physiological behaviour to assist drug action is of significant value. Reduction of feed intake before oral, anthelmintic treatment slows ruminant digesta flow, prolongs and extends the availability and therefore increases efficacy, of the benzimidazole and ivermectin compounds. This is a cost effective option that can be employed which not only increases efficacy of 'older' compounds, but will be instrumental in prolonging the useful life of the 'newer' drugs. In a related approach the co-administration of metabolic inhibitors can prolong drug clearance and extend availability and increase the action of existing anthelmintics. However, given the large costs which would be associated with this development (host toxicity, residue safety) it is probable that the value of such combinations would be more appropriate for use in the treatment of non-food producing animals. The most promising approach for improved formulation lies in innovative delivery systems using chemical or physical carriers. Solubility-defining salts, oils, solid/drug matrices, liposomes and related microparticles that reduce drug absorption/metabolism and can specifically direct large quantities of active, over an extended or pre-determined period, to the site(s) of parasitic infection. The use of lipophilic actives/vehicles which deposit in and are released from body fat is of particular value in extending drug availability. The prophylactic action of extended drug residence time, when used with effective grazing/treatment management programmes, provides opportunities for sustainable antiparasitic action. Clearly, with the paucity of new chemical classes of anthelmintics, the use of 'intelligent' but still relatively inexpensive carriers/delivery systems for existing actives will form the basis of future parasite control.

AB Despite the array of anthelmintics and endectocides and delivery systems available for use in the prevention and control of nematode parasites of ruminants, the number of highly effective control programs that have been developed and even the number of such programs that have been successfully implemented in commercial animal production, there have been no recent innovations or discoveries in regard to strategies, new anthelmintics, or systems for controlling nematode parasites through anthelmintic use. In the traditional sense of chemotherapy-chemoprophylaxis, we have probably achieved the maximum effect of what is possible from excellent anthelmintics developed by the pharmaceutical industry over the last 35 years, i.e. from thiabendazole through levamisole and morantel tartrate, to more advanced benzimidazoles and to the avermectins and milbemycins. At the core of all anthelmintic treatment-related problems is the lingering conception among a large body of animal producers that anthelmintic treatment is the only effort needed to control parasitism and its effects on host animals. This concept has given rise to the long-standing difficulty of drug resistance in sheep nematodes and the not remote possibility of its development in nematodes of cattle. Along with this are serious concerns over environmental toxicity, tissue residues and enormous financial investment to develop new and novel anthelmintic compounds. Progress is being made in current and intensive searches for development and testing of control approaches alternative to anthelmintics, e.g. helminth vaccines, biological control agents such as fungi, selection of resistant sires, alternative chemicals and nematode growth regulators. A timetable for when alternative controls can be developed fully and put into practical use cannot be predicted. It is universally acknowledged among parasitologists that existing anthelmintics must be preserved and utilized judiciously to ensure continued effectiveness. A major example is to be found in strategic or integrated control programs in Australia developed over the last 10 years to combat widespread drug resistance in sheep. Major imperatives for future programs and systems of controlling nematode parasites of ruminants are improved means of getting producers to adopt proven and sustainable methods.

AB The development of sustainable farming systems depends on our ability to predict and manage the response of weed communities to changes in cropping practices. A study was established at Normandin, Quebec, Canada, to investigate the influence of liquid dairy manure and mineral fertilizer, as well as chisel and moldboard plow tillage systems, in a spring barley monoculture and a 3-yr spring barley-forage rotation that included red clover and timothy. Weed species richness (Margalef's D(MG)), evenness (Shannon's E), and diversity (Shannon's H') were examined in these treatments from 1992 to 1995. Nutrient source had no effect on any of the three diversity indices. Evenness values were extremely low in all years, suggesting dominance of a few weed species in most treatments. Weed species richness and diversity generally were greater in the barley-forage rotation compared with the monoculture. Tillage effects on richness and diversity varied with crop rotation. Margalef's D(MG) and Shannon's H' were greater in 1993 and 1995, but they were lower in 1994 when chisel was compared with moldboard plowing in the monoculture. In 1994, chickweed density was about five times greater in the chisel-plowed monoculture compared with other treatment combinations of rotation and tillage. In 1995, only one species with a density of six plants m(-2) occurred in the moldboard-plowed monoculture compared with three to six species and densities of 51 to 832 plants m(-2) in the other rotation by tillage treatments. Climatic conditions and herbicide use patterns in the different: crop rotation treatments may have contributed to the more dynamic nature of weed species diversity in the barley monoculture. Reduced frequency of tillage and herbicide application; management of the forage stands, especially with regard to their termination; and improved soil resource availability likely explained the increased but more stable diversity of the weed communities in the barley-forage rotation.

AB This paper discusses the challenges faced by rural development nongovernmental organization (NGOs) in the Andes and Chile within current contexts of public sector reform and economic liberalization. These changes, and the recognition that previous NGO initiatives have had limited impacts on rural poverty, have helped trigger crises of institutional identity, legitimacy and sustainability among NGOs. Among some NGOs, these crises have begun to elicit institutional responses that address the underlying weaknesses of the NGO sector, and identify more appropriate future roles and identities for NGOs. The paper discusses several such responses, and argues that these changes begin to remove long-standing distortions in the relationships between NGOs and their societies and economies, and thus offer the possibility of longer term institutional sustainability.

In the investigation, a multimethod approach is combined with a procedure that is comparative in several regards. Its findings show that in many cases German assistance succeeded in helping to increase the organizational effectiveness of the on-site implementing agency in a sustainable manner. The diffusion effects of such interventions remained, in contrast, rather modest. Here, it turns out to be decisive which variables are affected by project interventions. In conclusion, the study's findings serve as the basis for making recommendations for the planning and implementation of development projects. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper compares experiences in economic growth, income distribution, and poverty in different regions of the world. It examines the causes of interregional disparities in growth and distribution, assessing the nature of the link between growth and distribution. Among other results, it concludes that low inequality is most likely to be consistent with sustainable growth, and that positive growth is neither a sufficient nor a necessary condition for low inequality or poverty incidence. In the context of the new global economy, alleviation of inequality and poverty calls for an articulate strategy targeting on the marginalized population at large. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB On equal parts of benzene, toluene and p-xylene (BTX), a stable bacterial consortium was enriched for removal of BTX vapours from air. As demonstrated by gas chromatographic monitoring, this consortium removed all three BTX components but was able to grow only on benzene and/or toluene. A Pseudomonas strain, PPO1, isolated putida from this consortium behaved in an identical manner. When immobilized on a porous peat/perlite column, both the consortium and the PPO1 isolated removed all three BTX components from metered air streams. However, due to the accumulation of products from the incompletely metabolized p-xylene, the removal rates were unsatisfactory and declined further with time. P. putida ATCC 33015 bearing the TOL plasmid was capable of growing on toluene, on para-and on meta-xylene isomers, but not on benzene. When the PPO1 and ATCC 33015 strains were immobilized, in equal parts, on peat/perlite columns a much improved and sustainable removal of all three BTX components was observed at the rate of 40-50 g/h. m(3) filter bed. Due to the dominance of the ring-hydroxylating pathways over the TOL pathway, the classical enrichment approach did not result in a consortium capable of the sustained removal of all BTX components. However, a rationally formulated consortium consisting of members with complementary metabolic abilities was capable of this task and should be of use both in industrial emission control and in soil venting operations.

DT Article
AB This paper discusses some important reforms that will need to be implemented soon if Indian banking is to be put on a sound footing against a background of increasing global integration of the Indian economy (in both real and financial terms). The policies, drawing on international experience, are informed by the following objectives: (i) to enhance the flexibility of banks to respond effectively to changing circumstances (volatility); and (ii) to ensure the sustainability of the restitution of public sector banks. The measures discussed include maintaining a higher capital adequacy ratio; facilitating restructuring of the sector by formulating an exit and privatisation policy; implementing stricter and more transparent accounting and disclosure norms; and enhancing rule-based supervision.

AB In comparison to the summer of 1992, the winter of 1996 did not hear the symptoms of a significant downturn in economic growth, nor was there any threat of Balance of Payment crisis of 1992. Yet the stock market now bear a picture gloomier than in 1992. The real differences between the. conditions in 1992 and those in 1996 lie in the long-term factors of capital market growth. Viewed from this perspective, there are compelling reasons to believe that the emergence of certain adverse systemic factors have much to say about the recent slump than the macro-economic paradigms.

   VARIABILITY; ABUNDANCE; SKIPJACK; PLANKTON; BIOMASS
AB Nearly 70% of the world's annual tuna harvest, currently 3.2 million tonnes, comes from the Pacific Ocean. Skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis) dominate the catch. Although skipjack are distributed in the surface mixed layer throughout the equatorial and subtropical Pacific, catches are highest in the western equatorial Pacific warm pool, a region characterized by low primary productivity rates' that has the warmest surface waters of the world's oceans (Fig. 1). Assessments of tuna stocks indicate that recent western Pacific skipjack catches approaching one million tonnes annually are sustainable(2). The warm pool, which is fundamental to the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Earth's climate in general(3-5), must therefore also provide a habitat capable of supporting this highly productive tuna population. Here we show that apparent spatial shifts in the skipjack population are linked to large zonal displacements of the warm pool that occur during ENSO events(5,6). This relationship can be used to predict (several months in advance) the region of highest skipjack abundance, within a fishing ground extending over 6,000 km along the Equator.

TI Estimates of sub-national nutrient balances as sustainability indicators

AB Using a model, inputs and outputs of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium were calculated for Ecuadorian agro-ecosystems, in order to assess sustainability of different land use types in terms of a soil fertility balance. For 5 x 5 minute land cells of a homogeneous geographical grid covering the Ecuadorian territory, the nutrient balance was calculated on the basis of the separate contributions of the inputs and outputs: Mineral fertilizer, organic fertilizer, atmospheric deposition, biological N-fixation, sedimentation, harvested product, removed crop residues, leaching, gaseous losses and erosion. The estimates were aggregated to sub-national and national level. In general, the estimates show a depletion of the soil nutrient stock in Ecuadorian agro-ecosystems. At a national scale for the land use type temporary crops there is mainly a deficit of nitrogen (42 kg ha(-1) yr(-1)), while for permanent crops both nitrogen and potassium balances are clearly negative (40 and 25 kg ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively). For grassland overall, losses are smaller. Erosion is a major cause of nitrogen loss, leaching and denitrification also contribute significantly. In permanent crops relatively large amounts of potassium leave the agro-ecosystem through harvested products, due to high potassium concentrations in these products and high yields. At sub-national scale, nutrient depletion under current land use is more severe in the Andean region than the coastal region, mainly as a result of higher erosion losses. In the Andean region, this situation is likely to worsen due to the exploitation of marginal lands under the high pressure on the land. The Amazon region is still largely unexploited but this study suggests that the current conversion of forest to agricultural land, may cause serious nutrient balance problems at a local level. The presented approach allows the sub-national assessment of soil nutrient balances as sustainability indicator. It appears a useful tool to indicate areas of interest for more detailed follow-up studies. Furthermore, it may assist in the exploration of the effects of land use changes.

TI Target and instruments for the external sector with an open capital
   account
SO ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL WEEKLY
LA English
DT Article
AB The move to a market-determined exchange rate system alongside in private capital flows has constrained the authorities from using the exchange rate essentially as an instrument since ensuring a stable/non-appreciating exchange rate has become an objective in itself. The sacrifice of monetary independence resulting from large intervention pursued with a view to preventing significant real appreciation has brought to the fore the government's commitment to a sustainable level of current account deficit. But the conduct of exchange rate policy - whether to use the exchange rate as an instrument or a target - has turned increasingly complex. Consistently preventing the exchange rate from settling at levels justified by market forces may emerge as a major stumbling block in furthering the process of liberalisation of capital account transactions.
   This paper is an attempt to place in proper perspective the various issues relating to 'target' and 'instrument' for the external sector while focusing on the relevant strategic policy options that would be available to the country as it integrates further with the international financial system.

ID DECISION-ANALYSIS
AB Stakeholder analysis (SA) is a powerful tool for policy analysis and formulation, and has considerable potential in natural resource policy and programme development. It is an approach for understanding a system, and changes in it, by identifying key actors ol stakeholders and assessing their respective interests in that system. It has been developed in response to the challenge of multiple interests and objectives, and particularly the search for efficient, equitable and environmentally sustainable development strategies. This paper reviews the underlying concepts and methods of SA and the underlying links between economic efficiency, equity and environmental concerns. It examines the particular characteristics of natural resources management (NRM) which make it particularly appropriate for the application of SA. these include multiple uses and users of the resource, unclear or open access property rights, temporal tradeoffs; the presence of externalities; and imperfect markets. It discusses a classificational system which distinguishes between conflicts and trade-offs, and briefly reviews parallel methodological developments, including cost-benefit analysis (CBA), decision analysis, conflict resolution and social actor perspectives, and suggests areas of complementarity. A number of key issues are raised in the review that have implications for the future direction of SA. These include. the areas in which SA has particular relevance; its value to NRM policy-makers and others in overcoming tradeoffs and conflict, the different levels and circumstances in which it might most usefully be applied, and its potential for representing the interests of different groups, including the most disadvantaged, as the basis for interventions. The paper highlights some research and methodological needs directly relevant to natural resource managers and intended beneficiaries, namely: (a) acquiring empirical knowledge and understanding of the key stakeholders involved in the process and the factors governing their resource allocation procedures; (b) developing improved systems, frameworks and methodologies for analysing situations and incorporating stakeholder and institutional concerns; (c) developing knowledge of the opportunities and scope for action by policy-makers and facilitators in the design of interventions and the resolution of conflicts.

AB Systems methodologies are helping to reshape the way in which natural resource Research and Development (R&D) is conducted but they are under-utilised and under-researched This paper outlines some recent trends in systems thinking, and argues the case for the use and further development of systems methodologies for research and development in sustainable natural resource management (NRM R&D). Systems, or complexity, research reveals the inadequacy of development projects which are based on blueprints and certainty derived from linear projections into the future. Two strands of NRM R&D are explored: farming systems research (FSR) and systems learning, Both have been extended from farming to rural livelihood and food systems. This improves their holistic claims but increases demands on them. FSR acknowledges that both natural and socio-economic science are necessary to NRM but has had limited success in synthesising them. The systems learning strand is increasingly apparent but is still under-researched despite successes. Research to further adapt and develop systems methodologies in NRM contexts is identified.

AB In a context in which the framework of economic policy is changing radically, the objective of agricultural research programmes should be to support the development of systems which look likely to be 'winners' in the future. The Policy Analysis Matrix (PAM) framework permits sensitivity analysis in which an inventory of possible 'feasible' technological developments may be examined for their impact on the underlying comparative advantage (implicitly, the longer-run competitive advantage) of the system. This is a fruitful procedure for the integration of technological and economic analysis, and can make a substantial contribution to the identification of 'best-bet' lines of technological development. This paper begins with a brief account of the role and usefulness of the PAM, a relatively straightforward logical framework for policy analysis, fr om which a range of 'policy indicators' may be estimated. The most important of these indicators is the Domestic Resource Cost (DRC) ratio, an approximate indicator of the 'underlying comparative advantage' of a commodity system, a characteristic which may be obscured by an overlay of policy interventions and 'market failures'. The paper then explores two areas in which the use of the PAM can be extended. First, it examines the possibilities offered by the application of 'new institutional economics' (NIE) in a PAM context to changing rural market conditions precipitated by withdrawal of the state. Second, the paper reviews how PAM may be modified to incorporate environmental costs and benefits, and so address more adequately the sustainability of commodity systems.

AB The North American raccoon rabies epizootic continues to expand, now affecting most of New England. In 1990, raccoons became the vertebrate most often reported rabid in the United States. Emergence of this zoonosis poses increasing, but poorly defined risks to humans. This study analyzed various demographic, environmental, and behavioral factors associated with animal infection and human exposure before and during the epizootic in Connecticut. Rabies virus infections among terrestrial vertebrates were analyzed from 1985 through 1994. From March 1991, when the first case was diagnosed, through December 1994, 2,522 of 13,147 animals tested were found positive for rabies viral antigen. Forty-seven percent of the raccoons tested were infected, representing 88.0% of all animals found positive. Domestic animals constituted only 1.7% of positive test results, but 40.6% of the tests performed. The epizootic wave of transmission advanced approximately 30 km/year. Most rabies-positive wild animals were taken from private properties, usually near houses. Possible human exposures involved 939 people on 556 occasions through direct contact (20.7%) or indirectly through another animal (79.3%). Of 3,239 domestic animals exposed to rabies-positive wild animals, 18.4% lacked vaccination. Rabies has become enzootic in Connecticut and risk to humans and animals persists. The public health burden is considerable, yet knowledge is lacking to develop sustainable prevention strategies.

AB Despite owing its origins to the general concept of sustainable development, the subject of sustainable tourism appears to have evolved largely in isolation from the continuing debate on the meaning of the former. This paper argues that such isolation has resulted in the emergence of an overly simplistic and inflexible paradigm of sustainable tourism which fails to account for specific circumstances. It is suggested that the concept of sustainable tourism be redefined in terms of an over-arching paradigm which incorporates a range of approaches to the tourism/environment system within destination areas. These approaches are outlined for a variety of abstract situations with the aim of demonstrating the legitimacy of different perceptions of sustainable tourism. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB We review estimates of the spatial ecosystem support required to run a typical semi-intensive shrimp farm in a coastal mangrove area in Carribean Colombia, and to produce food inputs and process wastes for large-scale industrially managed tilapia cage culture and small-scale, semi-intensive tilapia pond farming in Lake Kariba, Zimbabwe. The tilapia farming is discussed in relation to the pelagic kapenta, Limnothrissa miodon (Boulenger), fishery and to inshore fisheries in the Lake.
   The results show that a semi-intensive shrimp farm needs a spatial ecosystem support-the ecological footprint-35 to 190 times the surface area of the pond, mainly mangrove area, Based on the analysis, we conclude that shrimp farming in Colombia is already utilizing close to the full support capacity of its coastal environment. In intensive tilapia cage farming, the ecological footprint for feed production is 10 000 times larger than the area of the cages. In contrast, a tilapia pond farm maintained on offals from fisheries, agriculture and households depends very little on external ecosystem areas. As long as there is a direct market for human consumption of all kapenta caught in the Lake, fish cage farming based on fish meal from kapenta would be doubtful from ethical, ecological as well as resource management points of view, even if it was economically feasible.

AB The present paper explores the relationships between aquaculture and the environment in Asia, focusing on the demands for environmental goods and services among different sectors. Aquaculture in the region accounts for 88% of global production by weight and 80% by value. Nevertheless, environmental problems are increasingly apparent and the higher the demands for environmental goods and services, the more negative the impacts.
   Against a background of rapid social, economic and political change, the paper considers how the sustainability of the industry is best assured. An integrated view of resource use, in which aquaculture is but one activity, is necessary for sustainable development. The roles of planning, education, research and environmental management schemes are discussed.

TI Stumbling blocks on the road to ecological taxes
SO ATW-INTERNATIONALE ZEITSCHRIFT FUR KERNENERGIE
LA German
DT Article
AB The German Federal Environmental Office in Berlin perceives the need for an ecological reform of the fiscal system. In this way, the ruthless exploitation of ecological resources is to be prevented In order to achieve a smooth structural reconfiguration an increase in energy taxes, especially oil taxes, step by step is proposed which is to follow a calculable schedule of annual increments announced in advance. ''Sustainable Germany'' is the magic formula under which this structural change is announced. However, it seems to be a road full of stumbling blocks. After all, if Germany alone were to adopt a system of ecological taxes, this would mean that investments would bypass the country and innovations would not materialize because of the resultant slower economic growth.
   There is another source of concern: The public is against being imposed more financial burdens by the government, even if new ecological taxes were to be offset by lower social charges.
   In order to restrict shifts of production abroad, it is foreseen that industries with high power consumption levels will be exempted from the higher taxes under certain conditions. However, this means creating arbitrary burdens. If in the end, the federal government were to burden only private energy consumers, the ecological success would not amount to very much unless private energy consumers were to be charged relatively stiff price increases. That constellation would imply profound disputes about a fair allocation of tax burdens. After all, ecological taxes can be classified as levies on specific goods and, thus, as specific consumption taxes.
   If ecological bases of assessment are to be reflected increasingly in the German system of taxation, the simplification of the international fiscal structure originally intended by this measure will be missed. Instead, the taxation system would become even more complicated The system of harmonized minimum taxation in the energy sector designed by the European Commission in Brussels is much less ambitious. The combination of energy tax and carbon dioxide (CO2) tax originally planned b), the European Commission has meanwhile been abandoned. The energy taxation concept proposed in Brussels has become much less ambitious: Coordinated tax levies are to be charged in all of Europe not only on oil products, but also on motor fuels and fuels for space heating as well as electricity. The principle of calculability is reflected in an increase, step by step, in minimum taxation rates. Although the price increases envisaged by Brussels seem to be reasonable, the many loopholes left to national implementation will make the whole exercise not very successful from the ecological point of view. Even if the harmonization of energy taxes were to succeed, this would not be tantamount to Germany embarking on the ''sustainable economic development'' desired by the German Federal Office for the Environment.

AB There is great interest in understanding how rangeland management practices affect the long-term sustainability of California oak woodland ecosystems through their influence on nutrient cycling. This study examines the effects of oak trees and low to moderate intensity grazing on soil properties and nutrient pools in a blue oak (Quercus douglasii H.&A.) woodland in the Sierra Nevada foothills of northern California. Four combinations of vegetation and management were investigated: oak with grazing, oak without grazing, open grasslands with grazing, and open grasslands without grazing. Results indicate that oak trees create islands of enhanced fertility through organic matter incorporation and nutrient cycling. Compared to adjacent grasslands, soils beneath the oak canopy have a lower bulk density, higher pH, and greater concentrations of organic carbon, nitrogen, total and available P, and exchangeable Ca, Mg, and K, especially in the upper soil horizons (0-35 cm). In contrast, the light grazing utilized at this site had minimal effects on soil properties which included an increase in the bulk density of the surface horizon and an increase in available P throughout the entire soil profile. While low to moderate intensity grazing has little effect at this study site, there could be much larger impacts under the more intensive grazing practices utilized on many rangelands. The lack of oak regeneration and oak tree removal to enhance forage production may eventually lead to large losses of nutrients and soil fertility from these ecosystems. Results of this study have important implications for predicting how management practices may potentially affect oak regeneration, water quality, and ecosystem sustainability.

DE peatland distribution; Sphagnum harvesting; growth measurement;
   conservation; management; sustainability
AB Sphagnum peatlands make up only a small fraction of the Gondwanic landscape when compared to Laurasian deposits. However, they are a distinctive and unusual habitat. This paper describes the biogeography of Sphagnum species and the distribution of Sphagnum peatlands in Australasia. Methods used and problems encountered in estimating Sphagnum growth rates are outlined. Growth rates for Sphagnum species are presented and factors affecting growth rates are suggested. The sustainability of Sphagnum harvesting is influenced by altitude, shade, watertable level and reseeding. The general decline in both growth rates and the recovery of the moss ecosystem after harvesting increases with altitude. This has ramifications for harvesting, management and conservation. As there is variability in recovery after moss harvesting, we outline methods that may assist recovery of harvested sites. The adequacacy of reservation of Sphagnum peatlands is addressed. This is pertinent as the conservation of Sphagnum peatlands is likely to be affected by drainage, burning, grazing, trampling, moss harvesting and peat mining. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

TI Hornbills Buceros spp. and culture in northern Borneo: Can they continue
   to co-exist?
SO BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
LA English
DT Article
DE hornbills; Borneo; culture; sustainable use
AB Helmeted Buceros vigil and rhinoceros B. rhinoceros hornbills are large, conspicuous birds in the forests of northern Borneo. Both are of enormous importance in local culture, being the subject of legends, ceremonies and beliefs. Tail feathers of both species are used in traditional costumes and dancing. Both are also hunted for their meat. Changes in access, technology and rural lifestyles mean that hunting is causing populations to decline or become locally extinct. The birds breed slowly and occur at low natural densities. Thus, hunting levels must be extremely low to be sustainable. A single team of traditional dancers uses about 400 rhinoceros hornbill feathers, which involves killing 40 birds. To hunt these sustainably, and to re-supply new feathers every five years, about 205 km(2) of forest is needed. Hunting levels currently exceed this in almost all forests in northern Borneo. A series of measures is needed to ensure that these birds survive in Borneo's forests, and not just in legend and in the form of a few decaying artefacts. (C) 1997 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

ID METHANE; SOILS
AB Agriculture's share including all direct and indirect processes such as clearing of forests in the tropics in anthropogenic global warming potential is about more than 30%. When the inappropriate cultivation methods and land use changes in the tropic and subtropic areas, which cause especially high CO2-emissions, are excluded agriculture's share is about 13%, now methane emissions (from livestock husbandry and rice paddies) and nitrous oxide emissions (due to nitrogen inputs to the soils) are predominating.
   In Austria agriculture's share in national warming potential is about 10%. If only emissions in direct connection with agricultural land use (incl. fuel consumption, use of mineral and organic N-fertilizers and use of plant protective agents, but excl. emissions from livestock husbandry and from use of electricity power, gas and fuel oil for heating) are included agriculture's share is about 5%.
   In the past specialization in agricultural production resulting in unbalanced crop rotations and intensification of soil cultivation might have contributed to degradation of organic carbon on arable land. However, topsoils are still an important carbon reservoir, which must be preserved by competent and sustainable soil cultivation (well balanced crop rotation,planting of cover crops, incorporation of crop residues in the soil).
   Agriculture may contribute a relevant amount to reduce emissions of climate affecting trace gases when the potential for biomass production is used. Extensification strategies in all fields of plant production should be further optimised for preserving natural resources and using energy inputs efficiently.

AB In the conflicting goals of sufficient food for a growing world population and conservation of natural ressources. the safe use of environmentally friendly pesticides plays an important role. A general concept of sustainable agriculture and how modern, efficient pesticides comply with the basic ideas of a sustainable farming are given and discussed. Modern pesticides often are mixtures of stereoisomers with largely different biological properties on the target and non-target organisms. More and more of these pesticides are used in enantiopure forms, leading to clearly reduced risks for the environment. The assessment of the fate, environmental concentrations and risks related to the use of a specific compound relies mainly on modern environmental analytical techniques, such as enantioselective high-resolution gas chromatography with various mass spectrometric detection techniques. Several of these techniques are described and selected results presented.

TI Sensitivity study of optimal CO2 emission paths using a simplified
   structural integrated assessment model (SIAM)
SO CLIMATIC CHANGE
LA English
DT Article
ID CLIMATE RESPONSE; GREENHOUSE GASES
AB A structurally highly simplified globally integrated coupled climate-economic costs model SIAM (Structural Integrated Assessment Model) is used to compute optimal paths of global CO2 emissions that minimize the net sum of climate damage and mitigation costs. The model is used to study the sensitivity of the computed optimal emission paths with respect to various critical input assumptions. The climate module is represented by a linearized impulse-response model calibrated against a coupled ocean-atmosphere general circulation climate model and a three-dimensional global carbon-cycle model. The cost terms are represented by strongly simplified expressions designed for maximal transparency with respect to sensitive input assumptions. These include the discount rates for mitigation and damage costs, the inertia of the socio-economic system, and the dependence of climate damages on the change in temperature and the rate of change of temperature. Different assumptions regarding these parameters are believed to be the cause of the marked divergences of existing cost-benefit analyses based on more sophisticated economic models.
   The long memory of the climate system implies that very long time horizons of several hundred years need to be considered to optimize CO2 emissions on time scales relevant for a policy of sustainable development. Cost-benefit analyses over shorter time scales of a century or two can lead to dangerous underestimates of the long term climatic impact of increasing greenhouse-gas emissions. To avert a major long term global warming, CO2 emissions need to be reduced ultimately to very low levels. However, the draw-down can be realized as a gradual transition process over many decades and even centuries. This should nevertheless not be interpreted as providing a time cushion for inaction: the transition becomes more costly the longer the necessary mitigation policies are delayed. However, the long time horizon provides adequate flexibility for later adjustments. Short term energy conservation alone is insufficient and can be viewed only as a useful measure in support of the necessary long term transition to carbon-free energy technologies. For standard climate damage cost expressions, optimal emission paths limiting long term global warming to acceptable sustainable development levels are recovered only if climate damage costs are not significantly discounted. Discounting of climate damages at normal economic rates yields emission paths that are only weakly reduced relative to business as usual scenarios, resulting in high global warming levels that are incompatible with the generally accepted requirements of sustainable development. The solutions are nevertheless logically consistent with the underlying discounting assumption, namely that the occurrence of global warming damages in the distant future as a result of present human activities is of negligible concern today. It follows that a commitment to long term sustainable development, if it in fact exists, should be expressed by an intertemporal relation for the value of the earth's future climate which does not degrade significantly over the time horizon relevant for climate change. Since the future climate is a common assett whose value cannot be determined on the market, the appropriate discount rate for future climate damages should be determined by an assessment of the public willingness to pay today for the mitigation of future climate change.
   To translate our general conclusions into quantitative cost estimates required by decision makers, the present exploratory study needs to be extended using more detailed disaggregated climate damage and mitigation cast estimates and more realistic socioeconomic models, including multi-actor interactions, inherent variability, the role of uncertainty and adaptive control strategies.

SO COASTAL MANAGEMENT

ID AQUACULTURE
AB Associated with the rapid increase in the production of cultured marine shrimp has been large-scale conversion of mangroves to shrimp ponds. Production in many regions has proved to be unsustainable, largely due to inappropriate construction methods, poor environmental conditions, overstocking, and disease. A number of shrimp ponds consequently are unproductive and lie idle. Accurate assessments of pond disuse are difficult to obtain; however, unofficial estimates have suggested that as many as 70% of ponds may be disused after a period in production. Pond construction, shrimp culture, and pond disuse lead to alterations to the physical and chemical properties of soil, hydrological conditions, and the flora and fauna composition of the pond area. The case for restoration, or rehabilitation to a sustainable use, is strong. Consideration must be given to the causes of production failure, the environmental conditions remaining following disuse, the needs and preferences of pond owners and coastal managers, and technical constraints.

AB Fishers from Caye Caulker, Belize, practice a territorial folk management system, which has contributed to level production of lobsters for over 30 years. This, in association with cooperative organization, has brought high economic returns to fishers. Tourism development on the caye has created a new market for lobsters, which has motivated some fishers to harvest undersized, prereproductive lobsters to sell to local restaurants. Data from interviews and observations suggest that this local system of resource management may be threatened because of a focal market for lobsters which has emerged with the growth of tourism at Caye Caulker. These unsustainable practices, coupled with an underfunded, understaffed, and in the fishers' experience, usually uncooperative Fisheries Department makes enforcement of state-level fisheries laws next to impossible. Caye Caulker fishers face challenging questions concerning how they will practice in and perceive the fishery, which includes participation with and perception of Belize's Fishery Department. Can their local adaptations prove resilient and sustainable in this rapidly changing socioeconomic environment?

AB Global competition is forcing American managers to rethink the way they do business. Competing in a global economy is going to require firms to understand what ''world class'' quality means. Marketing will play an ever-increasing role in total quality programs in the future as companies try to ensure that the quality they offer is what their customers want and quality efforts should focus on improving customer satisfaction at a reasonable cost.
   This research paper examined the premise that both quality and market orientation do indeed improve company performance in the areas of customer retention, sales growth and return on sales. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB In the knowledge-based society of the 21st century, the critical and only sustainable competitive advantage will be to have the ability to learn faster than the competitors. To meet the challenges of the 21st century universities must become learning organisations which are skilled at creating, acquiring and transferring knowledge, and at modifying their behaviour to reflect new knowledge and insights. To accommodate these new needs, a model for engineering education must be generated which is learning-based, practice-oriented and demands active involvement of the student.

AB In the discourse about sustainable development, 'constant natural capital' is frequently referred to as a criterion for ecological sustainability. Bur what is 'natural capital'? The concept will be analyzed by presenting arguments in favour of using the term and different versions of sustainability (strong and weak). Subsequently, a critique of the 'natural capital' concept is brought forward, from an ecological as well as from an economic perspective. Following this critique, the use of material inputs and the material input per unit of service (MIPS) as a measure for the environmental impact potential is suggested. Dematerialisation is understood to be an alternative management rule for sustainability. In conclusion, a change of perspective is proposed. Due to the conceptual and measurement problems associated with the 'constant-natural-capital' criterion (which refers to a stock), it seems more reasonable from a scientific as well as from a practical perspective to add flows (i.e. material inputs) to a decision criterion for whether a development is sustainable or not.

AB This paper presents two methods to quickly assess how local people's consumption is dependant on sources other than local or domestic. Weighted average source points (WASPs) or weighted average source distances (WASDs) for consumption origin are calculated and used to illustrate the extent to which the goods consumed come from places other than where the consumer lives. Two case-studies show the practicability of the methods. The first is a comparison between the consumption origins of tomatoes and carrots and the second a comparison between grape consumption origins in 1965 and 1992. Both the WASP and the WASD methods are easy to use and the results can be communicated in illustrative ways. These methods, however, give only an estimate of possible environmental impacts.

DT Article
AB We present projections of rural energy supply and demand and assess the contributions to global warming. The output of a dynamic system model is used in the LEAP model and overall energy balances are then compiled using a bottom-up approach. Biomass fuels constitute the major energy sources for rural people. A major share of the fuel is consumed for cooking using traditional stoves which have an efficiency less than 10%. Most of the biomass comes from crop wastes. Conservative estimates show tremendous pressure on rural forests for fuelwood. As the result, there is overcutting of rural forests resulting in environmental degradation. Bangladesh is responsible for a small fraction of the total anthropogenic contribution of CO2 but could be seriously affected by climatic change. Energy planning for sustainable development with LEAP is made more effective by using a complementary dynamic system model. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Limited resources of fossil energy carriers and increasing problems, like climate change, pollution and population growth, require new solutions to provide a global energy supply system. One of the most important questions is, which primary energy carriers can and should be used. To ensure a sustainable supply, unintentional impacts and interactions are necessarily to be considered. Thus, full examinations with regard to technology assessment (TA) have to be made. The problem of such sustainable feasibility studies is characterized by the aggregation of many criteria of different character to achieve a one-dimensional expression for evaluation. It is especially difficult to consider uncertain knowledge because it resists a description with classical mathematics. In this paper I present a fuzzy logic based assessment method which can be used as a decision tool. It allows the usage of aggregated indicators to consider any impact on arbitrary features. The method is applied to energy conversion technologies taking into account entire environmental aspects. If the assessment criteria are chosen for sustainability the result is a technology using renewable energy carriers. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Crop plant compensation for herbivory and the population dynamics of herbivores are two key elements in defining an herbivore's pest status. We studied the dynamics of natural, unmanipulated populations of the aphid Aphis gossypii on seedling plantings of cotton, Gossypium hirsutum and Gossypium barbadense, over a 4-year period in California's Central Valley. Aphid populations colonized all plantings, but reached densities in excess of 0.5 aphids/leaf during only one year (1991), when outbreaks occurred. Outbreak populations were, however, ephemeral; predation and parasitism suppressed aphid populations prior to the initiation of flower bud production, when cotton plant growth may become photosynthate-limited. Effective natural biological control was observed despite the action of hyperparasitoids and the heavy mortality of immature parasitoids that occurred when predators consumed parasitized aphids.
   We conducted manipulative experiments during 1991 and 1992 to quantify the ability of pre-reproductive G. hirsutum to compensate for aphid herbivory. In 1991 aphid populations in the high-damage treatment reached densities as high as any observed naturally during thp past 37 years. Damage symptoms were severe: leaf area was reduced by up to 58% and total above-ground plant biomass was reduced by 45%. By the time of crop harvest, however, plants had compensated fully for the early damage in each of the three traits that define cotton's economic value: the timing of crop maturation, the yield of cotton fiber, and the quality of cotton fiber. Aphid feeding damage did, however, produce some changes in plant architecture that persisted throughout the growing season, including a decrease in the number of vegetative branches. In 1992 aphid populations and associated damage were much lighter, but the qualitative responses to herbivory were consistent with those observed in 1991. Plant compensation for early damage was complete for economically significant measures, and vegetative branch production was again suppressed in mature cotton plants. There was no evidence for a change in the suitability of G. hirsutum as a host plant for A. gossypii as a result of early damage ('induced resistance'),
   We conclude that pre-reproductive G. hirsutum, which has not yet begun strong allocations to reproductive structures nr established architectural complexity, hac retained effective means nf compensating for herbivory Tn contrast to other systems exhibiting strong compensation, G. hirsutum appears to compensate in part by enhancing apical dominance. The recognition of early-season A. gossypii as non-pests is critical to the sustainability of cotton production, because it will allow growers to forego pesticide applications that accelerate the evolution of pesticide-resistance and disrupt natural communities of predators and parasitoids.

AB In this paper, we attempt to contribute to the growing environmental justice debate by exploring environmental equity in the forty-nine counties of Ontario, Canada. We use multiple regression analysis to address a central research question: what variables predict the location of pollution emissions? Data were extracted from the 1993 National Pollutant Release Inventory and the 1991 Census of Canada to assess relationships among socioeconomic class variables, industrial and land-use variables, and pollution emissions. The results agree with the findings of recent US studies. Manufacturing employment, urbanization variables, dwelling value, and household income were all significantly related to pollution emissions. These relationships took the same direction as in most of the US studies. In total, the four variables account for about 63% of the variation in pollution emissions (adjusted R-2 = 0.626, p < 0.0001). Contrary to a hypothesis of environmental inequity, the household income variable displayed a positive relationship with pollution emissions. A conceptual model of the development process is formulated to explain the positive relationship between pollution emissions and income levels. We conclude the paper with suggestions for future research.

TI New models for aid agencies seeking to improve housing for low-income
   groups: Side's initiatives in Costa Rica, Chile and Nicaragua - Sida,
   urban development division
SO ENVIRONMENT AND URBANIZATION
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper describes three initiatives funded by the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida) to improve housing and living conditions for low-income urban households in Latin America. All three centred on supporting the development of new homes or on improving or extending existing homes although each also had other components - for instance the provision of infrastructure and community services in existing settlements and support for income generation. All three included the setting-up or strengthening of institutions that would allow the initiatives to continue after Sida funding ceased; also the pooling of resources from national agencies, municipal authorities and low-income households. They all sought to involve the private sector, and strengthen and support democratic processes. After outlining the goals and characteristics that these three initiatives had in common, the paper gives short descriptions of each programme. It then considers their performance in reaching the intended beneficiaries, in keeping down costs and in ensuring that they were sustainable, and examines the relevance of these programmes for donor assisted interventions in other countries.

TI Determinants of sustainability of a Colombian hillside farm
SO EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
ID FRAMEWORK; SYSTEMS
AB This study applies systems simulation to characterize determinants of sustainability of a hillside farm in the upper Cauca River watershed of Colombia. A farm model linked to process-level crop models was used to simulate a set of farm scenarios. Sustainability, expressed as the probability of farm continuation, was estimated for each scenario based on replicated simulation with stochastic weather and price inputs. Hypotheses about determinants of sustainability were tested by sensitivity analysis. Results identify cropping system, area under cultivation, consumption requirements and crop prices as important determinants of sustainability. The study highlights the impacts of price variability and spatial diversification on farm risk and the results suggest ways to enhance the sustainability of the farm. The methodology was useful for integrating the diverse biophysical and economic factors that affect farm sustainability.

AB Per-recruit models were applied to the panga, Pterogymnus laniarius (Cuvier, 1830) an important endemic sparid bycatch resource on the Agulhas Bank, South Africa. Management advice based on predictions from yield-per-recruit, biomass-per-recruit and spawner biomass-per-recruit analysis showed evidence for limited further exploitation with a F-SB50 fishing strategy considered the most appropriate as it did not reduce the spawner biomass-per-recruit to less than 50% of unexploited levels. The slow growth and longevity of this species are shown to have important consequences for management, with a rapid decline in survivors past the age-at-50%-selectivity. Effort control was considered the most effective management tool as age-at-50%-selectivity occurred after age-at-sexual maturity and releasing undersized fish was undesirable due to heavy mortalities resulting from severe barotrauma.

AB Various methods have been proposed to calculate maximum sustainable yield, MSY, from biomass estimates, but the classical approach of Gulland, MSY = 0.5 M B-0 is still widely used, despite overwhelming theoretical and practical evidence pointing to its limited value, probably due to confusion as to the alternative methods available. A review of alternative methods is presented and their applicability to species with high values of M discussed. An extreme-value strategy is proposed for introducing considerations of risk and precaution into a management system based on precautionary reference points. We also focus on problems of estimating MSY and other reference points, review alternative estimators and discuss some of the ecological and life history criteria that affect how these estimators should be used: as targets or limits for exploitation, as indicators of conformity under sustainable harvesting conditions, or even for ecocertification of responsible or sustainable fisheries.

DT Article
DE Ethiopia; agricultural taxation; PAM
AB During the period of socialist rule (1974-1991), Ethiopian agriculture was subject to an array of policy interventions, This paper uses a policy analysis matrix (PAM) approach to determine the effects of various policies on different types of households and in aggregate, The analysis extends the usual use of PAMs by including consumption requirements and by addressing the variation in the impact of specific policies through time, Household models are used to quantify the effects of government intervention on both net consumers and net producers of cereals, The analysis reveals that although cereal purchases were sometimes subsidized through overvaluation, cereal-deficit households paid high prices because of market segmentation and experienced reduced incomes due to exchange rate distortions, Households that tended to be surplus faced substantial indirect taxes through low producer prices, Results suggest that undistorted markets could enable many farms to accumulate sufficient reserves to cope with production variations, but farms with average land availabilities are not sustainable given current technologies, even with efficient commodity markets, (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

SO FUTURES
LA English
DT Article
AB Future generations thinking provides a non-Western reading of space, time, nature and self, contrasting itself with the liberal openness of much of futures studies by asserting a non-negotiatable core. This includes a commitment to the family as a basic unit of analysis; inclusion of all sentient beings; belief in the repeatability of time; an inter-generational approach balancing ancestors and future generations; sustainable social and economic practices; a global focus; a spiritual and collective view towards choice and rationality; and the realization of a global ethics beyond postmodernity. In practice, however, future generations thinking often falls short of its claims. Nevertheless, if future generations thinking can become authentically multi-civilizational, it could create a new history for future generations. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Soils were collected from different depths (0-2.5 cm, 2.5-5 cm and 20-40 cm) one month, two years, and four years after clearfelling; of a mature, mixed species, coastal Eucalyptus forest in East Gippsland, Australia. Soil carbon, effective cation exchange capacity (CECe), amount of salt-extractable cations, and the chemical composition of equilibrium soil solutions from a number of sequential batch experiments were measured. For batch experiments, four different solutions were used (2 mM HCl, 2 mM NaOH, 2 mM KCl, and 1 mM CaCl2). Surface soil decreased in soil carbon, CECe, acid neutralisation capacity (ANC), and buffering capacity with time after clearfelling. A decrease in these soil properties indicates a long-term reduction in the ability to retain bases and to buffer input of protons.
   A coupled equilibrium model was used to describe soil chemical changes. The model included a solubility product of Al(OH)(3), selectivity characteristics of two different cation exchangers, and inorganic complexation of cations. The model explained the decrease in ANC of the soil when a decrease in the buffer capacity of a second exchanger (exchange of Al from carboxyl sites on organic matter) was incorporated. Model predictions for sorption experiments were fairly good when measured amounts of salt extractable cations were used as exchangeable amounts. Some differences between modelled and experimental values were found for Al and large differences were found for NH4+. One month after clearfelling, an imbalance in the adsorption/desorption of cations was found in the sorption experiments, indicating a need to include metal-organic complexes when describing the soil solution chemistry. Four years after clearfelling, no imbalance was found and the model satisfactorily described the sorption curves of all cations, except for NH4+. The data, especially the decrease in ANC, indicate that clearfelling should be avoided in a sustainable forest management. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB In semi-arid tropical Australia, basaltic lava flows with ages of 0.01, 0.89, 2.46, 2.64, 3.4 and 5.59 Ma show a trend of progressive soil thickness increase of ca. 0.30 m/Ma. This rate is 10 to 1000 times slower than most soils on unconsolidated parent materials such as alluvium, dune sand and glacial deposits. Reverse polarity magnetisation of pedogenic hematite in the lower B horizons of soils on the four oldest flows, indicates acquisition of the remanence prior to the Brunhes/Matuyama polarity transition at 0.78 Ma. Preservation of such a reverse polarity implies that the remanence carrier (pedogenic hematite) has been unchanged by chemical weathering or physical disturbance by soil biota for at least 0.78 Ma. A conceptual model of soil development is presented which implies that prior to 0.78 Ma soil weathering may have occurred to a greater depth because summer rainfall was significantly higher than present. The extremely slow rate of soil formation implied from these basaltic soils in northern Australia is a clear warning that agricultural use of such soils is unlikely to be sustainable against accelerated surface erosion.

AB This article discusses some of the environmental problems caused by soil erosion and suspended sediment transfer in a range of environments across the world The principal controls on water erosion and global patterns of sediment yield are briefly outlined and a series of examples are used to highlight the nature of fine sediment transfer and storage in river catchments. Land use change may trigger large increases in soil erosion and declines in soil fertility. Major economic losses may follow as downstream pollution and sedimentation problems intensify. Some of these major on-site and off-site soil loss problems are a matter of worldwide concern. Suspended sediment concentration is an important water quality parameter and good quality data on suspended sediment fluxes are vital for tbe sustainable management of river catchments.

AB Recent approaches to community-based natural resource management frequently present 'communities' as consensual units, able to act collectively in restoring population-resource imbalances or reestablishing harmonious relations between local livelihoods and stable environments. Arguing that these underlying assumptions and policy narratives are flawed as guidelines for policy, this article presents an alternative perspective which starts from the politics of resource access and central among diverse social actors, and sees patterns of environmental change as the outcomes of negotiation or contestation between their conflicting perspectives. The notion of 'environmental entitlements' encapsulates this shift in perspective, and provides analytical tools to specify the benefits that people gain from the environment which contribute to their well-being. The processes by which people gain environmental endowments and entitlements are, in rum, shaped by diverse institutions, both formal and informal.

SO IDS BULLETIN-INSTITUTE OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
AB 'Community-based sustainable development' has become central to the development rhetoric of the new South Africa, whereby local communities are expected to be involved in decisions from which they were previously excluded. But how do such processes work in practice, especially where conflicts over resource use are much in evidence! Through a case study of the Mkambati area of the Wild Coast in the Eastern Cape, this article explores how the interaction of social and ecological dynamics affects the livelihoods of the rural poor who live near protected conservation areas. Through the use of an environmental entitlements analysis, the case study shows how different social actors derive livelihoods from a range of natural resources and how access to and control over these resources is mediated by a set of interacting and overlapping institutions which are embedded in the political and social life of the area. An understanding of this complex set of institutional relationships is seen to be a vital precursor to establishing a framework for negotiation around competing claims, and the exploration of any co-management options for the nature reserve area.

AB The United Nations has made sustainable development one of its major objectives. But the way in which this is being pursued is likely to result in the UN system becoming increasingly marginalized in the process. This article suggests that far too much attention is given to international debates rather than to national and regional processes. The results of the UN Special Session of June 1997, called to review progress five years after the UN Earth Summit in Rio, weve poor Debate, in public at least, reverted to the traditional North-South divide. Yet in many countries the enthusiasm for the findings of the Earth Summit and its follow-up is clear What is argued is that governments need to sort out much more clearly what can and should be addressed at the international level. Many of the major environment issues, such as forest and biodiversity loss, are basically national or local concerns. The development agenda and poverty have to be addressed locally Only when it is clear that individual countries and regions cannot cope without international intervention, as happens in the case of climate change and the international trade regime, should the matter be of concern to the UN at the centre. The UN could do move to foster this sense of subsidiarity in its affairs.

AB Despite the considerable capacity of most Arab governments to invest in education for development, relatively little has been achieved in the vocational and technical sector. Yet, as is well known, it is the production of good quality technicians that is crucial to sustainable industrial development at a national level. In this paper we attempt an analysis of the situation - to identify key issues that need to be addressed if progress is to be made. Two broad problems underlie the contemporary crisis: aspects of Arabic culture that tend to constrain wider involvement in vocational and technical employment, and the low status of technical education in the Western model of education bequeathed to these nations by the legacy of colonialism.

TI A cost analysis of family planning in Bangladesh
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE cost analysis; efficiency; family planning
AB This article presents a step-down cost analysis using secondary data sources from 26 Bangladesh non-government organizations (NGOs) providing family planning services under a US Agency for International Development-funded umbrella organization. The unit costs of the NGOs' Maternal-Child Health (MCH) clinics and community-based distribution (CBD) systems were calculated and found to be minimally different. Several simulations were conducted to investigate the impact of alternative cost-reduction measures.
   The more general financial analysis proved more insightful than the unit cost analysis in terms of identifying means by which to improve the efficiency of the family planning operations of these NGOs. The analysis revealed that 56 per cent of total expenditures in the two-tiered umbrella's organizational structure are incurred in management operations and overheads. Of the remaining 44 per cent of project expenditures, 39 per cent is spent on the CBD program and 5 per cent on the MCH clinics. Within the CBD program, most resources are spent providing 4 million contacts (two-thirds of the annual total) which do not involve contraceptive re-supply. The clinics devote more resources to providing MCH services than to providing family planning services.
   The findings suggest that significant savings could be generated by containing administrative costs, improving operational efficiency, and reducing unnecessary or redundant fieldworker contacts. The magnitude of the potential savings raises a fundamental question about the continued viability and sustainability of this supply-driven CBD strategy. (C) 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Depletion of fossil fuels and environmental considerations have led engineers and scientists to anticipate the need to develop a clean, renewable and sustainable energy system. In general, they agree that in such a system hydrogen will be used as an energy carrier.
   One of the areas in which hydrogen will be replacing fossil fuels is air transportation, an area that has been under research for several decades. Hydrogen as an energy carrier for use in airplanes has some unique attributes like global availability, safety, minimum pollution and light weight, making it an ideal fuel. This paper briefly reviews hydrogen as a fuel in aviation, compares it with other aviation fuels, and discusses the possible future developments and the goals in this held.

TI Can we make IPM work for resource-poor farmers in sub-Saharan Africa?
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PEST MANAGEMENT
LA English

DE sub-Saharan Africa; integrated pest management; resource-poor farmers;
   participatory extension; crop protection
ID CROP PROTECTION; MANAGEMENT; PESTS
AB Most farmers in sub-Saharan Africa are resource-poor in terms of access to natural resources, credit, information and external inputs. In traditional cropping systems, crop protection is based on a combination of techniques to constrain pest development: IPM 'avant la lettre'. Resource-poor farmers are experimenters and inventors, who learn and generate their own technology. Their agricultural practices are often very well adapted to the agro-ecological and socio-economic conditions, and farming systems are flexible and responsive to all kinds of risks, including those of pests. These low-external input systems often operate near the optimum, but generally do not produce high yields. To increase yields and reduce crop losses, agricultural development programmes have been launched. Subsidized pesticides were made easily available and have been a major factor in disrupting traditional pest management practices. The technology transfer model has been used, based on results of formal research which did not take very much into consideration the typical agro-ecological, human health, environmental and social aspects of low external input systems. A more integrated, site-specific approach to development is necessary to solve the many problems related to sustainability in agriculture. The original concept of IPM emerged in response to the negative consequences of chemical pest management in high external-input agriculture. However, for resource-poor farmers, IPM should be considered a methodology for arriving at appropriate pest management systems using participatory methods in problem definition and technology development. The informal research and development capacity in Africa should be the basis for a resource-poor farmer Green Revolution 'from within'. This approach of stimulating the farmer to become an experimenter and a generator of technology goes against most of the current thinking on agricultural policy, research and extension, but it is in our opinion the only way to achieve the full potential of IPM in Africa.

AB 1. Management of the eucalyptus defoliating beetle Chrysophtharta bimaculata is considered essential to the economic sustainability of timber production in Tasmanian eucalyptus plantations. This study examined population subdivision and host associations in Chrysophtharta bimaculata. We aimed to identify the spatial scale at which management practices should be implemented, and to aid in the development of long-term management strategies that avoid the build up of resistance to chemical or biological insecticides.
   2. Genetic variation and gene flow among C. bimaculata subpopulations was examined using cellulose acetate gel electrophoresis. Subpopulations in central Tasmania were found to exchange relatively large numbers of immigrants, and could not be distinguished from a single large interbreeding population.
   3. Restrictions to gene flow not related to geographical distance were observed among northern regional subpopulations. Our results are consistent with gene flow between northern subpopulations occurring primarily via movement into and out of central Tasmania along a limited number of gene how corridors. We suggest that the clearing of eucalypt ash forests for agriculture in the north-west, north-east and the 'Midlands' region may be partially responsible for the restricted pattern of gene flow observed among northern sites.
   4. Adjacent subpopulations collected from different hosts at three locations show no evidence of genetic differentiation. Therefore, significant regional scale population subdivision does not occur on the basis of host species.
   5. That moderate to high levels of gene flow occur among beetles from all districts and hosts, implies that resistance build up is unlikely to occur if control agents are used at low levels and against a limited number of subpopulations. However, any increase in the frequency of resistant genotypes at sites where control measures have been implemented implies that resistance is being exported to all other subpopulations. This may be a particular problem in northern regional subpopulations, where reduced immigration may facilitate the local build up of resistance under a significantly less intensive control regime.

DE fixed exchange rates; credibility; sustainability; multiple equilibria
AB This paper analyzes the sustainability of fixed exchange rates by extending the time inconsistency framework to a fully dynamic context in which the level of a state variable (in this case debt) determines the payoffs available to the government at each point in time. The model yields the following results. If debt is sufficiently low, there is an equilibrium in which the government does not devalue. For an intermediate range of debt levels, the government devalues in response to an attack but not otherwise, so that self-fulfilling attacks can occur. Finally, for yet another debt range there can also be sunspot equilibria in which an attack (and the corresponding devaluation) occurs with positive probability. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

CL BOGOTA, COLOMBIA
DE stabilization; exchange rates; fiscal policy
ID PAYMENTS CRISES; BALANCE; ECONOMY
AB This paper studies the dynamics of inconsistent exchange rate-based stabilization policy-a policy that fixes the exchange rate without an underlying fiscal adjustment to ensure that the exchange rate policy is sustainable in the long run-in a model where the perception that exchange rate policy temporarily leads to an initial expansion in consumption that generates an increase in tax revenues large enough to eliminate the ex-ante fiscal deficit. Therefore an ex-ante inconsistent stabilization program displays, ex-post, all the features of a fiscally consistent one; i.e., a fixed exchange rate and no fiscal deficit. in contrast to the standard results, where the inconsistency between fiscal and exchange rate policy leads to a steady loss of international reserves and culminates in a 'Krugman type' balance of payments crisis, this model predicts that along the path towards the balance of payments crisis the economy displays no fiscal deficit and enjoys increasing international reserves.

AB We examined the effects of grazing and three exclosure treatments (no grazing, no-grazing plus oversewing, and no grazing plus oversewing plus fertilizer) on soils (Ustochrepts) and biomass of tussock grasslands on hill country under a mean annual rainfall of about 500-600 mm in the Benmore Range, South Island, New Zealand.
   Excluding grazing by sheep and rabbits for 15 years, with no oversewing or fertilizer, resulted in a two-to three-fold increase in the total biomass (roots + litter + herbage) relative to the grazed treatment. On all three exclosure treatments root biomass was approximately doubled in relation to root biomass on the grazed treatment. With the exception of Mg, total nutrient pools in biomass plus soil were lowest in the grazed treatment. Oversewing alone, without added fertilizer, maintained soil pH at pre-exclosure values and prevented exchangeable Ca, Mg and K decline, but had no significant effect on soil C, N or P. In contrast, oversewing and fertilizing had the effect of increasing soil C and N by 5.7 t/ha and 0.6 t/ha respectively, relative to the ungrazed treatment, and by 8.7 t/ha and 0.87 t/ha respectively, relative to the grazed treatment. Under ungrazed, grazed, and the oversewn + fertilizer treatments pH declined relative to pre-exclosure values and values on the oversewn treatment. The lower pH under the oversown + fertilizer treatment was attributed to the direct and indirect acidifying effects of elemental S fertilizer, while the lower pH of the ungrazed treatment was attributed, in part, to the acidifying effect of Hieracium pilosella, with both cation removal by animals and Hieracium effects likely to have lowered pH in the grazed treatment.
   A positive balance of 425 kg/ha of Ca, 680 kg/ha of K and 1900 kg/ha of N remained in total biomass plus soil on the oversown + fertilizer treatment, after fertilizer additions and previous herbage removals were taken into account. The positive Ca and K balance was attributed to release of nutrients by soil weathering, and the N balance to N fixation by legumes.
   Grazing of seasonally dry South Island tussock grasslands on hilly land, even at the present low levels, without fertilizing, appears incompatible with the maintenance of soil pH and carbon and total soil and biomass nutrients. (C) 1997 Academic Press Limited.

TI Cruise visitor impressions of the environment of the Shannon-Erne
   waterways system
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE Shannon-Erne; cruising; environment; user perceptions; river/canal
   management
AB This paper examines visitor reactions to a varied inland water environment and the management implications that result. It is based on a survey of cruising on the interlinked systems of Lough Erne, the Shannon-Erne Waterway and the River Shannon in north-west Ireland. Knowledge of visitors' demands and reactions to water bodies and bankside features is considered vital to the successful management of waterways, particularly in the context of developing a sustainable tourism product that demands the preservation of the integrity of the environment. The study is opportune in that the 1994 reopening of the Shannon-Erne Waterway allows the implementation of safeguards at an early stage of development when scope for influencing the future is greater.
   The results are useful in providing an insight into what visitors value, so that these can be considered while simultaneously providing for expansion in an economically deprived region. An incomplete understanding of the environmental system is evident in the common assumption that no conflicts exist. Specific considerations for management include the need to preserve the core features of an unspoiled and tranquil rural landscape through careful siting of additional mooring sites and other infrastructural support, and zonation and other restrictions on more intrusive water-sports. Some false perceptions of environmental conditions need countering through provision of information, and a code of practice is required to minimize depletions of fish stocks that provide an important ancillary recreational activity. Present pressures on the natural environment are not great, but may grow following initial good publicity, although much is dependent upon political events in Northern Ireland.

AB It has been hypothesised that regional endothermy has evolved in the muscle of some tunas to enhance the locomotory performance of the fish by increasing muscle power output, Using the work loop technique, we have determined the relationship between cycle frequency and power output, over a range of temperatures, in isolated bundles of slow muscle fibres from the endothermic yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) and its ectothermic relative the bonito (Sai da chiliensis), Power output in all preparations was highly temperature-dependent. A counter-current heat exchanger which could maintain a 10 degrees C temperature differential would typically double maximum muscle power output and the frequency at which maximum power is generated (f(opt)) The deep slow muscle of the tuna was able to operate at higher temperatures than slow muscle from the bonito, but was more sensitive to temperature change than more superficially located slow fibres from both tuna and bonito, This suggests that it has undergone some evolutionary specialisation for operation at higher, but relatively stable, temperatures, f(opt) of slow muscle was higher than the tailbeat frequency of undisturbed cruising tuna and, together with the high intrinsic power output of the slow muscle mass, suggests that cruising fish have a substantial slow muscle power reserve, This reserve should be sufficient to power significantly higher sustainable swimming speeds presumably at lower energetic cost than if intrinsically less efficient fast fibres were recruited.

AB Human and environmental needs sometimes conflict: the more for the environment, the less for the people and vice versa. Environmental needs include soil water, wetlands, lakes, rivers and estuaries. The paper recognizes that all these aspects must be catered for, but focuses on the flow needs of rivers; in particular, it suggests a method to determine river-flow targets which are objective, sustainable, integrated with river-quality characteristics and economically justified. Such targets could help the Environment Agency to balance human and environmental water needs in a rational manner.

AB We examined the number, sex, and age composition of polar bears (Ursus maritimus) killed by harvest, destroyed as problem bears, relocated to toes, and killed during handling from western Hudson Bay between 1966 and 1992. Harvest and removal of problem bears were biased towards males (66.7-70.1%) with most bears (71.7%) taken under a managed quota, but destruction of problem bears (13.6%) was also an important component of removal. An average of 42 bears per year were removed from the population with a mean age of 5.3 years for females and 6.1 years for males. Females were most vulnerable to harvest at 1-4 years of age and males at 2-4 years. Number of bears removed each year averaged 6% of the population and adult females removed represented 1% of the population. The harvest appeared sustainable due to the male bias and young age of harvested bears. Male-biased harvest was the most likely explanation for the preponderance of females in the population.

DE peri-urban; dairy policy; Tanzania; Africa; urban agriculture
AB This paper provides an analysis of 50 years of policy aimed at ensuring an adequate milk supply to Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, Despite a variety of policy approaches and initiatives, providing the city with milk continues to be problematic. The use of the peri-urban zone for dairy production is one of several recurring themes, however, even with an expanding market there has been relatively little development of commercial dairying in this zone. This history is used to assess the more recent interest in the potential contribution of the periurban zone to sustainable urban food supplies, The paper argues that policy and development initiatives along these lines must specifically consider the relative suitability of the peri-urban zone vis-a-vis the production of specific commodities as well as potential market opportunities, Those interested in promoting peri-urban agriculture as an more sustainable cities to take a narrow view that ignores either agro-ecological, economic and regional realities.

TI Large ranches as conservation tools in the Venezuelan llanos
SO ORYX
LA English

ID CAPYBARAS
AB Traditionally, wildlife conservation efforts have concentrated on the establishment of national parks and reserves. Additional strategies are needed if we are to conserve more than a small proportion of the world's natural habitats and their wildlife. One such strategy is the application of wildlife conservation regulations by private land owners on their properties. This paper uses examples of ranches in the seasonally flooded Ilanos of Venezuela to evaluate if effective wildlife conservation can coexist with sustainable wildlife use and cattle production. Income estimates derived from cattle production data varied among ranches from $US7.1 to $US26.4 per ha, while estimates of potential additional income through regulated capybara Hydrochaeris hydrochaeris and caiman Caiman crocodilus exploitation ranged up to $US7.7 per ha. The economic benefits of capybara and caiman harvests can be realized only by protecting wildlife habitat. Thus, it is suggested that large ranches in the Ilanos can play a major role in wildlife conservation as well as provide economic gains for those involved. Common denominators for success are: personal involvement of owners, effective patrolling systems, co-operation of neighbouring ranchers in patrolling activities, and ranches being located far from densely populated areas. For the programmes to succeed in the long term, government and conservation agencies will need to give Ii-lore support to landowners.

AB The measure of rainfall erosive potential is becoming object of many studies, since this parameter is indispensable in the studies of models for the prediction of soil losses through hydrical erosion. This study was carried out at EMGOPA/Embrapa-CNPS experimental station, to determine the rainfall erosivity for the Goiania region, GO, Brazil, through rainfall graphical data. The rainfall annual average erosivity for the region was 8353.0 MJ mm ha(-1) h(-1) year(-1) and 129.8 MJ ha(-1) year(-1), respectively for EI30 and KE>25. The correlation coefficients showed that the rainfall and rainfall coefficient allow to estimate the rainfall erosivity in the absence of more complete rainfall data. The erosion critical period, due to the occurrence of erosive rainfalls is from September to February, when 85.70% and 84.05% of the KE>25 and EI30 annual total, respectively, occurr. In this period, conservation practices are necessary in order to reduce the hydrical erosion, for the maintenance of soil sustainability.

TI 'Consensus' participation: an example for protected areas planning
SO PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID RURAL APPRAISAL
AB This article forwards the argument that combining institutional and people participation is fundamental to the pursuit of 'sustainability'. A generalized model of participation is proposed based on building consensus and preventing/resolving conflict between all stakeholders who might be influential in, or affected by, the effect of major developments on a society's goals for sustainability. This 'consensus' participation model seeks to overcome problems relating to the exclusive nature of community-based 'popular' participation (such as Participatory Rural Appraisal), and the narrow economic nature of current 'stakeholder' participation. The model is founded upon two ideas: that to achieve consensus requires stakeholders to negotiate and reach agreement collaboratively, and that certain stakeholders (e.g. the disenfranchised poor and entrenched government bureaucracies) are often polarized from a capability to contribute effectively to this process. In a manner similar to the introduction of methodologies to guide environmental management in project planning (environmental impact assessment? land use evaluation etc.), it is suggested that methodological frameworks are needed to aid the process of integrating 'consensus' participation within major development initiatives (large-scale projects, sectoral programmes, strategic land use or resource management planning, and regional and national policy formulation). Based on research in Zambia, an example of a consensus-orientated participation framework is presented, designed to guide preparation of strategic management plans for protected areas. The example is used to draw out some of the benefits of 'consensus' participation. (C) 1997 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI Heavy metals input with phosphate fertilizers used in Argentina
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE heavy metals; phosphate fertilizers; human food chain; soil
ID IMPACT
AB Sustainability of conventional agriculture is based upon a high input of agrochemicals, such as phosphate fertilizers. Conventional inorganic phosphorus fertilizers may cause an inadvertent addition of heavy metals, which are contained as impurities. Fertilizers commonly used in Argentina were analyzed to determine concentrations of chromium, cadmium, copper, zinc, nickel and lead. Rock phosphate contained the highest levels of cadmium and zinc, chromium was enhanced in diammonium phosphate and copper and lead were high in one superphosphate sample. Urea-phosphate contained the lowest levels of heavy metals. Concentrations of heavy metals varied considerably and the levels of Cd and ph in some analyzed materials were significant relative to those naturally present in soils. Continuous fertilization of soils could increase the heavy metal contents exceeding natural abundances in soils, and transfer of these metals to the human food chain must not be overlooked.

TI Values, performance and subjective well-being in the sustainability
   movement: An elaboration of multiple discrepancies theory
SO SOCIAL INDICATORS RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID ALTERNATIVE-TECHNOLOGY; QUALITY; LIFE
AB Building on multiple discrepancies theory (MDT) as developed by Michalos (1985, 1991), the present study seeks to extend the application of MDT by operationalizing multiple discrepancies or ''gaps'' between values and performance for a representative group from the sustainability movement (back-to-the-landers), and then comparing the ability of the operationalized discrepancies, in competition with a series of demographic and process variables, to explain variance in a set of subjective well-being (SWB) measures. In the analysis of variance (ANOVA) and zero-order correlation equations, the value-performance discrepancies demonstrate consistent statistically significant relationships with the SWB measures. In the multiple regression models, however, the gap variables are not as prominent as other process variables, although they do add variance to SWB, validating the general utility of MDT. It appears, though, that there are other dimensions, many of them specific to the back-to-the-land way of life, that can compensate for the discrepancies between values and performance.

AB The study investigated whether community care is sustainable by examining the levels of stress and burnout that affect community mental health staff. Six teams from around Great Britain were chosen to take part, representing a number of different facets of care: the type of community model, whether it uas in an inner city or suburban area and whether the team had been part of a scientific evaluation of care, in which case it may have contained more experienced and more highly trained staff. The results indicated that community care staff experienced high levels of burnout as a result of the work stressors. These levels were higher than those found in any published study of health professionals within hospitals, but are similar to those found in community teams recently. There was no evidence that any particular model of community care produced less burnout, but working in an inner city did seem to produce the highest levels. There did seem to be some benefit from a moderate staff turnover within teams. These results mirror those of other recent studies. Models of community care can only be sustained by reducing their toxicity on the staff who have to make them work. Therefore. levels of stress and burnout should be included in any evaluation of the cost-effectiveness of service models. The alleviation of these high levels through individual and organisational interventions should now be a high priority.

SO SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Population size estimates and capture rates by various fishing techniques of mature estuarine bream, Acanthopagrus berda, were determined in the Kosi lakes system using mark-recapture methods. The total population size of mature A. berda was estimated to be 45 257 (95% confidence interval: 31 589-74 429) based on fish recaptured in fish traps and 56 112 (95% confidence interval: 25 505-374 080) using recaptures from recreational anglers. Fish traps were estimated to catch about 5% of the mature population of A. berda annually, while recreational rod and line angling and traditional spearfishing accounted for about 1% and 0.2% of the mature population respectively. Limited mark-recapture data for other species of fishes in the lakes yielded annual capture rates by fish traps ranging from 2.4% to 5.8%. These levels of fishing appear low enough to be sustainable, but evidence from a long-term monitoring programme indicates an increase in overall fishing effort in the Kosi lakes between 1984 and 1996 and a three-fold increase in the proportion of the A. berda population caught annually. However, there is no evidence from available catch per unit effort (CPUE) data that current levels of harvesting of A. berda are unsustainable. This needs to be confirmed through modelling of the A. berda stocks and continued monitoring of CPUE in all components of the Kosi lakes fishery. In the meantime, an increase in fishing effort directed at this species is not recommended.

It is argued that a firm's sustainable advantage depends on its ability to manage the instructional context of its resource decisions. A firm's institutional context includes its internal culture as well as broader influences from the state, society, and interfirm relations that define socially acceptable economic behavior. A process model of firm heterogeneity is proposed that combines the insights of a resource-based view,with the institutional perspective from organization theory. Nonnative rationality institutional isolating mechanisms, and institutional sources of firm homogeneity are proposed as determinants of rent potential that complement and extend resource-based explanations of firm variation and sustainable competitive advantage. The article suggests that both resource capital and institutional capital are indispensable to sustainable competitive advantage. (C) 1997 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Introduced pasture plants are a serious threat to Australia's ecosystems. Five of Australia's worst environmental weeds are tropical pasture grasses and 2 are shrubs introduced for shade and fodder. The paper documents cases where exotic tropical grasses and legumes introduced for sowing pastures have invaded national parks and natural ecosystems. The effects of vigorous exotic grasses in altering the fire regime, thus adversely affecting biodiversity, are discussed. Exotic grasses used in ponded pastures eliminate habitat for native fish. Woody legumes and twining legumes also pose a grave threat.
   Sown pastures frequently decline or fail because of run-down, marginal land, pest attack, or overgrazing. In these situations, new exotic pasture plants are wrongly promoted as the solution. Lower grazing pressures are likely to be more sustainable in the longer term.
   Because of the deleterious effects of exotic grasses, and twining and woody legumes, there is no justification for further introduction. Research should be directed towards developing native legumes and grasses, as a resource for the grazing industries.

AB Land, property and construction are reckoned to account for around 20 per cent of the gross domestic product of many nations. The relationship between people and the land is complex and differs between nations depending on their history, culture and legal system. Many countries, especially those in transition from command to market-driven economies, are re-engineering their cadastral and land registration systems in order to provide cheaper, faster and more secure ways of transacting land. This paper focuses on the importance of land tenure arrangements and the need to manage information about land and property in support of land markets and sustainable development.

AB Too often a sustainable landfill is described in terms of operational technique (e.g. bioreactor landfill or repository for pretreated waste) rather than the more appropriate goal of managing a landfill such that the environmental risk is acceptable. The technique that achieves the lowest risk landfill will vary according to a number of factors including the waste composition, climate and local geology/hydrogeology, and will vary from country to country, region to region, and site to site. A truly sustainable landfill is one in which the waste materials are safely assimilated into the surrounding environment, whether or not they have been treated by biological, thermal or other processes, and which manages gas-related problems so as to minimize the environmental impact. This is more likely to be achieved in containment landfills, but recognizing that liner failure will occur ultimately, and that in the long term, the escape of waste materials and their products of degradation is inevitable. Appropriate site selection, design and management is crucial to the attainment of more sustainable waste management. (C) 1997 ISWA.

TI An analytical method for the analysis of pumping tests in fractured

SO WATER SA
LA English
DT Article
AB The formula of Cooper-Jacob has been applied to constant-rate pumping tests in fractured aquifers, by considering the fracture and matrix as two separate systems. Some time-drawdown curves which are obtained from the constant-discharge pumping tests display two distinct slopes. The slopes are representative of the fracture and the aquifer matrix systems. The fracture has a high transmissivity and low storativity and the matrix has a low transmissivity and a high storativity. The analytical method considers flow to take place firstly from the fracture flow equations, the fracture flow velocity and also the distance to the boundary are determined. A pumping test was generated with a finite difference numerical model. Boundaries and a fracture were included in the model with hydraulic parameters assigned to the model. The method is in the form pf a computer (Fortran) program called FTA (Fracture Test Analysis) and it can be used to analyse pumping tests in fractured aquifers. It also yields the distance to the boundary which influences the sustainability of the aquifer. By determining more reliable aquifer parameters from pumping tests, improved recommendations can be made concerning sustainable pumping rates for fractured aquifers.

AB This paper describes the spawning and larval rearing of a new species of flounder (Paralichthys woolmani) and Pacific yellowtail (Seriola mazatlana) for aquaculture in Ecuador, Experimental production of these species has been conducted for the first time from eggs in captivity. Broodstock flounder were conditioned to spawn through temperature manipulation. Pacific yellowtail spawned under natural environmental conditions. Production of flounder fingerlings has been steady but survival rates remain low (3-8%). Survivals ranging from 0-70% were achieved throughout larval rearing of Seriola, however, high mortalities caused by diseases, cannibalism and weaning onto artificial diets during and after metamorphosis reduced the average survival rates through the juvenile stage to less than 1%. Epizootics of epitheliocystis and Vibrio alginolyticus have repeatedly occurred during the early developmental stages and remain the bottleneck to sustainable mass production of S. mazatlana and P. woolmani fingerlings.

TI Aspects of pension fund reform: Lessons for India
SO ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL WEEKLY

DT Article
AB Motivation for discussing an agenda for change in the Indian provident/pension fund system is provided by a compelling need to: (i) increase the number of people who have access to old-age financial security; (ii) enhance the flow of long-term institutional savings; and (iii) give a boost to the healthy development of financial markets. After analysing the present system in India, policy and regulatory changes needed to achieve the above goals on a long-term sustainable basis are put forward: The paper makes an attempt to draw some lessons from changes taking place in this sector elsewhere with the help of international case studies.

DE extensive aquaculture; sustainable production; Metapenaeus ensis
AB Extensive shrimp farming around Deep Bay, Hong Kong, began in the mid-1940's after the construction of intertidal ponds (gel wail among the coastal mangroves. The ponds are increasingly being seen as an example of how wetlands can be used sustainably since they are naturally stocked with shrimp postlarvae (e.g. Metapenaeus ensis) and young fish (e.g. Mugil cephalus) flushed into the ponds from Deep Bay. Once inside, these shrimps and fish feed on naturally occurring detritus on the pond floor.
   The only gel wai remaining in the Territory, are those at the WWF Hong Kong Mai Po Marshes Nature Reserve, adjacent to Deep Bay. Analysis of the shrimp production between 1990-1995 showed that there were two seasonal peaks, from April-June (Recruitment-I) and from July-October (Recruitment-II). The second peak was significantly lower than the first (p<0.001), especially from those gel wai in the southern part of the reserve which are much closer to a polluted river. The average harvest from each gel wai had also significantly declined from 40.9 +/- 6.0 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) in 1990 to 15.1 +/- 3.6 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) in 1995 (p<0.01). This decline can be attributed to the abundance of predatory fish in the gel wai, and increasing water pollution in Deep Bay which adversely affects the amount of shrimp larvae for stocking the gel wai, as well as the quality of water for flushing the ponds during the rearing and harvesting seasons. Despite this, those gel wai which are not-commercially viable can still support many non-commercial, more pollution tolerant fish and shrimp species. As a result, the management of these gel wai has been altered such that their objective is to provide feeding habitat for piscivorous waterbirds, which is also in line with the aims of the nature reserve.

AB The first signs of global warming caused by the greenhouse effect are now apparent. In the near future, a new evaluation of building materials in light of their ability to fulfill the requirements of sustainable development will be required In this paper; the energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions of concrete in residential buildings will be examined, taking into consideration production and operational phases, as well as traffic-induced energy consumption and emissions in residential areas. The massiveness of concrete buildings causes significant energy and emission savings compared to buildings comprised of lighter materials. This improves the ecological balance of concrete and lifts it to the group of building materials which burden the environment least.

AB Labiobaetis Novikova & Kluge is recorded from the Afrotropical Region for the first time. Six new species are described: Labiobaetis aquacidus (South Africa and Kenya), L. fabulosus (Madagascar), L. masai (Kenya), L. nadineae (South Africa), L. piscis (South Africa) and L. plumbago (Madagascar). Eight species previously assigned to the genera Baetis Leach, Cymulabaetis McCafferty & Waltz or Pseudocloeon Klapalek are transferred to Labiobaetis: L. balcanicus (Muller-Liebenau & Soldan), L. boussoulius (Gillies), L. cleopatrae (Thomas & Soldan), L. elouardi (Gillies), L. insolitus (Kopelke), L. kalengoensis (Kopelke), L. mtonis (Gillies), and L. vinosus (Barnard). The last species is redescribed from many additional specimens from South Africa. The wider range of morphological variation and gradation now apparent from the study of Afrotropical species of Labiobaetis indicates that Cymulabaetis is no longer sustainable as a separate genus and is placed as a junior synonym of Labiobaetis. Labiobaetis is distinguished within the Baetis complex of genera by the presence of a distomedial constriction or concavity on maxillary palp segment 2 in the larvae. Most species also possess a distolateral notch on the antennal scapes.

AB In 1972, four aerial censuses were carried out to assess the annual migration of zebra and wildebeest between Tarangire National Park and Simanjiro Plains. About 6000 zebra and 10,000 wildebeest were in the Plains in the middle of the rainy season, in April. During the dry season in August the animals were concentrated in the Park. The migration from the Park to the Plains started at beginning of the rains, in November/December. Recent censuses by Tanzania Wildlife Conservation Monitoring (TWCM, 1991, 1995) indicate that an estimated 23,000 zebra and 11,000 wildebeest migrate into the Park from Simanjiro and other wet season areas. Encroaching cultivation is a threat to the migration corridors and sustainability of the ecosystem. Providing benefits from wildlife to communities around the park would safeguard the future of the wildlife.

TI Using integrated coastal management and economics to conserve coastal
   tourism resources in Sri Lanka
SO AMBIO
LA English
DT Article
AB Coastal areas in the tropics are increasingly being developed for tourism. The combined natural features of beaches, coral reefs, warm marine waters and often a friendly culture of people, offer desirable destinations for many travelers. Although coastal tourism generates substantial economic benefits to local and national economies, the trade-off of such development is usually degradation of coastal environment. Poor environmental planning and lack of consideration of social-cultural issues are usual causes. This article examines the case of Hikkaduwa town and marine sanctuary, Sri Lanka, where tourism development has nearly ruined the coastal environment. Integrated coastal management in Sri Lanka through a community-based ''Special Area Management'' (SAM) plan for Hikkaduwa is examined. The ongoing and proposed management actions required to solve the environmental and social problems are analyzed in a cost-benefit framework. Financial, socialeconomic and environmental economic analyses for a 20-year project life all strongly support investment in SAM plan implementation. Untapped consumer surplus of visitors to Hikkaduwa has a large potential to contribute to costs. To ensure sustainability of tourism and resources, policies on how to finance plan implementation through profit sharing and locally collected fees are suggested.

AB The extended concept of soil quality which encompasses the attributes of environmental quality, food safety and quality, and human and animal health, in addition to soil productivity, has been widely accepted in the U.S.A. and abroad. In due course, the indicators of soil quality will need to be properly quantified and weighted according to site-specific conditions. Nevertheless, many scientists now tend to characterize the effects of soil degradative processes and soil conservation practices in terms of the time/rate of change in soil quality. It follows then that soil quality is the linkage or linchpin that bridges the strategies of alternative agriculture and the goals of sustainable agriculture. Thus, soil quality is the real "key" to a more sustainable agriculture. The concept of soil quality and these relationships should provide farmers, researchers, environmentalists, administrators and society as a whole with a better understanding of the challenges ahead, i.e., a) how to increase the productivity of arable/irrigated croplands while maintaining their sustainability and, b) how to increase the agricultural productivity of marginal/drylands without adversely affecting their potential sustainability. These are monumental tasks with problems that will not be resolved by the usual "standardized" research agenda. Rather, it will require new perspectives, innovative thinking, careful planning, and proper organization of both information and people. A vital requisite will be the involvement of scientists, extension agents and farmers working as a team to conduct the necessary research and development, technology transfer, on-farm testing, practical applications and adaptations that will meet these challenges.

ID SOIL
AB Most dryland fanning systems depend an tillage to grow crops. There is overwhelming evidence that repeated tillage is destroying the soil resource base and causing adverse environmental impacts. Tillage degrades the fertility of soils, causes air and water pollution, intensifies drought stress, destroys wildlife habitat, wastes fuel energy, and contributes to global warming. Consequently, most tillage-based systems in a dryland environment are not sustainable in the long-term. Today, dryland farmers are expected to produce food in ever greater quantities. This is becoming more difficult to do in view of declining soil quality, most of which is caused by soil tillage. It is becoming well documented scientifically that continuous no-till is the most effective, and practical approach for restoring and improving soil quality which is vital for sustained food production and a healthy environment. With this way of farming crop, residues or other organic amendments are retained on the soil surface and sowing/fertilizing is done with minimal soil disturbance. Research and farmers' experience indicate that with continuous no-till soil organic matter increases, soil structure improves, soil erosion is controlled, and in time crop yields increase substantially from what they were under tillage management, due to improved water relations and nutrient availability. These changes help to promote a cleaner and healthier environment and a more sustainable agriculture. A major obstacle that farmers often face with change to continuous no-till is overcoming yield-limiting factors during the transition years, that is, the first years of no-till following a history of intensive conventional tillage. These factors are often poorly understood and may be biologically-driven. Some of the problems involve residue management and increased weed and disease infestations. Farmer experience seems to indicate that many problems during the transition are temporary and become less important as the no-till system matures and equilibrates. The judicious use of crop rotations, cover crops and same soil disturbance may help reduce agronomic risks during the transition years. Farmers switching to continuous no-till must often seek new knowledge and develop new skills and techniques in order to achieve success with this new and different way of farming. Answers to their questions are urgently needed to provide strategies far promoting no-till as a way to enhance agricultural sustainability for future generations.

AB Dryland crop production is limited by precipitation and by soil factors such as texture and profile depth-that affect water storage capacity, pH, fertility, and salinity. When prevailing precipitation and soil factors are not in balance, crops will not yield at their potential and productivity may be impaired because soil degradation processes outweigh conservation practices. Sustainable crop production is possible through use of appropriate tillage and crop residue management practices. When adequate crop residues are available, conservation tillage is highly effective for conserving soil and water, achieving favorable crop yields, maintaining soil organic carbon contents, and soil and water quality. Other tillage methods along with appropriate conservation practices may be needed when crop residues are limited.

AB Managing nutrients in sustainable dryland farming systems requires evaluation of all factors limiting crop yield potential before plant nutrients are applied. In semi-arid areas, plant-available water is generally the major factor limiting yield, followed by N and P fertility. Adaption of minimum-till (MT) and no-till (NT) crop production systems increase soil storage of precipitation during non-crop periods, enabling more intensive cropping (2 crops in 3 years, 3 crops in 4 years, or annual cropping). As cropping intensity increases, so does the need far additional plant nutrients. Soil testing and plant analysis an essential tools for managing crop nutrients in environmentally sound, sustainable farming systems. Banding of nutrients close to the seed at planting will improve nutrient-use efficiency, particularly in MT and NT systems. precision fanning technologies are being developed to apply variable rates of fertilizer across fields rather than a single rate. In addition, seeding equipment is now available to allow one pass variable rate seeding and fertilization with fertilizer placed with the seed, between seed rows, or in bands near the seed. Reduced tillage systems, combined with more intensive cropping and variable rate fertilizer applications, are contributing to a more sustainable dryland fanning system hi semi-arid areas of the North American Great plains.

AB Rainfed agriculture in India is now facing a dilemma. Prime lands for rainfed agriculture, which are mostly with big fanners, are being gradually taken out of food crop cultivation for commercial cropping and even npn-arable systems. On the other hand, demand for food and oilseed crops are increasing due to rise in population. A large part of the available land with resource-poor farmers call ill-afford improved technologies. Thus higher demands mean cultivation of less suitable lands with lesser returns and greater risk of land degradation. To tackle the problem land users, at various levels, an to be made aware of the proper use of their land resources. Providing the alternative for sustainable land uses should follow proper evaluation of the land resources. The land users are to be encouraged to participate in the whole exercise of land inventorization and evolution of an action plan for proper use of their lands.

AB The adoption of dryland conservation technologies call significantly increase productivity and profitability in dryland agriculture. These technologies are based on maintaining surface residue cover and conserving as much water as possible for use by marketable crops. Dryland conservation technologies involve. (i) reducing soil water evaporation, (ii) eliminating water use by weeds, (iii) reducing water runoff (and soil erosion). (iv) increasing water infiltration: and (v) increasing snow catch. These critical components involve maintaining crop residues on the soil surface throughout the year. Although storing additional water is essential, changing the cropping system to utilize thr additional water will dramatically increase profitability. Therefore, producers must reduce tillage intensity to increase the quantity of soil water stored; however, to increase profitability produces must reduce their dependency on fallow by increasing their cropping intensity with alternative spring and summer row crops. As a result of interdisciplinary technology transfer programmes, the number of acres managed with conservation technologies has increased five-fold over the last five years. Producers understand that the dryland conservation technologies provide the greatest opportunity to achieve agricultural sustainability and profitability in the Great Plains.

AB For the last fifty years, the development of the U.S. transportation system has focused on providing for travel by private motor vehicle. Today, many people have no choice but to use a car for even the shortest trips. This transportation monoculture is the product of very deliberate policies, reflecting the special interests of the agencies and businesses directly connected to transportation. Serious problems are just around the curve, however, as we approach the limits of space, resources, and the carrying capacity of our environment. if we shift our view of transportation from a commodity to a cost, we will adopt different performance objectives, which will help lead us in the development of a more efficient, sustainable transportation system. This new system would feature greater attention to compact land use to make trips shorter and would make it both possible and Likely that many people would choose to walk or bicycle.

TI Two transport visions
SO ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB For all the economic and social benefits that it confers, the U.S. ground transportation system is not sustainable. This non-sustainability derives from both the fuel (oil) used to power transportation and from the ever increasing congestion that threatens ever worsening gridlock. Oil is a finite resource whose consumption leads to air pollution, the emission of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, and increasing threats to national security from growing imports. Congestion stems from the confluence of three factors: urban designs that are nearly totally dependent on motor vehicles; a growing population that is resulting in an increasing number of drivers; and a fixed supply of major urban roadways. A continuation of current trends would result in a society ever more locked in congestion and burdened with increased emissions of greenhouse gases and growing threats to national security. An alternative vision is offered, one where vehicles run off renewable energy sources and have no pollution or greenhouse gas emissions and where alternative transportation modes meet a much larger fraction of mobility needs.

TI The role of aquaculture in the sustainable development of irrigated
   farming systems in Punjab, Pakistan
SO AQUACULTURE RESEARCH
LA English

ID WATER
AB Natural resource managers in Pakistan today preside over a massive investment in water distribution infrastructure. An historical bias towards large-scale irrigation systems and a focus on water use for arable crop production appears to have contributed to an imbalance in food production in the region. This has resulted in the diminished supply and elevated price of fish and meat products, compounded by the disruption of natural fisheries. The situation is inconsistent with the regions food security needs and an important potential role exists for increased aquaculture development.
   Physically and organizationally, the integration of various fish production approaches into existing land and water use practices would also appear to be fundamentally feasible. There would appear to be strong economic justification for diversified water use involving fish production, especially small and medium-scale carp production in ponds, using ground water More broadly, within the context of the limited potential for further expansion of water resources, integrated aquaculture could contribute a vital productive element to various components of the water distribution and irrigated farming systems in the Punjab. These include: supply canals, provided diverse institutional and engineering objectives can be accomodated; groundwater (including potential application of saline groundwater); the farm sub-system, especially integrated rice and fish production options in conjunction with alternative pest control strategies such as Integrated Pest Management: and irrigation drainage systems, where water quality permits.
   Therefore urgent broad research objectives should include the definition, investigation and development of a series of distinct economic and environmentally sustainable approaches to integrated animal protein production from aquatic resources, presently managed principally for agricultural production. Approaches should involve both the replacement of lost fishery potential resulting from large-scale irrigation development and flood control management, and the development of net gains in aquatic output, and should focus particularly on efforts to promote recycling of agricultural residues, reduced pesticide use and efforts to make better use of scarce water resources through the integrated aquaculture production across a broad range of water resources.
   An increasing number of countries are approaching full development of their surface water resources, and like Pakistan many face the development of new management approaches to increase diversity and improve productivity in relation to water use. The lack of research in support of the development of integrated aquaculture, which lags many years behind comparable agricultural research, may be constraining the breadth of choice available to natural resource managers to meet their food security needs.

AB 1. British wetlands have a long history of over-exploitation, and there is evidence of a continuing decline. A significant body of obligations exists for the protection and wise use of British wetlands. However, there is an apparent failure of existing legislation and agreements adequately to protect the remaining resource.
   2. Better coordination of wetland policy is required to avert a continuing piecemeal loss of the nation's wetland resource. A consultation exercise has revealed support, and opportunities, for closer collaboration between a wide range of organizations with responsibility for, or which otherwise affect, wetlands. Then are many potential advantages to the development and acceptance of a single consistent definition and classification scheme, agreeable to all organizations with interests in wetlands.
   3. To provide adequate protection for wetlands, it is essential that the wide-ranging socioeconomic and ecological benefits they provide are accounted for in decision-making on all relevant development and land management issues, and are built into cost-benefit assessments and environmental statements prepared to support these decisions.
   4. The development of a clear national wetland strategy, in fulfilment of the Ramsar Convention as ratified by the UK in 1976, is a key step towards the goal of protecting the nation's wetland resource.
   5. The establishment of a National Wetland Forum, constituted by representatives from all wetland-related organizations and with support from Government, is of the highest priority if obligations to the wise and sustainable use of wetlands are to be met. Amongst the key tasks of this Forum would be the building of consensus on key issues, and assistance in the development of a national strategy for wetlands. (C) 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

   biodiversity; demersal resources; Senegal
ID SURPLUS
AB This paper presents a multispecific approach in order to assess the main demersal resources exploited off Senegal (West-Africa). In absence of reliable data on the actual fishing effort, two series of theoretical fishing effort are estimated, using available species abundance indices from 1971 to 1991. These two series correspond to different hypotheses concerning the trends of fleets' fishing, power: an optimistic one and a pessimistic one. For each species or taxa, a surplus production model is calculated with landings statistics and effort. The combining of monospecific models provides a multispecific diagnosis. The analysis is completed by the calculation of diversity indices of catches at the equilibrium level, expressed as a function of fishing effort. While considering the uncertainty around this first assessment, we show that Senegalese groundfish resource is globally full or over-exploited, according to the considered hypothesis. Under the pessimistic hypothesis, 9 among the 11 taxa of Pisces were clearly over-exploited, with fishing effort sometimes as much as twice or three times the effort of maximisation (f(MSY)). The situation is very critical for Arius sp., Epinephelus aeneus, Pagellus bellottii and Pomadasys sp. Using the multispecific approach, pessimistic diagnosis indicates a fishing effort nearly twice fMSY, with a Maximum Sustainable Yield at about 53 000 t for the 11 taxa together. Conversely, in 1991, octopus and cuttlefish appeared under-exploited. The diversity analysis shows that an increase in fishing effort would lead to a decrease in catch diversity. This result is interpreted as a sign of fragility in the exploited ecosystem.

AB Sustainable forest use is an integral part of Australia's recently adopted National Forest Policy; consequently, there is an urgent need for quantitative, ecologically based measures of sustainability. One process that may affect ecosystem sustainability is the removal of nutrients through forest harvesting and fire. This paper presents a model-based analysis of the combined consequences of harvesting and fire management practices for the nitrogen (N) budgets of managed forest ecosystems. The model, called N-BAL, evaluates the balance between N removals due to harvesting and fire (prescribed and regeneration burns), and N inputs (both natural and as added fertilizer), and leads to a criterion for the maintenance of site N reserves. That criterion can be used to estimate the accretion (or depletion) of site N over a single forest rotation, or to predict sustainable stem productivity for given N inputs and management practices. The analysis is applied to managed stands of karri (Eucalyptus diversicolor F. Muell.) in southwestern Australia to investigate whether natural N inputs are sufficient to maintain site N capital under current harvesting and fire practices. Model predictions for stands harvested at age 100 years with slash burns and regular prescribed burns range from a rotation-averaged depletion rate of 22 kg ha(-1) year(-1) to an annual accretion of 14 kg ha(-1) year(-1), depending on assumed N inputs and fire frequency and intensity. The mean annual N balance is highly sensitive to rates of natural N inputs, fire intensity and inter-fire period, and less sensitive to rotation length. These results are tentative and highlight the need for further research to improve estimates of several key model parameters and relationships.

AB The existing network of Protected Areas (PAs) in India is the major effort aimed at biodiversity conservation at the national level. The sustainability of PAs is heavily influenced by local people who are largely dependent on natural resources (fuel, fodder, minor forest products) for their livelihood. While all PAs are surrounded by historically resource-dependent communities, several of them have villages within their core areas, too. This has necessitated an alternative approach to natural resource management which aims to integrate the interests of conservation with those of the nearby resource dependent communities. The case of the Great Himalayan National Park illustrates and incorporates the lessons from Integrated Conservation and Development Projects (ICDPs) implemented elsewhere in the world.

AB Phenotypic diversity was studied among 13 Rhizobium strains selected from a total of 160 Rhizobium isolates from root nodules of Leucaena leucocephala. Two strains from Acacia saligna and two strains from Sesbania sesban plants were included in the examination for host range in the greenhouse. The Rhizobium sp. (Leucaena) strains were different from the reference strains and fell into three distinct groups for the utilization of 95 different carbon sources. Four of the best symbionts constituted a group, the majority of the strains fell into a second group, and strain DS 91 was the only member of the third group. Strains were effective symbionts for their original hosts. Nine strains were tolerant to elevated temperature (>42 degrees C), and three strains were resistant to high salinity (>3% NaCl). All Rhizobium sp. (Leucaena) strains effectively nodulated L. leucocephala and L. culensii, but nitrogen fixation was greater with L. leucocephala than with L. culensii. These strains failed to form effective symbioses with two other species of Leucaena (L. retusa and L. divursiflora) or with alfalfa, Medicago sativa. Rhizobium sp. (Leucaena) strains DS 65, DS 78, and DS 158 nodulated and efficiently fixed nitrogen with Phaseolus vulgaris, with DS 65 showing the highest symbiotic capability. Strain DS 65 also nodulated and fixed nitrogen with Glycine max and Vigna sinensis. Nodulation of Leucaena by two Bradyrhizobium sp. (Acacia) strains was sparse. Strain DS 101 from Sesbania formed nodules on Leucaena, whereas the other strain from Sesbania, DS 110, failed to nodulate this genus.

AB Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is today a widely accepted strategy to reduce over-dependence on chemical insecticides and their potentially negative environmental and economic effects. Biotechnology has considerable potential to contribute to sustainable biological elements of IPM. However, biotechnology development to date has been directed at more conventional models for pest control technologies.

TI The politics of sustainable development: Impediments to pollution
   prevention and policy integration in Canada
SO CANADIAN PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION-ADMINISTRATION PUBLIQUE DU CANADA
LA English
DT Article
ID GREAT-LAKES BASIN
AB Sustainable development has been widely hailed in Canadian environmental-policy circles, as has its related goals of promoting pollution prevention and integrating policy across sectoral, jurisdictional, and medium (e.g., air, water, land) boundaries. But such broad support has generally not served to translate sustainability into concrete policy initiatives at the federal or provincial levels. Indeed, most Canadian efforts to foster sustainability appear to be largely symbolic in nature, leaving the bulk of environmental regulatory functions highly fragmented by medium and oriented towards pollution control. In comparison with the United States, it remains much more difficult to discern prevention and integration principles being put into practice in Canada in many important areas of environmental policy. The decentralization of policy-making and the lack of policy entrepreneurship within environment ministries in Canada appear to contribute to this comparatively slower response to the challenge of sustainability.

AB Co-morbid alcohol-related disorders and anxiety disorders have been found to occur in alcohol treatment populations, anxiety treatment populations and the general community. People suffering from co-occurring alcohol-related and anxiety disorders are more prone to relapse to alcohol abuse, and more likely to re-enter the treatment system for either disorder than sufferers of either disorder without a co-morbid disorder. To review the current state of the management of this disorder, evidence of the prevalence of this co-morbid condition in clinical and community populations is examined, then the theoretical mechanisms that might explain this connection are reviewed. A comparison of the few treatment studies of co-morbid alcohol and anxiety disorders shows a limited number of pharmacological treatment trials and no psychotherapy outcome trials. This review shows that it is no longer sustainable to conceptualize co-morbidity of alcohol and anxiety disorders as a unitary concept, i.e. lumping alcohol-related and anxiety disorders as one global condition, but as separate distinct combinations of particular anxiety disorders, e.g. alcohol dependence and panic disorder, alcohol dependence and generalized anxiety disorder. The recommended treatment approach, supported by the evidence, is to offer separate and parallel therapy fbr the alcohol-related and anxiety disorder, until empirical evidence from treatment outcome studies suggest otherwise. There is an urgent need to conduct treatment outcome research for the subtypes of co-morbid alcohol and anxiety disorders.

AB Ecological critics of economics have argued for over one hundred years that economists should study the flow of energy and materials in the economy. The services nature offers to the human economy cannot be adequately valued in the accounting system of neoclassical environmental and resource economics. Today's ecological economics does not only critizice; it also tries to provide physical indicators in order to judge whether the economy is ecologically sustainable. Beyond its decisive role in strengthening such ecological economics, Georgescu-Roegen's work currently still holds sway in two additional fields: consumption theory (as analysed by Gowdy, 1993); and agrarian economics. Are there relations between such fields of study and ecological economics? In this article, I shall first focus on the agrarian question, and then on intra-and inter-generational ecological distribution. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB The context of the concept of weak sustainability is examined using a three-tier hierarchy of value. We argue that weak sustainability is relevant only in the context of marker exchange at a particular point in time. It offers an inadequate guide to the sustainability of social institutions and of the natural world. On the other hand, Georgescu-Roegen's concept of a viable technology recognizes that the integrity of the social and environmental systems surrounding market activity must be maintained if the human species is to persist through time. The concept of viability recognizes that market activity depends not only upon the sustaining functions of the environment but also upon the social sustaining functions of human institutions.

ID ENERGY ANALYSIS
AB This paper provides a reference set of indices based on emergy, for the evaluation of ecotechnological processes and whole economies. Indices of emergy yield ratio (EYR), environmental loading ratio (ELR), and emergy investment ratio (EIR), among others, are stressed, and a new index the emergy sustainability index (ESI) is defined. The emergy indices for a given system are shown to be functions of renewable, nonrenewable and purchased emergy inflows. Indices are given for several ecological engineering activities including oil spill restoration, land reclamation and wastewater recycle through wetlands, several production systems, and several national economies to demonstrate their usefulness. Ecological engineering involves both natural and engineered systems and the flows of renewable and nonrenewable energy, the appropriate amounts of which are important to determine if they are to result in sustainable use of resources. The sustainability index can be used to evaluate appropriate nonrenewable investments in eco-technology to maximize their performance. Sustainability of economies is shown to be a function of the net yield of the economy and its 'load' on the environment. The trends of these indices can be monitored over time and provide useful information about the dynamics of economic systems within the carrying capacity of the environment in which they develop. When a particular sector or production process is focused on, instead of a national economy, emergy based indices can provide insights into the thermodynamic efficiency of the process, the quality of its output, and the interaction between the process and its surrounding environment.

AB The Energy Saving Trust was set up by the last Conservative Government to run major programmes of investment in energy efficiency, to help meet the UK Government's targets to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, The Government was relying on the regulators OFGAS and OFFER to raise the funding required from gas and electricity consumers required rather than providing it from taxation, The regulators, however, felt that they were being expected to introduce taxes by the back door and refused to approve funds on the scale required, The Government's failure to resolve this problem suggests that competition was a more important goal of energy policy than the achievement of sustainable development, despite Government statements that they were both important, However, changes in power generation mean that the UK will meet its year 2000 carbon saving target without the Trust. This article explores the development of the Energy Saving Trust and the tensions between the roles of the regulators, OFGAS and OFFER, the Government and Parliament, in the period from 1992 to 1996, The article is based on research undertaken by the author for CSERGE, University of Norwich (Working Paper GEC 95-35), updated to reflect recent developments.

AB By the mid-1970s it had become clear over much of the advanced capitalist world that rapid economic growth, profitable production, rising material living standards, and full employment had ceased to be simultaneously attainable objectives. Moreover, it was also clear that the mass economy had grave environmental impacts. We begin this paper by briefly considering this transition before going on to examine the nature of the contemporary unemployment problem and to evaluate current approaches to job creation. We go on to explore an alternative approach based upon a transition to a different development trajectory, to a more sustainable regime of accumulation and enabling a eco-Keynesian mode or regulation, that simultaneously addresses issues of job creation and environmental valorisation. The appropriate territorial basis of regulation within Europe is then discussed. Last, some conclusions are drawn and the sustainability of the alternative approach is discussed.

ID IMPACT; STOVES
AB There is increasing international concern about the environmental impacts of refugees on host areas, with governments calling for compensation for environmental damage, particularly concerning the loss of woodland resources as a result of demand for wood for fuel. In addition to an obvious increase in the population of host areas, concern about refugees' woodfuel-use centres on the notion that they are 'exceptional resource degraders'. Since they view their stay as temporary, it is argued, they therefore do not have any incentive to use resources in a way that is sustainable in the long-term. This study examined refugee migration to the middle valley of the Senegal River, and compared woodfuel use by refugee and local populations. Drawing on a household survey and direct measurement of woodfuel use, little or no evidence is found to support the expectation that refugees use more wood for fuel than local people, or that they are more destructive in their collection or use of wood. This is important since it suggests that policy measures developed to reduce what is perceived as excess demand by refugees, notably through the introduction of fuel-efficient stoves, are unlikely to be successful. Reforestation schemes have been relatively unsuccessful in addressing supply or demand for wood.

AB Sustainable development requires that population and consumption remain within the limits of carrying capacity, while preventing a decline in the carrying capacity of an area requires that productive systems implanted through development be sustainable. Zoning can be a valuable tool in influencing land-use decisions, but we cannot expect government decrees to be capable of causing the landscape to evolve toward the sustainable patterns which have been recommended through zoning. A prerequisite for influencing land-use change is understanding the social processes involved in land-use decisions, beginning with deforestation dynamics. Work to estimate carrying capacity needs to embrace the wide variety of production systems used and contemplated for Amazonia and to be able to interpret this information at scales ranging from local communities to the region as a whole. This will require not only studies of different land-use systems in rural areas, but also integration with studies of energy use and support limits of urban populations. Risks of environmental impacts must be quantified under different development scenarios, and limits of acceptable risk identified and integrated into analyses of carrying capacity.
   Tapping the value of environmental services of standing forest represents a promising means of sustaining Amazonia's population over the long term, but numerous obstacles exist. These include halting deforestation before opportunities are lost and supporting the population in non-damaging ways while the institutional groundwork is laid for using the environmental services involved. Research is needed to quantify the magnitude of services and the appropriate monetary value per unit of service. Diplomatic agreement must be reached on these values, which can be expected to be quite different from estimates of the 'true' values based on research. A series of social arrangements must be proposed and implemented if the value derived from environmental services is to fulfil its dual role of maintaining both the forest and the human population in Amazonia.

TI On the compatibility of sustainability and economic growth
SO ENVIRONMENTAL ETHICS
LA English
DT Article
AB It is generally assumed that sustainable development and economic growth are compatible objectives. Because this assumption has been left unspecified, the debate on sustainability and growth has remained vague and confusing. Attempts at specification not only involve clarification of the interrelation of the two concepts, but also, we argue, require a philosophical approach in which the concepts of sustainability and economic growth are analyzed in the context of our frame of reference. We suggest that if the notion of sustainability is to be taken seriously, the conflicting conceptual and normative orientations between the two concepts require the reconsideration of our frame of reference.

TI From the Mexican Chiapas crisis: A different perspective for
   environmental ethics
SO ENVIRONMENTAL ETHICS
LA English
DT Article
AB The social unrest in Chiapas, a southern Mexican state, revealed the complexity of cultural and natural issues behind the idealized Western version of indigenous ecological ethics and its apparently universal perspective. In accordance with the conventional interpretation of traditional native beliefs, they are often pictured as alternative perspectives arising from challenges to the scientific worldview. In this paper, I point toward a more comprehensive account of human-environmental relation rooted in the particular type of social and natural conditions. I also discuss changes of place, changes of identity related to changes of place, and respective changes in modes of environmental sustainability. I conclude that modernization endangers two fundamental ethical insights: ''openness'' to the environment and respect for nonhuman living beings.

AB The world's population continues to grow and to require more and more food. Attempts by modern high output agriculture to meet this need have led to serious environmental problems. A more sustainable balance is now required and is being sought in a variety of ways. Hydrogeologists should continue to highlight the threat posed by agriculture to groundwater, particularly since groundwater is a hidden resource and its degradation and rehabilitation often take place slowly. But the time has come for groundwater specialists to go further and become actively involved in helping to provide practical and sustainable solutions. The agriculture of the future requires a holistic approach which balances the essential economics of food production with equally valid environmental needs, including those of groundwater. Such an approach demands cross-sectoral collaboration involving multidisciplinary research and action within an integrated policy framework. This paper reviews the current groundwater/agriculture interface and some of the attempts being made to achieve a more truly sustainable agriculture with particular emphasis on European experience. It aims to stimulate greater interest and involvement by hydrogeologists in helping to bring about realistic solutions that will enable future generations to enjoy adequate good quality food and water.

AB Maryland, Virginia, and Pennsylvania, USA, have agreed to reduce nutrient loadings to Chesapeake Bay by 40% by the year 2000. This requires control of nonpoint sources of nutrients, much of which comes from agriculture. Riparian forest buffer systems (RFBS) provide effective control of nonpoint source (NPS) pollution in some types of agricultural watersheds. Control of NPS pollution is dependent on the type of pollutant and the hydrologic connection between pollution sources, the RFBS, and the stream. Water quality improvements are most likely in areas of where most of the excess precipitation moves across, in, or near the root zone of the RFBS. In areas such as the Inner Coastal Plain and Piedmont watersheds with thin soils, RFBS should retain 50%-90% of the total loading of nitrate in shallow groundwater, sediment in surface runoff, and total N in both surface runoff and groundwater. Retention of phosphorus is generally much less. In regions with deeper soils and/or greater regional groundwater recharge (such as parts of the Piedmont and the Valley and Ridge), RFBS water quality improvements are probably much less. The expected levels of pollutant control by RFBS are identified for each of nine physiographic provinces of the Chesapeake Bay Watershed. Issues related to of establishment, sustainability, and management are also discussed.

AB This study examines similarities and differences between organic and conventional farmers. We explore the factors that underlie farmers' conservation attitudes and behaviors, including demographic and farm characteristics, awareness of and concern for environmental problems associated with agriculture, economic orientation toward farming, and self-reported conservation practices. A series of intensive personal interviews was conducted with 25 farmers in Washtenaw County, Michigan, USA, using both qualitative and quantitative survey methods. The findings indicate that both groups or farmers share a concern for the economic risks associated with farming, although the organic farmers reported a significantly greater concern for long-term sustainability and a greater willingness to incur present risk to gain future benefits. Organic farmers expressed a greater awareness of and concern for environmental problems associated with agriculture. Organic farmers also scored significantly higher on a multifaceted measure of conservation practices, although both groups had a fairly high adoption rate. implications of these findings are discussed, relative to economic risks of farming, implications for new farmers, effectiveness of conservation education and government programs, and impact of farm size and crop diversity.

TI Theoretical feasibility for ecological biomass ash recirculation:
   Chemical equilibrium behavior of nutrient elements and heavy metals
   during combustion
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID WASTE INCINERATION
AB To obtain a sustainable increased use of the CO2-neutral biomass fuels, the nutrient elements in the ashes formed have to be recirculated back to the forest and farm lands. During their growth, plants accumulate significant amounts of heavy metals of anthropogenic origin, normally enriched in the ashes during the energy conversion processes. If some kind of heavy metal separation technique could be applied during or after the processes, a more ecologically safe ash fraction may be produced for the recirculation of the nutrients. In addition, contaminated soils could be efficiently cleaned by controlled cultivation and combustion of biomass fuels. Previous experimental results from full-scale combustion plants have indicated that a significant fraction of a heavy metal-free ash may be obtained at high temperatures due to the lower volatilization temperatures of these metals. In the present work, the theoretical feasibility of a proposed high-temperature cyclone separation technique was evaluated by means of chemical equilibrium model calculations. The equilibrium behavior of both nutrient elements (Ca, Mg, K, Na, P) and heavy metals (Cd, Cu, Cr, Pb, Ni, Zn, As, V) as functions of temperature was determined. The results indicate that Cd, Cu, Pb, and possibly As and Ct may be volatilized, and thus separated, through a hot cyclone (800-850 degrees C), still keeping all Ca, Mg, and P and 75% of K and Na in a condensed form in the cyclone ash.

AB The continued threat to the world's land resources is exacerbated by the protracted food crisis in sub-Saharan Africa. Per capita food production continues to decrease even though this region compares favorably with other tropical regions in terms of climate and soil resources. The main determinant of this situation is the widely recognized need for an enabling policy environment that favors smallholder rural development. However, there are two other key determinants to food security and environmental sustainability in Africa that have not received sufficient attention in the past and are the focus of this contribution: (1) the need to tackle soil fertility depletion as the fundamental biophysical constraint to food security and (2) the need for more intensive and diverse land use, based on the domestication of indigenous trees to produce high value products while increasing agroecosystem resilience. Approaches that include these three issues will transform smallholder farming in Africa into productive and sustainable enterprises and will contribute greatly to food security and environmental conservation, in a win-win situation.

AB This paper illustrates the basic ideas of good crop rotations, adequate crop husbandry and high resource-use efficiencies and some relevant ecological approaches. The use of special crops to prevent the need of high inputs of crop protectants or to reduce losses of nutrients at the level of the cropping system deserves special attention in research. Examples are given for the ecological control of soil-borne fungi, parasitic weeds, nitrogen loss and other sustainable techniques to increase the resource-use efficiency at the cropping system level.

AB A methodical way of prototyping integrated and ecological arable farming systems (I/EAFS) in interaction with pilot farms is presented. It concerns a comprehensive and consistent approach of 5 steps. Step 1 is establishing a hierarchy of objectives considering the shortcomings of current farming systems in the region. Step 2 is transforming the objectives in a set of multiobjective parameters, to quantify them and establishing a set of multi-objective farming methods to achieve them. Step 3 is designing a theoretical prototype by linking parameters to farming methods and designing the methods in this context until they are ready for initial testing. Step 4 is laying out the prototype on at least 10 pilot farms in appropriate variants and testing and improving the prototype (variants) until the objectives, as quantified in the set of parameters, have been achieved (after repeated layout). Step 5 is disseminating the prototype (variants) to other farms with gradual shift in supervision from researchers to extensionists. This methodical method is being elaborated and tested by a European network of more than 20 research teams, sponsored by the European Union (AIR-concerted action). The teams express their achievements in a consistent set of 6 parts of an identity card of their prototype. The 6 parts of the EAFS-prototype of the author's team are presented to illustrate the methodical approach. Part 6 presents the state of the art. it shows that the desired results are progressively being achieved, which may be considered as the best proof of the effectiveness of prototyping.

AB Prototypes of Integrated Farming Systems for arable farming are being developed in the Netherlands based on a coherent methodology elaborated in an European Union concerted action. The role of crop protection in Integrated systems is, additional to all other methods, to efficiently control the remaining harmful species, with minimal use of well selected pesticides. The overall aim of more sustainable fanning systems is to reduce the exposure of the environment to pesticides in order to prevent short-and long term effects on all species over all the biosphere. An innovative approach to quantify this exposure of the environment to pesticides, based on molecular-chemical properties of the pesticides, is presented. The results of prototyping on an experimental farm in the Netherlands shows that not only drastic reductions in pesticide use are possible but that subsequent careful selection of pesticides can also lead to minimal environmental impact.

AB Sustainable land use requires development of agricultural production systems that, in addition to economic objectives, contribute to objectives in areas such as environment, health and well-bring, rural scenery and nature. Since these objectives are at least partially conflicting, development of sustainable fanning systems is characterized by negotiation about acceptable compromises among objectives. Four phases can be distinguished in the course of farming systems development: diagnosis, design, testing and improvement, and dissemination. During the last decade an approach coined 'prototyping' has emerged as a promising method for empirical farming systems development in Western Europe. Limitations of the approach include: (1) the limited number of systems that can be evaluated, resulting in a lack of perspective on conflicts among objectives, and (2) the expertise-based nature of rules used during systems design which unduly narrows the range of available options and obscures understanding of systems behaviour. In the paper, explorative studies based on transparent models of agronomy and management are put forward to supplement empirical prototyping and to remedy its shortcomings. To illustrate the potential of model-based explorations, two case studies are presented. The first case study deals with diagnosis and design of wheat based rotations in the Paris Basin of France, aimed at alleviating tactical problems of poor resource-use efficiency within the constraints imposed by existing crop rotations. The second case study addresses design of sustainable bulb-based farming systems in the Netherlands with the purpose of investigating strategic options at crop rotation and farm level to resolve conflicts between economic and environmental objectives. In the discussion, methodological elements of model-based explorations and interaction with stakeholders are addressed, and opportunities for enhanced development of sustainable farming systems are identified.

AB According to the ITU-T Recommendation 1.371, the Generic Cell Rate Algorithm (GCRA) is used to define Peak Cell Rate for the ATM network. It is further applied by the ATM Forum to define Sustainable Cell Rate and Burst Tolerance so as to facilitate Usage Parameter Control and Network Parameter Control. To check the validity of a cell according to the declared traffic parameters, the enforcer must read the clock time when a cell arrives. However, the clock of the enforcer would roll over frequently and thus makes wrong judgment. On the other hand, for a shaper in a customer premise node to dispatch cells conforming to the declared parameters, the clock would also roll over and the cell would not be dispatched correctly. To overcome the problems introduced by clock roll-over, we propose two modified GCRAs for the enforcer and the shaper, respectively. According to the proposed algorithms, we design new architectures for multi-connection shapers and enforcers in which a cell's priority is also considered. We also prove that the proposed algorithms are justified for the proposed architectures.

ID MANAGEMENT; STRATEGY; SECTOR; CANADA
AB Historically British Columbia's forests were managed under the implicit assumption that virtually the whole forested land base would, one day, be available for timber production. The BC Forest Service and licencees incorporate non-timber values into timber production plans through a process of ''integrated resource management'' which attempts to consider wildlife, riparian habitat, recreation, water flows, grazing and other forest uses in each decision about each hectare where logging is to occur. Under this extensive form of management, silvicultural investments are low. This policy has clearly failed either to satisfy legitimate demands from the environmental community or to produce the predictably high levels of timber harvest needed to sustain the forest products industry and industry-dependent communities. The core problem is that, despite a vast forest estate in British Columbia, land has become scarce. It is therefore logical to substitute capital, labour and knowledge for land in forest production processes. Such a policy could lead to substantial higher, sustainable timber harvests as well as a system of parks that covers more than half the Province. Implementing such a policy requires a change in forest management approach to zone the landscape and manage each zone intensively for a specific purpose. For the bulk of commercial timber production, intensively managed plantations appear to represent the best technological option. New directions in British Columbia's forest policy - land-use zoning, a new forest practice code, and dedicated capital for silvicultural investments - generally move towards this objective, but implementation remains uncertain. Major impediments include dysfunctional forest tenure arrangements and a comparatively poor information base.

AB An ongoing, trinational project is providing the first environmentally sustainable economic development plan for the Ussuri River watershed (URW) in Far East Russia and northeast China. The URW is host to a unique mix of northern taiga and southern subtropical biota, and contains many endemic, relict, and highly threatened species of plants and animals. In Russia, severe monetary inflation and a shift to a market economy have left some aspects of forest biodiversity in jeopardy, particularly policing for wildlife poachers, regulating CITES (international wildlife trafficking) violations, ensuring long-term sustained production of timber and non-timber forest products, protecting unique habitats, and adequately staffing scientific reserves and funding needed research. In China, broad scale conversion of remaining wetlands to agriculture and rice paddies, and of diverse native forests to intensively managed, monocultural plantations, is helping to sustain the economy but is sacrificing biodiversity. A proposed sustainable land use plan has (1) mapped resource use areas, including both proposed and existing transborder nature areas, (2) encouraged foreign investment in both countries, and (3) encouraged sustainable development of natural resource markets that will be compatible with long-term conservation of biodiversity. A hallmark of this plan is integrating the needs of the people with the capacity of the land through both environmental protection and wise resource use.

AB Forest management policy in New South Wales, Australia, has been dramatically changing during the past two decades in response to public controversy and widening expectations of the values that the forest should provide to society. The nature of NSW forest management today is a reflection of the unique Australian forest ecology, the nature of the forest sector, and the emergence of conflict and polarized views on forest management in the past two decades. Recent efforts have made progress in resolving the forest debate. The key elements have included an expanded protected areas reserve system, expanded reliance on plantation forests for wood supply, increased wood security for native forest industries in return for a commitment to value-adding and the implementation of an ecologically sustainable forest management framework. Like other Australian States, NSW is currently negotiating Regional Forest Agreements with the Commonwealth Government that will set the stage for future directions in forest management.

AB Canada is an international leader in the methodology of traditional land use and occupancy mapping as a result of the negotiation process far settling comprehensive land claims in the North. Since the early 1980s this methodology has found increasing application in the Canadian mid-North, especially in the context of forest planning and management in the northern Alberta Forest Management Agreement (FMA) areas. The goals of traditional land use and occupancy mapping in these FMAs include collection and preservation of traditional environmental knowledge, integration of this knowledge into forest planning and management and, for the Aboriginal communities, active participation in decision-making processes in order to attain sustainable forest management. While the first goal is often met in mapping projects, goals two and three are proving harder to achieve because of conflicting government policy agendas, differing paradigms of community development in society at large, and the lack of recognition and legal protection for Treaty and Aboriginal rights.

AB Disconnected from the social and historical roots of technological progress, technology transfer is embraced on a global level as a tangible solution to the third-world development 'problem', Left under-scrutinized is the dehumanizing potential of using technological progress as a gauge for civilizational advancement. The increasing globalization of the link between progress and technology is demonstrated in the case of China, which has accelerated its modernization efforts since the late 1970s. This article examines the ideological influence of progress on third-world development planning and implementation, questioning the validity of accelerating modernization in the context of long-term sustainability, On one hand, alternative models are required for envisioning social and environmental sustainability; on the other hand, strategies for intervention are needed to overcome deep-seated ideological beliefs about progress, Education represents a key site for producing and shaping ideological beliefs, and a potential 'weak point' for intervention is suggested.

AB Given the rapid conversion of tropical forests to crop and pasture land, the economic constraints to widespread fertilizer use, and the potentially negative ecological impacts of fertilizer misuse, there is an urgent need to improve the management of organic inputs and soil organic matter (SOM) dynamics in tropical land-use systems. One desirable goal is the ability to be able to manipulate SOM dynamics via management practices so as to promote soil conservation, to ensure the sustainable productivity of agroecosystems, and to increase the capacity of tropical soils to act as a sink for, rather than a source of, atmospheric carbon. Soil organic matter dynamics are affected by management activities such as: (1) manipulation of the soil environment via tillage, mulching, and application of organic or inorganic fertilizers; (2) varying not only the quantity and quality of organic inputs, but also the placement and timing of application; and (3) manipulation of soil fauna. Although simulation models based on ecosystem concepts, such as Century, offer a dynamic conceptual framework to examine the effects of long-term management, the predictable management of SOM dynamics in tropical agroecosystems is constrained by the lack of appropriate methodologies to isolate SOM pools that are responsive to management.

ID CONSERVATION; UPLANDS; JAVA
AB It is argued in this paper that two fundamental economic processes prevent resource-poor farmers in tropical countries from managing soil carbon in a sustainable manner. The first process is related to the fact that soil carbon and tropical forests are part of the natural capital of these countries and of the world community. As a consequence, the interests of resource-poor farmers in tropical countries, of these countries themselves and of the world community conflict. This implies that levels of adoption of sustainable soil carbon management practices which are optimal from the perspective of resource-poor farmers are sub-optimal from a regional and global perspective.
   The second process regards the nature of sustainable soil management practices. These practices are investments in natural capital which bring about net benefits to farmers only after four to six years. Absolute poverty levels in tropical countries make it very difficult for farmers to undertake such investments. It follows that even perfectly informed and rational resource-poor farmers will not voluntarily adopt socially optimal levels of soil carbon management in tropical countries.
   Policy interventions are a means of ensuring that soil carbon is managed in such a socially optimal and sustainable fashion in these countries. Two principles are proposed for developing effective, equitable and appropriate policy options. The first is the beneficiary-compensates principle, which requires that society in tropical countries and in industrialized countries should compensate resource-poor farmers in tropical countries for adopting soil carbon management practices. The second principle is that international and national policy options need to be well articulated and that sets of complementary policies should be put in place for seater effectiveness. Policies alleviating rural poverty and pressures to deforest are as necessary as policies specifically targeted at soil carbon management.
   Finally, research priorities for soil and biological scientists so derived from the analysis. These priorities necessitate the creation of interdisciplinary teams of soil, biological and social scientists. This is perhaps an even greater challenge for the scientific community than the achievement of the research agenda itself. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

SO HABITAT INTERNATIONAL

DE land; planning; urban management; Nigeria
AB Rapid urban population expansion in the developing world has created the need for effective land management in urban areas. Effective urban land management is important because of its implication in social and economic development. Public intervention and control. of land markets is generally viewed as one of the best means of ensuring the effective management of land. In Nigeria, land was nationalized in 1978 as a means of improving equity in access to it and its management. Studies of the Kano metropolitan area, one of the largest metropolitan areas in the country, indicate that urban land management is characterized by a lack of effectiveness. This paper reviews the factors contributing to the current ineffectiveness in land management in the metropolitan area. In general, the paper notes the need to link recommendations of public ownership of land with requirements necessary for effective management and to contextual issues in the locality where the policy is to be implemented. The paper concludes by recommending that the Kano state government should consider re-evaluating the existing land use control regulations and procedures in the city with a view to introducing a more appropriate and sustainable control system. The paper also recommends that Nigeria should consider liberalizing its land markets as a means of improving land management effectiveness. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

TI Planning with PRA: HIV and STD in a Nepalese mountain community
SO HEALTH POLICY AND PLANNING
LA English
DT Article
AB The application of Participatory Rural Appraisal methods (PRA) to the topic of sexual health enabled us to explore key factors concerning local people's perceptions regarding HIV/AIDS and STDs and to plan collectively to address the emerging issues. Conducting the process in a gender sensitive way enabled people to feel safe enough to express their own opinions, and having gained confidence in their peer groups, to share ideas later with the whole community in a joint planning exercise. Nevertheless one group was identified as difficult to reach and whose needs could not be met in a group for reasons of confidentiality. While the methodology itself clearly has great potential in planning around specific health issues, there are, nevertheless, limitations. Although the approach and the tools used are simple and accessible, the skills needed to analyze the information are more complex and demanding. The training given did not manage to equip facilitators adequately with these analytical skills and in the future will be more experience based and geared towards developing analysis and the ability to formulate questions. In addition, since the project is not permanently resident in the area, intensive support within the District is necessary to increase the chances of sustainability.

DT Article
AB The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is undertaking a massive reorganization to transform itself into a more efficient, patient-focused healthcare system. It has developed a new strategy and structure. But if it is to achieve the rapid, sustainable transformation needed to succeed in today's environment, it must also change its culture. The rigid, functionally focused, command-and-control culture that has long been a hallmark of VA must be replaced by one that values speed, flexibility, and the processes for delivering high-quality, cost-effective patient care. Such a change will not come easily. In addition to the normal hurdles, several barriers are unique to VA. They include ingrained bureaucratic traditions and behaviors, constraints imposed by the federal government, close scrutiny by powerful service organizations, and a Civil Service employee base that makes the hiring, promoting, and removing of employees a slow, unwieldy, and procedurally complex exercise. In a climate that does not encourage change, successful transformation must be well orchestrated. To drive the change, the leadership must be mobilized as a team, new work processes must be developed, and a full range of human resource processes must be established.

   Jamaica
AB This article explores the challenges and opportunities for achieving environmentally sustainable development with the growth of tourism in Negril, Jamaica. In the absence of public policy for planned development, the community has experienced severe deterioration of its ecosystem. Fieldwork conducted in 1995 found the resident community and its advocacy NGOs mobilized to manage their natural resources supported by international funding for projects to protect the environment and build an infrastructure to sustain future growth. Hotel managers are increasingly reliant on ''environmentally concerned'' marketing strategies. Negril, Jamaica, as text, represents a microcosm where community activists seek to protect natural resources compromised by increased population pressure exacerbated by overdevelopment for tourism. For an environmentally sustainable development to occur, social, economic and ecological factors have to be accommodated simultaneously so all stakeholders can participate and prosper.

AB Sustainable development without regular delivery of sen ices from the ecological component of Earth's life support system is presently impossible. Dependable delivery of these services over large temporal and spatial spans requires healthy ecosystems with unimpaired integrity. However, the conditions required for sustainable use of the planet's ecological life support systems have not received the attention necessary. Ecological resources as commodities (e.g. fisheries, timber) have received some attention, but those services (e.g. atmospheric gas balance) perceived as beneficial to human society have not. For example, we neither know how many can be eliminated and still serve as a life support system nor how much fragmentation will impair adequate delivery of services. The purpose of this manuscript is to initiate a discussion on these topics.

AB In 1981, six oil producing countries from the Arabian Gulf States decided to form a union, now known as the Gulf Go-operation Council States (GCCS). The members of the council are Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar, United Arab Emirates and Sultanate of Oman. The main declared objective of the council was to maintain good cooperation ties between these states to achieve economic, social and environmental development. Massive oil revenues were spent on many development projects such as housing, water, health and sanitation. In consequence, the quality of life improved in comparison to the pre-ail era situation. However, the sharp decline in oil price exposed concealed problems. This paper attempts to investigate the dilemma of development in the GCCS and ways of achieving sustainable development in them.

AB An approach to the rehabilitation of degraded community lands built on people's perceptions and traditional knowledge was developed, implemented on a small scale (6 ha plot), and evaluated in terms of economic and ecological casts and benefits over a period of 5 years in a mid-altitude (1200 m) village of Garhwal Himalaya. Rehabilitation comprised establishment of water harvesting tanks, organic management of soil, agroforestry (native multipurpose trees + traditional crops), and decison making by the whole village community. Costs and benefits under irrigated and unirrigated conditions were compared. The total cost of establishing the irrigated agroforestry system was 1.23 fold that of the unirrigated one, whereas the total benefit was 2.09 fold. The average standing above-ground biomass of the 4 year-old plantation in the irrigated agroforestry system was 11.69 t/ha compared to 8.34 t/ha in the unirrigated system, Improvement in soil properties was more pronounced in the irrigated system than in the unirrigated one. Nutrient input, an input derived largely from forest biomass, in the unirrigated system was nearly 3 times higher than that in the irrigated system. It is concluded that, considering the local and national/regional/global interests in an integrated manner, agroforestry incorporating water management would be a more effective option for rehabilitating degraded community lands than the afforestation currently being attempted by the government in the mid-altitudes of Indian Himalaya.

ID SECTOR
AB The authors question Africa's ability to achieve sustainable development in view of the erosion of its institution building capacity, a problem compounded by the alarming rate of Africa's continuing marginalisation in the world economy. The situation has been provoked by inappropriate domestic policies which have not only compromised Africa's competitiveness, but also made it particularly vulnerable given the increasing globalisation of markets and factors of production. The benefits associated with effective global economic participation transcend direct financial gains and include technology transfers, technical and managerial skills transfers, and other skills transfers associated with the 'learning and doing' process. These benefits are instrumental in the development of the economic, administrative, legislative and social institutions that prescribe the organisational and managerial structure of an economy and define its capacity for sustainable growth. In Africa, the absence of such structures has undermined development efforts and created large impoverished populations. But poverty in living standards is not only prevalent, there is also the acute poverty in knowledge and skills which is so damaging to institution building capacity. The socio-economic impact is manifest in dilapidated infrastructure, decaying institutions, the exodus of the professional and managerial cadre, and the almost total disintegration of society. It is within this context that Africa's ability to evolve and effectively manage sustainable development policies is questioned. The study concludes that the continent's capacity to initiate sound environmental and sustainable development policies depends crucially on its ability to develop appropriate and functional institutions.

ID LAND-USE
AB Ecologically fragile landscapes of the Himalaya, particularly rainfed areas, hare been experiencing increased degradation of land and water, and loss of biodiversity. This study emphasizes the utility of micro-level planning on area-specific landuse for environmental management in the most populated mountain belt (between 1000-2400 m asl), commonly referred as the 'problem zone' in the central Himalayan region. Assessment of existing land-use practices, environmental problems, and evaluation of physical and cultural infrastructures were the foundation of the envisaged developmental model and action plan. Based an the primary information, and constant interaction between the scientists and farmers, an eca-friendly alternative model for sustainable and optimal utilization of land has been developed and demonstrated. The people's participation was considered an essential tool for successful implementation of the action plan, Consequently, subsequent actions and field work were carried out by villagers themselves with the encouragement and guidance of experts. People's perception about the entire programme has been satisfactory as shown by the adoption of technology packages which have been demonstrated on their land. The basic ethos has been the supplementation of the traditional knowledge base, not its replacement.

DE Barind Tract; Boro rice; chaunia system; cropping systems; fertilizer
   application; shallow tube-well irrigation; soil management
AB Following the introduction of shallow tube-well (STW) irrigation in the late 1970s, modern Boro rice cultivation was adopted very rapidly. Boro rice growth depends on irrigation and has made farmers more dependent on STW owners, who have taken the opportunity to develop a land tenancy known as chaunia, under which they rent rice lands and grow Boro rice on a tenancy basis, particularly during the dry season. Under this system, the STW-owner farmers tend to use more chemical fertilizers in terms of volume and kind, but neglect the application of organic manures. Among the chemical fertilizers, extreme use of urea is observed in the chaunia system. This pattern of fertilizer application induces a decrease in the yield of transplanted Aman rice (T.Aman) during the wet season. Farmers suggest that the T.Aman yield has decreased due to the deterioration of soil conditions. Nevertheless, most of them are compelled to follow the chaunia system due to the scattered distribution of paddy plots and the reluctance of STW owners to sell water. Considering the negative effects of chaunia on soil fertility, a few farmers recently began to offer organic manures to STW-owner farmers for application before the planting of Boro rice, because they could not apply sufficient manure during the wet season due to the problem of transportation. This modified pattern of farming management is expected to expand in the study village. The initiative of farmers in modifying farming practice is considered to be significant in order to increase sustainable crop productivity in the Barind Tract.

TI Sustainability of effluent irrigation schemes: Measurable definition
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING-ASCE
LA English
DT Article
ID AGRICULTURE
AB Traditionally water requirements and nutrient removal capacity by plants are considered as the main design criteria of effluent irrigation schemes. Environmental impacts of schemes on surface and groundwater pollution, which may be controlling factors in some circumstances, have not been considered in the design process. In this paper the implication of the sustainability for effluent irrigation schemes has been identified through investigating the pollutant fate. An index has been developed to measure the sustainability status, A dynamic simulation model of the soil-plant system was used to predict the pollutant export to surface runoff and ground water. Pollutant accumulation in the soil profile was also predicted by the model. The traditional design procedure has been extended using the sustainable index as a design criterion and the simulation model for data generation. The application. of sustainable concept and index was demonstrated through a test case, Ground-water pollution was found to bet the controlling factor instead of water requirement and nutrient removal capacity in this case.

ID PUNCTUATED EQUILIBRIUM
AB A transformation creates a sustainable metamorphosis from a vision that produces radical changes in an: organization's products/services, consumers/clients, market channels, skills, sources of margin, competitive advantage, and persona, integrating these changes with core competencies. This article discusses the nature and means of creating such a transformation. A synthesis of ideas drawn from several sources suggests that the forces producing disequilibrium, commitment, anti breakout must be understood and managed by a leader to transform an organization. Propositions consider the key features of a transformation, process types that can produce a transformation, and the stages and steps required to create a transformation.

AB Trifolium repens (white clover) stolons were inoculated with Ditylenchus dipsaci (stem nematode), and the development of resulting infestations was monitored. Nematodes initially remained confined to superficial locations, concentrating in petiole axils near inoculation points. They were able to migrate slowly from the initial inoculation points and infest adjacent axils, especially in regions near the stolen tip. As time progressed, in some axils, nematodes migrated through the stolen epidermis and colonized slowly expanding subepidermal pockets of host tissue (ca, 0.2-mm length of stolon/day). In these loci nematodes established exponentially increasing populations, but the rates of locus expansion remained constant, indicating that locus expansion was limited by unidentified host-dependent factors. As a result of increasing population pressure within subepidermal loci, J4 entered a ''diapause'' state and the rate of egg production by adults declined, thereby reducing rate of population growth to more sustainable levels. Typically, these populations peaked at ca. 10,000 individuals in ca. 160 days occupying S-cm lengths of stolen. Thereafter, heavily infested regions of stolons started to die, leading to the formation of longitudinal splits in their epidermis. In other axils, nematodes did not migrate into the stolons but remained confined to axils. Some of these populations increased a hundred-fold in 95 days, with population growth ending when petioles started to die. Host plant stolen morphology was affected only when subepidermal stolen populations developed high population levels (>100 nematodes) within close proximity (<2 cm) to active terminal meristems. This occurred either when axillary buds became active on previously infested nodes or when nematodes established endoparasitic populations at locations near the stolen tip during winter and spring, when the rate of stolen extension was limited by low light intensity. Affected stolen tips could ''escape'' from the influence of such infestations when light intensity and temperature increased. Nematode activity was limited by low temperature rather than light intensity. Global warming is likely to lead to greater damage to infested plants during the winter and early spring because the predicted milder winter temperatures will enhance nematode activity but not necessarily promote stolen growth.

AB The Beijing Platform for Action, a document adopted by nearly 190 participating governments at the Fourth World Conference on Women held in 1995 in Beijing, China, was analyzed for content related to food and nutrition. Words such as ''nutrition,'' ''food,'' and ''hunger'' were found in 6 of the 12 Platform sections on strategic objectives for the world's women. The Platform helps to demonstrate a universal recognition of nutritional concerns as part of necessary programs and actions for progress in girls' and women's health and development. A call to ''eliminate discrimination against girls in health and nutrition'' was specifically included as one of the Platform's main strategic objectives. Nutrition educators and others involved in nutrition, health, and sustainable development have an important role to play in monitoring progress toward the achievement of the Beijing Platform's goals.

TI Evaluating soil properties of CRP land using remote sensing and GIS in
   Finney County, Kansas
SO JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION
LA English
DT Article
AB The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) began in 1986 with the primary purpose of reducing soil erosion. It also war intended to help the development of sustainable agriculture and associated environmental harmony However, its effectiveness has been questioned because of the large rests and extensive staff required to conduct the program. The objectives of our study were to test procedures for integrating remote sensing and geographic information systems (GIS) techniques to evaluate the present CRP in terms of its main goal, and to give recommendations for the future of the program in Finney County, Kansas. Three seasonal Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) images were used to derive the land-use/land cover (LULC) map. This information was incorporated with spatial dimensions of soil surface horizon thickness, surface horizon texture, soil family, soil subgroup, and soil erodibility index (EI), all of which were extracted or calculated from the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) soil survey geographic (SSURGO) data base. With GIS techniques, calculation of EI was move efficient and the value was more accurate than that calculated by hand. We found the average EI of the county to be 20, with the highest EI of 77 in the southwest portion of the study area. CRP land had higher soil fertility and a lower EI than land currently used for farming; therefore, the CRP for this county did not necessarily include the lank most susceptible to erosion. We suggest continuing the CRP program in Finney County, because the soils are generally at serious risk of erosion. We also suggest modifying the eligibility rules of the program in order to target the most environmentally sensitive lands.

SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MOSQUITO CONTROL ASSOCIATION
LA English
DT Article
ID COMPLEX
AB A bioenvironmental model to control malaria at Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd. in Hardwar was developed by using existing resources to reduce mosquito breeding. The civil maintenance department carried out major source reduction work by filling pits, low lying areas, ditches, etc., with fly ash from a coal-fired power station, construction of stand posts and proper drainage, mosquito proofing of overhead tanks, and preventive maintenance of the water supply and the sewage system. The project staff has applied 1) expanded polystyrene beads to underground tanks, leaking sluice valve chambers, and blocked sewage manholes; 2) biolarvicides to water accumulated in factory scraps, blocked drains, and riverbed pools, and 3) larvivorous fish to storm water drains, effluent ponds, and drains for the effective control of mosquito breeding. Improved surveillance and treatment coupled with comprehensive developmental schemes were additional tools to gain community support. As a result of intervention measures, the vector density in the township was significantly lowered compared to that of a control area, and there was a drastic reduction in malaria incidence compared to that of the preintervention year: only 190 cases were recorded in 1995, compared to 3,049 cases in 1985. The study has shown that malaria control in an industrial township through an integrated control approach is practical, sustainable, and economically feasible and reduces insecticide pollution in the environment.

AB One of the antimicrobial alkoxysilanes, 3-(trimethoxysilyl) propyl dimethyl octadecyl ammonium chloride (TMSAC), was applied to the sol-gel reaction to prepare the antimicrobial wood-inorganic composites from tetraethoxysilane (TEOS). The obtained TMSAC-SiO2 composites revealed some antimicrobial activities, but the use of the property-enhancer, 2-heptadecafluorooctylethyltrimethoxysilane (HFOETMOS) in a small quantity could provide water-repellency to the composites which has, further, improved its activities against both white-rot and brown-rot fungi. In addition, after a prolonged soil burial test, TMSAC woods have lost antimicrobial properties, whereas the TMSAC-SiO2, particularly, HFOETMOS-(TMSAC-SiO2) composites could have its high activities maintained. Therefore, it may be concluded that HFOETMOS-(TMSAC-SiO2) and TMSAC-SiO2 composites can provide sustainably high antimicrobial properties in wood.

AB Anaerobic treatment and decomposition of organic matter (without the use of oxygen) is a very old technique. Since about 1970, the principle has also been used on a broader scale for the purification of wastewater. However, in the early days, the anaerobic technique was only used for treatment of wastewaters with a very high content of easily degradable organic substances. Consequently, the fist full-scale wastewater treatment plant was realized in the sugar industry. Later on, it became obvious that there were many more potential applications. Nowadays, thousands of full-scale anaerobic wastewater treatment plants are operational. They are used to treat wastewater produced in the agricultural industry and also in the chemical industry. Since 1985, there has also been a breakthrough in the area of purification of municipal wastewater. Successful plants are not only operational in tropical climates such as India, Colombia, and Brazil, but it has also proved to be possible to treat municipal wastewater successfully using anaerobic treatment in subtropical countries like Portugal. Anaerobic technology is used as it has benefits in comparison with other techniques, such as, for example, lower energy consumption, biogas production, production of less sewage sludge, lower space requirements, and lower overall costs. With respect to the future, it can be concluded that there is strong pressure to use anaerobic treatment on a much wider scale. There are still many areas where successful use might be possible. Examples of future application are treatment of industrial wastewaters that currently receive aerobic treatment. It is anticipated that anaerobic treatment, in part due to new technical modifications, will make a big jump ahead. New ideas and new applications have made anaerobic treatment into a competitive technology in new fields such as the chemical industry. It is therefore necessary to continue fundamental research on anaerobic treatment for a number of years. In the Netherlands, a foundation was established with the aim to provide financial support to research projects. The Netherlands Environmental Technology Foundation (NETFO) was initiated by a censortium consisting of institutes, consultants, and contractors. The NETFO objective is to enhance the international status of the Netherlands when it comes to the development of sustainable solutions to environmental problems.

AB A method for non-invasive, quantitative P-31 NMR spectroscopic investigation of mitochondrial function in human skeletal muscle in situ is described. High time resolution P-31 NMP measurements of phosphocreatine, inorganic phosphate and ATP resonances were conducted on human forearm flexor muscle during involuntary twitch contraction at eight different frequencies. Mitochondrial and glyco(geno)lytic ATP synthesis fluxes, and the cytosolic free energy of ATP hydrolysis (Delta G(p)) were calculated at incremental steady-states of energy balance. The covariation of mitochondrial ATP synthesis flux, J(p)(MOP), and Delta G(p) was quasilinear over the physiological range of free energy values. Curve fit analysis of the covariation yielded a maximal sustainable J(p)(MOP) of 0.24 +/- 0.06 mmol ATP l(-1) s(-1) and a midpoint potential, (Delta G(p))(0.5), of 58.1 +/- 1.2 kJ/mole in the muscle cells.

TI Saving salmon with fishwheels: A bioeconomic analysis
SO NATURAL RESOURCES JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB The restoration of depleted wild salmon stocks in the Northwestern United States could be advanced with the re-introduction of in-river fixed gear techniques such as fishwheels, which offer substantial economic, biological, and stock assessment advantages. A dynamic simulation model demonstrates that fish wheels could reduce costs and increase net economic benefits to commercial fishers by a factor of five, and that the potentially adverse income and employment consequences that often accompany policy or technological changes can be avoided with appropriate anti sequenced policy implementation. Indeed, the analysis demonstrates the feasibility of a transition path to sustainable salmon management that makes current commercial fishers better off economically, while at the same time restoring depleted wild salmon stocks. In addition, the reintroduction of fishwheels could help mitigate recent conflicts between the United States and Canada over salmon harvest allocations.

AB Today, agriculture remains a major agent of land transformation, the nature of which varies considerably between the developed and developing worlds. Of particular significance is the transformation of tropical forest lands into agricultural lands. This is causing extensive loss of biodiversity which means a loss of potential benefits in terms of `goods'. and possibly the impairment of ecosystem services. The latter has implications for global climatic change. Such trends will continue beyond the millennium as world population is set to increase from 5.7 x 10(9) now to 8.3 x 10(9) in 2025. Part 1 of this series -Temporal and spatial dimensions -appeared in Volume 26 No, 2.

AB We evaluated the analgesic efficacy of EMLA cream after repeated bone marrow aspirations or lumbar punctures (LPs) in children with cancer, and compared the ratings among patients, their parents, physicians, and nurses. Data from LPs were analyzed at the last procedure without EMLA (T1) and the first and last procedures with EMLA (T2 and T3). Friedman's nonparametric analysis of variance was used for statistical analysis. A total of 272 procedures in 29 children were analyzed. For 179 procedures without EMLA, physicians rated pain lower than other raters, and for the 93 with EMLA physicians rated pain less than the children. Children rated pain at T2 lower than at T1 or T3. Physicians rated pain at T2 less than at T3. Both children and physicians rated pain at T3 as not different from that at T1. No differences were noted at these time points for other raters in LP distress ratings, or in bone marrow aspiration pain or distress ratings. Thus EMLA was associated with decreased pain ratings for LPs, but this effect was not sustainable with repeated procedures. The cream alone should not be relied on to control pain of bone marrow aspiration or repeated LPs in children. Physicians underestimated pain, which may have implications for undertreatment in this patient population.

AB There is a growing tension between two apparently irreconcilable trends: (1) demographic projections that world population size will reach 10 to 11 billion by the middle of the next century; and (2) scientific estimates that the Earth's long-term sustainable carrying capacity (at an "adequate to comfortable" standard of living) may not be much greater than 2 to 3 billion. It is past time to develop internationally coordinated sociopolitical initiatives that go beyond slowing the growth or stabilizing global human numbers. After "inescapable realities" that humans must soon confront, and notwithstanding the considerable difficulties involved in establishing "global population optimums," I conclude with several suggestions how best to bring about a very significant reduction in global population over the next two to three centuries. These proposals are cautiously optimistic.

DT Article
AB In 1992, the scientific academies of Britain and the United States issued a joint statement on Population Growth, Resource Consumption and a Sustainable World (see PDR, June 1992). That document was followed up by a ''Science Summit'' on world population in New Delhi in 1993, resulting in a statement endorsed by 58 of the world's scientific academies (see PDR, March 1994). Continuing these initiatives, in June 1997 the Royal Society (the UK Academy of Science) and the US National Academy of Sciences issued yet another statement tinder the title Towards Sustainable Consumption. Its full text is reproduced below.
   Referring to views of unspecified provenance-perhaps also wishing to qualify some of the tone of the academies' own earlier declarations-the statement notes that ''It has often been assumed that population growth is the dominant problem we face.'' Put the statement asserts, what matters is not only population numbers but how ''poor or affluent'' people are: ''We must tackle population and consumption together.'' None of the recent series of five large UN conferences, the statement complains, has adequately addressed the issue of resource consumption. An informal network of the Science Academies of the world, the InterAcademy Panel on International Issues formed after the New Delhi meeting, is Maw examining that issue. Its work is to be culminated in a conference in the year 2000 and in ''publication of an agreed statement.''
   The only institutionally identified authorship of the statement sheds no light on how if was drafted. Unlike the Royal Society, the US National Academy has a social science component, including numerous individual social scientists, notably economists, and specialized panels on topics such as population and sustainability. The line of arguments offered by the statement its conceptual armamentarium, its seeming lack of grasp about the ''causes and dynamics of consumptive behaviour,'' and ifs awkwardly eclectic citations of statistics suggest that social scientists provided little or no input. The closing paragraph of the statement seems to imply that their absence will be corrected in the proposed program of work leading to the conference planned for the year 2000.

ID RAT; INDUCTION
AB We assessed changes in transcriptional activation of the inducible isoform of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in a model of macrophage dependent proliferative glomerulonephritis in the rat resembling human forms of rapidly progressive nephritis, By the use of a cDNA probe derived from rat glomerular RNA and an RNase protection assay, iNOS expression was assessed at early and tate stages of the disease and was correlated with the extent of macrophage infiltration, Prominent INOS expression occurred in isolated glomeruli 24 hr after onset of immune injury when marked glomerular infiltration by macrophages also occurred, Treatment of animals with immune injury with the arachidonic acid cyclooxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin, potentiated iNOS expression, iNOS expression was short-lived; it was markedly reduced on Day 2 of injury and undetectable on Days 4 and 10, despite sustained infiltration of glomeruli by macrophages. These observations suggest that in glomerular immune injury the enhanced expression of INOS is not sustainable possibly due to downregulatory factors generated in the course of injury.

AB In response to the progressive environmental deterioration, the Ecological Society of America has made a proposal, called ''Sustainable Biosphere Initiative'', to do research, teaching and decision making processes on biodiversity, global change and the effects of human activities on environment. The goal of appropriate environmental protection and welfare for mankind includes health and quality of life. Presently, Chile faces a number of environmental problems such as pollution, excessive urban growth, loss of agricultural areas, disposal of solid waste and species extinction. The lack of education and information in Chile, on these problems, is worrisome. The role of universities to overcome this deficit should be crucial in the future sustainable development of Chile.

TI Grassroot communities, land and environment in the Amazon region
SO SOCIAL COMPASS
LA French
DT Article
AB The mobilization of grassroots Catholic groups (base communities) in the Amazon region of Brazil provides a clear illustration of the influence of religion on social activism. This mobilization has emerged in response to land conflicts and environmental problems that have resulted from the policies of the military government that ruled Brazil from 1964 to 1985. The Roman Catholic Church has responded on both the grassroots and institutional levels to these problems, but not always in a consistent manner. The two case studies presented in this paper;show the relationship between base communities and rural activism as affected in different ways by patterns of ecclesiastical authority. The first example illustrates how inconsistencies in support from the Church hampered the effective mobilization of small farmers to resist the loss of their land to an aluminium refinery. The residents of the one rural village that successfully resisted expulsion from the land are suffering from the effects of air and water pollution caused by the aluminium plant and the threat of future health problems because of the proximity of the company's toxic waste dump. The second example presents a more positive outcome. It shows how a Church-supported organization of small farmers in the region of the Transamazonic Highway empowered its members to defend their land rights, to obtain schools and medical services, and to develop their own plans for sustainable agriculture.

AB The ranching sector is dynamic in the Brazilian Amazon and the approaches and environments used to raise cattle are diverse. Ranching occurs in natural grasslands at the mouth of the Amazon River, floodplains along the Amazon River, and interfluvial (nonflooded) lands where forest has been cut and replaced by pasture. We found that traditional extensive style approaches to ranching are lucrative in all three Amazonian settings. Moreover, returns on ranching investments improved when ranchers specialized in range fattening (upland areas) or calf production (natural grasslands). Returns on ranching also improved when weed-infested upland pastures were rejuvenated through tilling, planting better adapted forages, and fertilizing. The eastern Amazon offers several advantages over the traditional ranching regions in central and south Brazil. We discuss these advantages and concrete measures aimed at encouraging the intensification of ranching in Amazonia.

AB Microbes are the most diverse group of soil organisms, yet very little is known about them. Until recently, research has focused on those organisms that are culturable; however, a wealth of information is now being collected from both culturable and, as yet, unculturable organisms. Functions of the soil microbial population impact many soil processes and, therefore, productivity. Without microbes and their functions, there would be no other life forms. A greater understanding of soil microbial ecology can only benefit land management decisions. These organisms are the basis for transformations that enable life to continue; thus, knowledge of their interactions, roles, and functions are vital to our understanding of soils and sustainability. Our objective was to assess the areas of current soil microbiological research that will most influence future research. New research methods involving molecular techniques will extend our understanding of taxonomic and functional diversity in soil systems. The development of molecular techniques for microbial identification, coupled with traditional methods are promising areas for continued research. The application of this type of information is limitless, as are the avenues of exploration. Agricultural science, and its impact on agricultural and environmental policy, will benefit from this expanding knowledge base.

AB Soil degradation caused by excessive land use is presently one of the major constraints on sustainable agriculture in the mountainous area of northern Thailand. In order to obtain basic information about soil fertility problems involved in the transition from traditional shifting cultivation to more intensive upland farming, the dynamics of K, Mg, and Ca, and soil acidity in the farming systems of both Karen and Hmong/Thai peoples were investigated. In the fields that lay fallow for more than 5 y, the soils were highly acidic and poor in exchangeable bases, mainly due to the fact that the fallow vegetation rapidly absorbed inorganic bases (K, Mg, and Ca) in the soils. In the fields both under fallow and cropping within 3 y after the slash and burn practice, the high acidity observed in the soils at the fallow stage seemed to be alleviated by ash input with high alkalinity. The aboveground biomass ranged from 9 to 10 t ha(-1) in the 8 y fallow field and the sum of inorganic bases and alkalinity, which were expected to be added to the soils with ash input, ranged from 3 to 4 kmol(+) ha(-1) or kmol(-) ha(-1), respectively. In the fields under continuous cultivation for more than 4 y after the slash and burn practice, the subsoils showed a more acidic nature than in the fields immediately after burning. Judging from the high concentrations of inorganic bases in the soil solution from the subsoils, the decrease of the content of exchangeable bases and resulting soil acidification might have proceeded through leaching loss of these bases. Among the exchangeable bases in the soils, Ca and Mg were generally predominant and K occurred as trace. Comparison of the total contents of the bases with the contents of exchangeable ones showed that most of Ca occurred in an exchangeable form while most of K and Rig occurred in the nonexchangeable forms in the soils. Therefore, Ca was likely to be readily depleted along with soil acidification in continuous cultivation.

AB The acquisition of precise information on soil phosphate availability is a prerequisite to its sustainable management in agroecosystems. The objective of this study was to assess the exchangeability of phosphate in the particle-size fractions (2000-50, 50-2, and <2 mu m) of seven soil samples, Samples were completely dispersed with a Na-saturated cation-exchange resin, and phosphate exchangeability was assessed by the isotopic exchange kinetic method on each particle-size fraction and on the unfractionated samples, Isotopically exchangeable phosphate was then divided into five pools containing phosphate that is exchangeable within different time frames, In the 2000- to 50-mu m fraction, an average of 91.8% of the acid-extractable (1.0 M H2SO4) inorganic phosphate could not be exchanged within 1 yr while 5.5% of it was exchangeable within 1 min. These results are consistent with the presence in this fraction of slowly exchangeable phosphate in the form of condensed Ca phosphates and rapidly exchangeable phosphate associated with plant debris. In the <2-mu m fraction, a mean of 44.8% of the acid-extractable phosphate was exchangeable within 1 yr. This confirms that this fraction is the main source of phosphate available to plants, and the main sink for water-soluble phosphate, A comparison between the sum of the single pools assessed in fractions with the phosphate pools of unfractionated soils showed that, on dispersion, up to 30% of the acid-extractable phosphate was transferred from slowly to more rapidly exchangeable phosphate pools, This result strongly suggests that unfractionated soils contain phosphate that is physically protected from isotopic exchange, probably within water-stable aggregates.

AB Inclusion of pastures in a rotation may reverse the effects of conventional cropping and tillage on soil degradation. We hypothesized that crop-pasture rotations could be defined with a minimum pasture component and a maximum conventional cropping component to accomplish sustainable management. Soil organic carbon (SOC), light-fraction carbon (LFC), microbial biomass nitrogen (MBN), and aggregate stability index (ASI) mere measured in the surface 0 to 0.15 m of a fine, mixed, thermic Typic Argiudoll with 2% slope under a long-term crop rotation experiment at Balcarce, Argentina. Treatments were continuous cropping and crop-pasture (50:50 and 75:25) rotations, All seedbeds mere prepared with conventional tillage, All soil quality indicators decreased with cropping and increased with pasture. Data for each variable were fitted is an exponential model to describe their variation in time. Soil organic C decreased 4.4 g kg(-1) in 6 to 7 yr under cropping and rose to the original level (37.2 g kg(-1)) after 3 to 4 yr under pasture. Light-fraction C, MBN, and ASI fell 0.9 g kg(-1), 39.0 mg kg(-1), and 43.9, respectively (97-100% of the estimated decline), after 7 yr under cropping, while they recovered to the values at the beginning of the cropping period (1.8 g kg(-1) 99.5 mg kg(-1), and 76.7, respectively) in a few years under pasture. Rotations including a maximum of 7 yr of conventional cropping alternated with a minimum of 3 yr of pasture would maintain soil properties within acceptable limits and meet the goals of sustainable agriculture under conditions similar to this experiment.

AB To study the influence of different vegetation species and plant properties on the generation of surface runoff and soil erosion in south east Spain, a series of rainfall simulation experiments was conducted on small (c. 1.5 m(2)) plots. These were carried out in October 1993 and May 1994 on two sites close to Murcia. Six vegetation types were studied, with some at different stages of maturity, giving a total of nine vegetation treatments and two bare soil treatments. Four replicates of each treatment were exposed to a rainstorm of 120 mm/h for 15 minutes. The results of the experiments show that there are few significant differences in the ability of the vegetation types studied to control runoff or soil erosion. Of the plant properties considered, only plant canopy cover showed a significant relationship with soil loss and runoff with the greatest reduction in soil loss taking place at canopy covers greater than 30%. The implications of this research are that future efforts should be directed at developing ecological successions and revegetation methods which promote a substantial and sustainable canopy cover.

ID CAPE-PROVINCE; SOUTH-AFRICA; MANAGEMENT; ECOSYSTEM
AB The water resources of the Western Cape province, and the catchment areas that produce them need to be carefully managed if future demands far water are to be met. Good catchment management, in the form of programmes to control alien invasive plants, provides an additional means for preventing losses of water but needs to be justified financially. Previous programmes aimed at the control of alien plants have been curtailed due to a lack of funds in the recent past, as they were conducted felt reasons of nature, rather than water conservation. However, recent studies have highlighted the impacts of alien plants on water resources, and have forced planners to take these impacts into account, In this paper, we review the history of alien plant control programmes, and assess the costs (financial) and benefits (in the form of reduced losses of water from invaded catchments) that would arise from such control. We use the standard practice of discounting future costs and benefits arising from planned and existing water supply schemes to estimate the relative efficiency of the schemes. By modelling the spread and effects of alien plants on streamflow, we show that alien plant control if effective and efficient. In the case of the proposed Skuifraam scheme (the preferred next option to supply water to Cape Town), water can be delivered at a cost of 57 and 59 c kl(-1), respectively, with and without the management of alien plants, far example, indicating that such management is cost-effective. Clearing invasive plants from the existing Theewaterskloof catchment would deliver additional water at only 13.6% of the cost of delivery from the new Skuifraam scheme (unit reference values of 8 and 59 c kl(-1) respectively). The analyses also show that an early investment in clearing is more cost effective than a later investment, as costs increase and yields decrease the longer the catchment is left to become more invaded. Many other benefits, including avoiding serious impacts on biodiversity. catchment stability and fire management, and enhancing social upliftment, have nor been included in this assessment, and add to the argument for implementation of the programme for clearing invasive alien plants.

AB Planning for sustainable urban solid waste management (USWM) in developing countries has to address several interdependent issues such as public health, environment, present and future costs to society and the livelihood of the ''actors'' in the informal recycling sector, This article presents a system dynamics model which captures the dynamic nature of interactions among the various components of the USWM system in a typical metropolitan city in India. The model provides a platform for debate on the potential and systemic consequences of various structural and policy alternatives for sustainable USWM. (C) 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Using second-order systems theory, the concept of 'sustainability' shifts from a normative starting point to a probabilistic expectation that is open to investigation. While first-order systems can be considered as observable translations of input into output, second-order systems theory adds the perspective of evolution to networks of first-order systems. Complex and dynamic systems are not instructed by incoming signals, but disturbed. They are able to adapt the cycles of their behaviour. Consequently, second-order delineations are not 'given' but are continuously reconstructed. These systems have no 'natural' delineations, and their 'limits to growth' remain a provisional hypothesis. The likelihood of the various progressions can be specified only in terms of a model. Among other things, changes between technological trajectories within the current regime can be distinguished from the possible transition to a regime of sustainable technological developments.

AB This paper examines how governments in Asia are changing the way they regulate their domestic airline industries in response to rapid growth in demand. Typically, the national carrier has been responsible for fostering air travel, often in situations where surface transport systems are poorly developed. Air transport has been an integral part of national development policies and the national carrier has been given a degree of protection to allow it to subsidise services the government deems to be necessary. As governments allow new private sector airlines to introduce much needed capacity into the system, the regulatory system is placed under severe strain. Many of the Asian countries that have implemented a more liberal approach to airline competition have been forced to allow the new private sector airlines to operate international services, at least on a regional basis. In many cases the belief has been that higher yields in international markets will help to cross-subsidise domestic services. However, increasing integration of domestic and international airline markets has posed difficulties for regulators in more developed markets and it is unlikely that this approach is sustainable. At the same time, the pressure for multiple designation and the growth of regional, cross-border airline services is complementing pressure at the multilateral level to liberalise international aviation regulations within the Asia-Pacific region.

DT Article
AB Third-generation wireless digital communication systems, currently being developed, are intended to integrate all the existing wireless systems and cover a wide range of services, including voice, video and multimedia. A difficult problem towards this direction is the efficient use of the limited available bandwidth. Although considerable improvements have been made recently in transmitter and receiver technology, the capacity of the air interface is still considerably smaller compared to other media such as fiber optics. Accordingly, traffic congestion is an important problem, especially for bandwidth demanding applications (e. g., video), leading to poor quality-of-service (QoS). This paper presents an overload control method, for TDMA systems, to temporarily reduce the source rate requirements to a sustainable level, in order to avoid a sudden degradation in QoS. The control is activated when the aggregate rate crosses a predefined threshold that identifies congestion. To ensure fairness, the selection of the sources whose rate will be reduced is performed in cooperation with a priority-based scheduling technique. The performance of the system under the proposed method is analyzed and system parameter values are optimized. It is shown that the method attains considerable improvement in the loss probability performance.

ID SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB This article examines the links between development and the infinite, suggesting that the idea of sustainable development is simply a means of extending the idea of development indefinitely. Western society is viewed as operating under the ''prime symbol'' or ''imaginary social signification'' of infinity and infinite development. The article then proposes an interpretation of perception through the use of metaphor, arguing that metaphors shape interpretations of development, and that contemporary ecological projects such as sustainable development are largely metaphorical. The conclusions note that the mainstream concept of sustainable development is inherently conservative and therefore adds little to a clearer understanding of nature-society relations and development policy.

AB This article surveys the empirical record of grain marketing and pricing policy in Eastern and Southern Africa over 1930-95. The paper addresses five key issues with major implications for food policy throughout Africa: (a) why the anticipated supply response to market liberalization has not yet occurred; (b) why the common assumption of state taxation of farmers to support a cheap food policy does not apply in most of the countries in the region; (c) why the temporary successes of the state-led approach to stimulating smallholder grain production were unsustainable; (d) why the elimination of government food subsidies associated with market reform has not adversely affected consumers; and (e) why the fiscal cost of the marketing systems at least initially worsened rather than improved after the reforms were implemented in most countries. The key future challenges for marketing policy are how to develop coordinated and financially sustainable input, finance and commodity marketing systems for raising productivity growth in smallholder agriculture while overcoming inherited agricultural dualism, and how to mitigate the effects of food price instability in a cost-effective manner.

AB Twenty-three taxa of fish have been identified from the Prespa lakes. Eleven of these have been introduced or translocated, and 7 of the remaining 12 are endemic to the Prespa lakes. This high proportion of endemism requires confirmation because the systematic position of several of the species and subspecies remains uncertain. The absence of a predatory fish in Mikri Prespa, the occurrence of trout in Megali Prespa, the presence of eels in both lakes and the occurrence of many rheophilous fish species typifies the fish communities of these two lakes. Monitoring of the fish population in Mikri Prespa, from 1984 to 1994, showed apparent stability or a slight increase in catches during this period. Not all the introduced species have been able to establish populations and their impact on the indigenous populations is yet to be defined. A spectacular re-establishment of the carp population, following the crash of the stock of this species in the 1970s-1980s, was recorded in the spring of 1991. The past and present situation of the fisheries in lakes Mikri and Megali Prespa is described, and their productivity and yields are analysed. Particular attention is given to a traditional fishing method unique to the Prespa region: ''pelaizia'' fishing. The factors involved in the temporal trends in the fisheries are identified and analysed. Recommendations for the management of the fish populations and the fisheries are proposed, so that the sustainability of this resource and the survival of the endemic fish species can be ensured.

AB A stock assessment study of Modiolus metcalfei in Panguil Bay, Southern Philippines, was conducted to determine growth parameters of the species and the status of the fishery given the current harvesting efforts of this resource in the bay. Growth parameter estimates yielded mean K and L-infinity values of 2.04 year(-1) and 62.50 mm, respectively. The recruitment pattern appeared to be unimodal, with the peak occurring during the months of May-July. Spat settlement ratios for May and July were 1.6 and 2.0 spat per live adult mussel, respectively. Settling spat showed preference to attach onto the shells and exposed byssal threads of live adult mussels, Catch curve analysis showed total mortality (Z) value of 7.64 year(-1); fishing mortality (F) was 5.60 year(-1). Exploitation rate was 73% of total mortality, and was attributed to intensive mussel gathering by local fishermen. Fishing mortality shows an over-exploited stock that necessitates some management intervention to maintain the sustainability of the fishery resource. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB The aim of sustainable heavy-metal management in agro-ecosystems is to ensure that the soil continues to fulfil its function in agricultural production, in environmental processes such as the cycling of elements, and as a habitat of numerous organisms. Assessment of sustainability has to be carried out in time, since metal accumulation in soil is largely irreversible and may cause problems if certain concentration levels are exceeded. In this study, we provide a concept to assess the sustainability of current metal cycles in agro-ecosystems based on dynamic heavy-metal balances for the plough layer. After presenting some general aspects of dynamic metal balances, we introduce 'sustainability indices'. These characteristic numbers can be used as indicators for potentially adverse effects of current agricultural practices, since they account for (ecotoxicologically founded) soil quality standards and for quality standards for produce, groundwater and surface water. They can also be used to assess the effects of different management options that aim to prevent quality standards from being exceeded as they provide insight in the dynamics governing input-output relationships. This is illustrated with a case study on heavy-metal flows in different arable farming systems. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

TI Technical efficiency in paddy farms of Tamil Nadu: an analysis based on
   farm size and ecological zone
SO AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
LA English
DT Article
ID FRONTIER PRODUCTION FUNCTION
AB Despite the wider application of efficiency analysis in Indian agriculture, little has been done on the investigation of intra and interecological variations, size differences and their interactions. However, ecological issues have paramount implications for the low-input sustainable agricultural production. Furthermore, due to the various causes of efficiency, the age-old size-based debate on efficiency differences is not yet resolved. The present study examines the level of technical efficiency across ecological zones and farm size groups in paddy farms of the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu. The study showed that 90% of the variation in output among paddy (IR-20) farms in the state is due to differences in technical efficiency. Land, animal power and fertilisers have significant influence on the level of paddy production. Varying from 0.59 to 0.97, the mean technical efficiency was found to be 0.83. The use of F-test in two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and censored regression (Tobit model), with dummies for ecological zones, farm size groups and their interactions, has shown that, at mean level, the level of technical efficiency among paddy farms of the state differs significantly across agro-ecological zones and size groups as well. The study further indicated that small-sized paddy farms in zone II and medium-sized paddy farms in zone III are represented by ecologically size-biased production techniques; thus achieving higher technical efficiency.

TI Land speculation and intensification at the frontier: A seeming paradox
   in the Colombian savanna
SO AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
AB Frontier areas in Latin America have been characterized by land speculation, abandonment and exploitation, This paper analyzes a frontier cattle ranching area in the savanna where intensification has occurred in spite of land speculation, A whole-farm livestock production model is used to quantify the determinants of intensification. Results show that land speculation has simultaneously increased the profitability of cattle ranching, while slowing down intensification and impeding the adoption of sustainable practices. Intensification occurred because the production gains offered by improved pastures over native grasses were large enough to overcome the negative effect of land speculation on intensification. By contrast, in the Amazon, improved technologies have to overcome the high fertility of newly deforested land. Thus, technology, land speculation and characteristics of the resource base interact in a complex way to determine the speed and nature of intensification. (C) 1997 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB For sustainable sunflower production in semi-arid sub-tropical regions, it is essential to increase its water use efficiency. Field studies were conducted for three years on deep alluvial loamy sand (Typic Ustipsamment) and sandy loam (Typic Ustochrept) soils at Punjab Agricultural University, Ludhiana, India, to evaluate the interactive effects of three irrigation regimes (irrigation water to net open pan evaporation ratios, I-1, I-2, I-3) on sunflower yield in relation to tillage (conventional tillage, CT, and deep-tillage, DT) and mulching (no mulch, M-0, and residue mulch,
   Both deep tillage and mulch significantly increased crop yield irrespective of soil type and year. Increase in mean achene yield across soils during three years with DT over CT varied between 10 and 16% and that with mulch over no mulch by 8 to 17%.
   Deep tillage and/or mulching helped the crop in efficient utilization of water by increasing leaf area index (LAI) and the depth and density of rooting. Irrigation and tillage interacted for their effects on yield on loamy sand, as the crop responded to higher level of irrigation with CT than with DT. On loamy sand, mean achene yield increased with increase in water supply up to IW/PE = 1.5 in a dry year and upto IW/PE = 1.2 in relatively wetter years. On sandy loam, mean yield response to irrigations was observed upto IW/PE = 1.0 in all the three years.
   Regression analysis of relative yield against water supply during the three years on both the soils, showed that for 80% relative yield the crop required 105 cm water in CTM0, 90 cm in CTM or DTM0 and only 80 cm in DTM. The study suggests that deep tillage or straw mulch may be used to achieve higher water use efficiency in sunflower on coarse textured soils in semi-arid, sub-tropical regions.

AB Since 1967, exporting crude oil has been the leading hard-currency earner for Oman: similar to 9x10(5) barrels of crude oil per day being extracted in 1997. The total remaining oil reserves, which can be harnessed economically now, amount to approximately 5.2x10(9) barrels, but this commercially-available resource is expected to be depleted completely by the year 2015. The second most important source of energy in the country is natural gas. present economically-harnessable reserves are approximately 724x10(9) Nm(3). In 1994, the amount extracted was merely 2.4x10(9) Nm(3). This resource is expected to be exhausted by the year 2064. From 1990 to 1995, the Government-run electricity-generation power-capability rose from 1277 to 1642 MW: the peak demand has grown simultaneously by 59%. The total-power generation in 1995 was 6500 GWh, while the annual consumption was 6173 GWh; the domestic sector accounting for approximately 60% of the total consumption. The rate of energy consumption pattern is seasonal in nature, with the mid-summer electric demand being nearly triple that of mid-winter. Private cars accounted for 54% of the total number of vehicles in Oman in 1994, and this number is rising rapidly. The associated freedom of choice to use the private car in order to satisfy the desires for increased mobility and privacy will not be sustainable in the long term. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Symbiotic association between plant roots and certain fungi is referred to as mycorrhiza, Mycorrhizal fungi provide a greater absorptive surface than root hairs and thus help in the absorption of the relatively immobile ions in soil such as phosphate, copper and zinc. In addition, mycorrhizal plants have greater tolerance to toxic metals, to root pathogens, to drought, to high soil temperature, to adverse soil pH and to transplant shock. The two main types of mycorrhiza in tropical ecosystems are: (1) ectomycorrhiza and (2) arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM), Ectomycorrhizae mainly occur in tropical pines, Caesalpiniaceae, Dipterocarpaceae and Myrtaceae. AM occur in most of the agricultural and horticultural crops and several tropical tree species. Tropical cropping systems are established on areas previously occupied by species-rich forest ecosystems. This brings about a drastic change in the biodiversity of mycorrhizal fungi, Further it can be generalized that modern, high-input agricultural practices generally are detrimental to mycorrhizal fungi, while the low-input sustainable agriculture methods enhance the population of mycorrhizal fungi, More studies are needed to understand the role of mycorrhizal fungi in soil aggregation. Non-destructive methods have to be developed for studying mycorrhizal biodiversity in natural ecosystems. (C) 1997 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

TI The wood for the paper: Old-growth forest, hemp and environmental harm
SO AUSTRALIAN AND NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF CRIMINOLOGY

DT Article
AB This article examines the politico-legal construction of environmental harm. it does so by comparing and contrasting the production processes and legislation relating to the clearfelling of old-growth forest and harvesting of fibre hemp for paper products. It asks why it is lawful to engage in an activity which is ecologically harmful (ie clearfelling old-growth forest), and, conversely why it is illegal to engage in an activity which is ecologically benign (ie cultivating fibre hemp). Through an explication of the relative harm resulting from the processing of these resources, questions are raised as to the ecological utility of legislation that permits the destruction of a unique resource but prohibits the harvesting of a sustainable alternative. The article suggests, amongst other things, that criminologists need to make a clear analytical distinction between events termed 'environmental crime' and those which might correctly be termed 'serious instances of ecological destruction'. More generally, the paper attempts to isolate the different conceptions of environmental harm that emerge from the comparative study and proceeds to outline some of the more serious implications for present criminological approaches to the issue of environmental harm.

AB This paper reports research conducted as part of the Single-Sex Education Pilot Project (SSEPP) which was undertaken in 1993-1994 in Western Australia. The project involved the implementation of single-sex science and/or mathematics in ten coeducational secondary schools. Unlike previous similar initiatives, the SSEPP included professional development for the teachers involved and systematic monitoring. The paper presents an analysis of teachers' reactions to and perceptions of the SSEPP. It gives voice to teachers' views of the major issues which arose during the project, concerning outcomes for students, school organisation, teacher professional development, community response and sustainability of the change.

AB Quantifying seasonal dynamics of active soil C and N pools is important for understanding how production systems can be better managed to sustain long-term soil productivity especially in warm subhumid climates. Our objectives were to determine seasonal dynamics of inorganic soil N, potential C and N mineralization, soil microbial biomass C (SMBC), and the metabolic quotient of microbial biomass in continuous corn (Zea mays L.) under conventional (CT), moldboard (MB), chisel (CH), minimum tillage (MT), and no-tillage (NT) with low (45 kg N ha(-1)) and high (90 kg N ha(-1)) N fertilization. An Orelia sandy clay loam (fine-loamy, mixed, hyperthermic Typic Ochraqualf) in south Texas, United States, was sampled before corn planting in February, during pollination in May, and following harvest in July. Soil inorganic N, SMBC: and potential C and N mineralization were usually highest in soils under NT, whereas these characteristics were consistently lower throughout the growing season in soils receiving MB tillage. Nitrogen fertilization had little effect on soil inorganic N, SMBC, and potential C and N mineralization. The metabolic quotient of microbial biomass exhibited seasonal patterns inverse to that of SMBC. Seasonal changes in SMBC, inorganic N, and mineralizable C and N indicated the dependence of seasonal C and N dynamics on long-term substrate availability from crop residues. Long-term reduced tillage increased soil organic matter (SOM), SMBC, inorganic N, and labile C and N pools as compared with plowed systems and may be more sustainable over the long term. Seasonal changes in active soil C and N pools were affected more by tillage than by N fertilization in this subhumid climate.

AB A suction probe was developed to directly measure matric suction greater than 100 kPa. The suction probe contains a small volume of water, a nonthreaded, high-range pressure transducer, and a 15 bar (1 bar = 100 kPa) ceramic disk. Cyclic prepressurization up to 12 000 kPa was used to dissolve potential cavitation nuclei in the water in the suction probe to increase the sustainable tension of the water. Using a pressure-plate cell, the suction probe has been verified to be accurate and has a rapid response for pore-water pressures as low as -500 kPa. Measurements performed on various types of soils indicate that the suction probe is able to measure matric suction up to 1250 kPa with satisfactory accuracy. The filter-paper method and the thermal conductivity sensor generally gave lower values of matric suction than the suction probe, whereas the null-pressure plate gave higher values of matric suction than the suction probe. The suction probe appeared to be best suited for measuring suction in wet clayey-type soils. Some difficulties were encountered in measuring suction in soils with a low degree of saturation.

AB The paper asks whether recent debates in Britain concerning the compact city have fully explored the relevant issues, including crucial questions of the environmental benefits accruing to compaction, and its acceptability to local communities. Major doubts are raised about the economic, political and technical dimensions of compaction and particularly the unacceptability of higher densities to many urban residents.

DE historic cities; sustainability; planning
AB Policymakers and planners are now aware that historic cities require regulatory mechanisms if they are to maintain and enhance the fabric upon which their historicity and economic vitality is based, Tensions over land use, changes in the nature of local economies, and the continued consumption of historic assets place considerable pressures on those distinctive features that make historic cities attractive places in which to vacation, live, work and invest. Such pressures have brought into focus the extent to which sustainable development policies can contribute to the management of change in historic cities, This article explores some of the conceptual issues raised by the sustainability/historic city debate, and examines the degree to which sustainable development policy is emerging in historic cities.

TI Risk analysis of hunting of seal populations in the Baltic
SO CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID CONSERVATION
AB Vulnerabilities of grey seal (Halichoerus grypus) and ringed seal (Phoca hispida) populations in the Baltic Sea were evaluated for potentia opening of the populations for hunting. We used ecological risk analysis to assess the effects of environmental and demographic stochasticity and uncertain and partly missing population data on the modeled outcomes. The impact of different harvesting strategies on the long-term sustainability of seal populations was analyzed with four different models with increasing complexity and population detail. It appears the simpler the population model used, the more overconfident results it gave with regard to the hunting policy to be adopted. Therefore, it proves risky in population management decisions to rely on simplistic calculations based on growth rate and estimated population size alone. This is even more so if the population estimates have a wide error margin. Due to an unknown, but presumably positive number of seal kills in the Baltic at present, the sustainable harvest is likely to be close to zero for both seal species. Our risk analysis strongly suggests refraining from Baltic seal hunting now, with their current populations sizes, and in the future if the development of population numbers cannot be assessed accurately enough.

TI The sustainability of subsistence hunting in the neotropics
SO CONSERVATION BIOLOGY

ID PREY CHOICE; GAME
AB Hunting is an important component of native subsistence strategies in Amazonia. It is also a serious threat to biodiversity in some areas. We present data on the faunal harvests of two native Neotropical subsistence hunting peoples, Machiguenga bow-hunters and Piro shotgun hunters of Peru. The rate of annual harvest per square kilometer of catchment is estimated and compared to rates of sustainable harvest calculated by Robinson and Redford (1991). We used indicators of prey abundance to test for the depletion of species that hunters killed in numbers greater than what the model predicts to be sustainable. As predicted, we found the strongest evidence for local depletion of the large primates at the Piro site. The woolly monkey (Lagothrix lagothricha) harvest at the Machiguenga village and the deer (Mazama americana) and collared peccary (Tayassu tajacu) harvests at both sites were not predicted to be unsustainable and we found no evidence for depletion. Machiguenga bow hunters killed spider monkeys (Ateles paniscus) in quantities that were slightly above what the model predicted to be sustainable, yet we found no evidence for depletion. Differential species vulnerability, catchment size, and consumer population size could be important factors in determining sustainability.

DE crop protection; integrated pest management (IPM); synthetic pesticides;
   biological control; biotechnology; sustainable agriculture
AB As a new millennium approaches, crop protectionists might profitably reflect on the chemical era of the 20th century, and assess their future contribution to world food and fibre production. New synthetic pesticides are increasingly selective in action and continue to be a cost-effective and reliable resource to many growers when properly managed. Risks to users and the environment from some older products must be reduced further through statutory and voluntary means. Biotechnology will play an important role in pest control but genetically-modified crops are not a panacea for major problems. Various non-chemical approaches need to become more available and affordable through appropriate commercialisation and government policy directives, with priority given to those that are compatible with ecology-based IPM. Information technology will also have a major impact on pest management and the implementation of truly integrated crop production. Participative farmer training is recognised as a key requirement for change. There is an unhealthy polarisation of views between some protagonists on the chemical and biological approaches to crop protection, particularly in tropical regions. This has to be resolved by better cooperation and foresight across public and private sectors if sustainable farming is to be realised through a balanced 'basket of conventional and novel opportunities'. The extreme view of 'zero pesticide' IPM must be placed in the context of growers' different socio-economic needs, the demands of various customers and scientific evidence of the real risks from modern chemical use.

DE membranes; pretreatment; reverse osmosis
AB The shortage of fresh water supplies is one of the main threats to sustainable development. Membrane technologies such as reverse osmosis (RO) have been used for over twenty years to treat sea water (SWRO) and waste waters. The applications have been limited due to the sensitivity of RO membranes to fouling and the ability of conventional pretreatment technologies. Pretreatment represents a real problem in the SWRO process. It represents 22.97% of the total product water costs at the Doha Reverse Osmosis Plant producing 4546 m(3)/d [1]. The development of backwashing continuous microfiltration (CMF) membranes enables RO to desalinate variable feed waters including turbid waste waters. Completed projects include the desalination and reuse of brackish secondary sewage and eutrophic surface water for industry and irrigation. These installations have resulted in a 40% reduction in the sizing of the RO plant installed, a 60-90% reduction in chemical used and effluent costs for the conventional deionisers, as well as solving local environmental issues through the reduction in potable water use and waste discharge.

AB PCB concentrations in Great Lakes sport fishes continue to concern managers. Proposed reductions in consumption advisories, if adopted, would increase pressure to further reduce contaminant concentrations. However, management of Great Lakes pelagic food webs for minimum PCB concentrations and maximum sustainability represents a potential conflict. Here I use a detailed age-structured chinook salmon-alewife model to examine the potential for changes in stocking rates to further reduce contaminant concentrations in Lake Ontario's chinook salmon. Uncertainty surrounding recruitment of alewife, the principal prey of all stocked salmonids, is considered, and sustainability of alewife is cast in probabilistic terms. The interaction between size-selective predation and chinook salmon growth rates leads to a relatively narrow range of chinook salmon stocking that should keep the alewife eaten small (thus having relatively low PCB concentrations) but not reduce the age structure of the alewife population to few reproductive individuals. Stocking rates necessary to achieve PCB consumption advisories less than or equal to 0.5 mg/kg fish mass carry approximate to 90% probability of an alewife population crash. Modest increases (25%) in current stocking rates would decrease PCB concentrations of chinook salmon without a large increase in the probability that the alewife population would crash. These results are applicable to other salmonids (coho salmon and lake, rainbow, and brown trout), because they too exhibit size selective predation, and their recruitment is largely determined by stocking.

AB A generalized, lumped-parameter model of carbon (C), water, and nitrogen (N) interactions in forest ecosystems (PnET-CN) is presented. The model operates at a monthly time step and at the stand-to-watershed scale, and is validated against data on annual net primary productivity, monthly carbon and water balances, annual net N mineralization, nitrification, foliar N concentration and annual and monthly N leaching losses for two sites, Hubbard Brook (West Thornton, NH) and Harvard Forest (Petersham MA). It is then used to predict transient responses in function resulting from changes in land use and N deposition, as well as the maximum rate of N cycling which can be sustained for any given combination of site, climate and species. Model predictions suggest a very long legacy effect of land use history on N cycling. Even with only one 'active' soil organic matter pool, complete recovery from three modest harvests at Hubbard Brook is predicted to require more than two centuries at current N deposition rates. Complete recovery is predicted to take even longer at the Harvard Forest where biomass removals have been more intense. PnET-CN is used to predict maximum sustainable rates of N cycling for 14 sites throughout the northeastern USA. Predicted maximum values were higher, as expected, than measured N mineralization rates for all but one site. The measured fraction of N mineralization nitrified at these 14 sites showed a general relationship with the ratio of measured to maximum net N mineralization. This latter ratio is discussed as a potentially useful indicator of the degree of nitrogen saturation in forest ecosystems. A regional map of predicted maximum N cycling rates is presented based on regressions between model predictions and summary climatic variables. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB The value of biodiversity is usually confused with the value of biological resources, both actual and potential. A sharp distinction between biological resources and biodiversity offers a clearer insight into the value of biodiversity itself and therefore the need to preserve it. Biodiversity can be defined abstractly as the differences among biological entities. Using this definition, biodiversity can be seen more appropriately as: (a) a necessary precondition for the long term maintenance of biological resources, and therefore, (b) an essential environmental condition. Three values of biodiversity are identified and arranged in a hierarchy: (1) the self-augmenting phenomenon of biodiversity maintains (2) the conditions necessary for the adaptive evolution of species and higher taxa, which in turn is necessary for providing humans with (3) a range of biological resources in the long term. Two broad policy implications emerge: increments of biodiversity should not be traded off against biological resources as if they were the same, and the conservation of biodiversity should be a constraint on the public interest, not a goal in service of the public interest.

AB Policy reforms and structural adjustment programs in Sahelian countries have eliminated many public agricultural support programs, creating a vacuum that has not yet been filled by the private sector, Sahelian farmers thus face more difficult access to inputs and higher input costs, Input use has stagnated or declined, yet higher population and less land for expansion of cultivation make it vital to increase the productivity of already cultivated land through adoption of intensive agricultural production techniques, While partial intensification is becoming common, too little investment is occurring in inputs and land improvements that maintain soil fertility, control erosion, and improve water availability, Partial intensification therefore risks being an unsustainable strategy, Higher and more sustainable productivity growth requires significantly increased use of chemical and organic fertilizer, improved seeds, bunds, and animal traction, The dilemma is how to ensure that such investments are financially and economically profitable and affordable in terms of government budgets. It is crucial to: (1) improve input access and reduce the unit cost of inputs to farmers through infrastructure investment; (2) increase the productivity of fertilizer and improved seed by encouraging complementary farm-level investments; (3) improve the coordination of input and output marketing systems, and improve incentives for private sector involvement; (4) improve farmers' ability to buy inputs using credit and non-farm income; (5) reduce the financial risks of purchased input use through integrated input/output markets and innovative credit schemes; and (6) evaluate the net economic benefits of selected agricultural support programs, including input subsidies.

ID INTRINSIC VALUE; ECOLOGY
AB The signing and ratification of the Convention on Biological Diversity has resulted in increased scientific and public interest in the conservation and utilisation of biological diversity. This has in turn triggered the need to develop more effective methodologies to conserve biological diversity for the benefit of all humanity. One of the first factors to be considered when conserving botanical diversity is the efficient and effective selection of the target taxa. The aim of this paper is not to set detailed priorities for the genetic conservation of the plant genetic resources of any particular crop or species complex, but to draw attention to the factors that should be considered when formulating priorities. The factors that are considered important when selecting plant genetic resource targets are: current conservation status; potential economic use; threat of genetic erosion; genetic distinctiveness; ecogeographic distribution; biological importance; cultural importance; cost, feasibility and sustainability; legislation; ethical and aesthetic considerations; and priorities of the conservation agency undertaking the conservation. Each of these factors is discussed in turn. Although it is not possible to provide a single methodology for the selection of plant genetic resource targets at this time, it is hoped that the consideration the factors discussed will make the selection of target taxa more object, make better use of the limited conservation resources and thus enhance the process of genetic conservation as a whole.

DE China; environment; development; markets; peasants; state legitimacy
AB China's contemporary paradox springs from spectacular economic growth built upon a foundation of environmental degradation. Combined with rapid social stratification, serious challenges to the state's legitimacy result at a time when its ability to meet the needs of the broad majority is constrained by both structural and political limitations. These contradictions will become increasingly apparent as more critical assessments are made of the reform era. The agrarian sector, through articulation into new markets, is being transformed through short-term practices that emphasize individual income over long-term sustainable development. Using a multi-level analysis, this paper illustrates these issues through village and household case studies in northeast China, contextualized within a brief overview of the reform era, and China's rapidly changing global position.

   The case of Chilean salmonid production
SO GEOFORUM

DE Chile; salmon; aquaculture; environment; sustainability; regulation
AB Chilean salmon aquaculture has exhibited dynamic growth since its introduction on a commercial scale in the early 1980s (IFOP, 1994). The indicators of growth show no immediate signs of abating, despite lower prices, and Chilean production now ranks second only to Norway in international production. The industry's efficiency and profitability depends primarily on two factors: optimal food utilisation to achieve a maximal rate of growth at a minimum cost and the control of mortality in the farmed fish population. The management of these factors has direct and indirect effects on the fresh water and marine environments of production sites. Many of these effects can be linked to the contamination of aquatic environments. The regulation of the industry to control these effects will determine its sustainability. This paper argues two points. The first point is that responsibility for the monitoring and regulation of the salmon aquaculture industry should lie with the state, especially in terms of environmental quality. The second point is the need to establish the degree to which intensive salmon aquaculture in Chile is sustainable at its current rate of expansion. In both cases, it is stressed that state regulation should be broader and more efficient than at present if the industry is to have a more sustainable future. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB An inherent aspect of hydrogeology is the dynamic character of groundwater flow within the more passive lithospheric medium. Prediction therefore requires insight into the spatial pattern of aquifer properties as well as the dynamic character of groundwater flow systems. Both aspects together determine hydrogeological system behaviour in space and time. The spatial characteristics of an aquifer are mainly based on geological and geomorphological structure, whereas the dynamics of the system result predominantly from climate and topography; knowledge of paleoconditions are a prerequisite for sound understanding of present systems. The integration of exploration and forecast is illustrated by two case studies. The first study focuses on an assessment of groundwater resource and their sustainable development in semi-arid Botswana. The second study concerns the impact of land and water management in the Netherlands coastal area on the groundwater regime and its future development, including the redistribution of salt and fresh groundwater on a long time scale.

AB 'Emperor' broccoli (Brassica oleraceae L. Botrytis Group) was grown in Fall 1995 at the Beltsville Agricultural Research Center (BARC), Md., and at the Kentland Agricultural Research Farm (KARF), Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State Univ., Blacksburg. The objectives were to determine the effects of cover crop mulches in no-tillage production systems on marketable broccoli yield and weed suppression, The mulch treatments included cover crops of forage soybean (Glycine max L.), foxtail millet (Setaria italica L.P. Beauv), and a combination of soybean and millet. Broccoli marketable yield from all three mulch treatments was equal to that from a conventional clean cultivation system, except for the millet treatment at BARC, which produced a lower yield. All treatments maintained weeds below levels that reduced yield, Cover crop biomass ranged from 4.6 to 9.6 t.ha(-1) and N content from 10 g.kg(-1) for millet to 28 g.kg(-1) for soybean.

ID CONSERVATION
AB A comparison was made of Canadian sphagnum peat (SP) and Philippine coconut (Cocos nucifera L.) coir dust (CD) as growing media components for Dieffenbachia maculata [(Lodd.) G. Don] 'Camille' greenhouse production, Three soilless foliage plant growing mixes [Cornell, Hybrid, Univ. of Florida #2 (UF-2)] were prepared using either SP or CD and pine bark (PB), vermiculite (V), and/or perlite (P) in the following ratios (percent by volume): Cornell = 50 CD or SP:25 V:25 P, Hybrid = 40 CD or SP:30 V:30 PB, UF-2 = 50 CD or SP:50 PB, Initial Cl concentrations and electrical conductivities were higher for CD-containing media (CDM) than SP-containing media (SPR;I). At termination, Ca, Mg, and NO3-N concentrations were higher for SPM than CDM, Bulk densities were lower for CDM than SPM for one medium, but not for the others. Water-filled pore space (W-FPS) and water-holding capacity (W-HC) were larger and air-filled pore space (A-FPS) generally was smaller for CDM than SPM. Cornell had the highest W-FPS and W-HC, lowest A-FPS and percentage of large particles, and produced the highest grade and heaviest plants, Plant top grades, fresh mass and overall mass, but not root grades and mass, were higher for CDM than SPM, Plant mass was positively correlated with initial medium W-HC but not with A-FPS. Lower K in mix UF-2 compared to the mixes containing vermiculite may have been partly responsible for the lesser growth in that mix.

DE flood inundation; ERS-1 SAR; remote sensing
AB Recent years have been marked by a continuous availability of spatial SAR data since the launch of the European remote sensing satellite (ERS-1) in 1991. Consequently, remote sensing techniques now offer an opportunity to map flood inundation fields caused by river overflow or waterlogging in environments characterized by frequent cloud cover. Indeed, inundation fields can clearly be seen on ERS-1 SAR images taken during flooding periods. However, such an identification can be constrained by the similarity in behaviour between water surfaces and other features of the landscape such as extended asphalt areas, permanent water bodies and less illuminated slopes. For consistent flood inundation extent mapping a more robust approach is required. This is provided by a conceptual flood inundation index that is physically sound in relation to radar imaging. Moreover, this index has proved to be useful for highlighting soils located within inundation fields and having significantly different internal drainage. The results achieved in the frame-work of the research must be seen in the context of intensive use of remote sensing data to support decision methods for sustainable management of land and water resources. Such decision support methods could be provided by river hydraulic models aimed at assessing environmental effects of inundation floods and at early flood warning systems.

TI Society's interaction with the water cycle: A conceptual framework for a
   more holistic approach
SO HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper takes as its starting point today's paradoxical situation where a global water crisis is threatening a world in which water illiteracy is widespread among those expected to cope with that crisis. This creates a huge communication challenge for hydrologists, having to brief decision makers, diplomats and politicians in a manner that is simplistic without being water-reductionistic. The paper proposes some simple explanatory models, to be used for explaining and visualizing fundamental man/water interactions, It also discusses environmental sustainability criteria and their consequences in terms of the capacity to support water dependent populations. Large stress is put on land/water interactions. The paper ends with a conceptual framework based on the water cycle, distinguishing between rural and urban water use, water structures for mobilizing water for such uses, side effects, and key points for societal control mechanisms.

AB The significance of water availability for sustainable development is discussed. A review of water-related areas of concern in Agenda 21, the blueprint for sustainability, is offered, with particular reference to its Chapter 18 devoted to freshwater resources. The problems of water resources of vulnerable areas are tackled for the examples of arid and semiarid lands, mountains and small islands. The importance of water resources assessment and its building block, hydrological observations, for sustainable development is demonstrated and the adverse tendencies of declining hydrological observation networks are reported. Hydrological network density is seen as one of the indicators of sustainable development. Hydrological and water resources systems are perceived only as a component of the complex global system. Therefore a holistic perspective is advocated, looking at the existing interrelationships and interfaces with other sub-systems, including social, economic, institutional, etc.

AB This paper presents the development of a framework for data collection network design that considers sustainable development goals. The proposed framework adopts sustainable development principles and incorporates and revises traditional methodologies used in data collection network design. Important components of the framework include a focus on hydrological information, the preservation of long term gauging stations, and the adoption of integrated ecosystem monitoring. The eventual adoption of the framework should ensure that hydrological information required for effective decision making in water resources is available even as hydrometric data collection networks are rationalized.

TI Consensus as the measure of sustainability
SO HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES
LA English
DT Article
AB Sustainable development is the new water resources paradigm of the 1990s. Yet its practical implications seem to be elusive. Metrics for measuring the level of sustainability are eagerly sought. It is very difficult to capture the important features, and maintain many of the valued details, of environmental and social systems when complete or appropriate economic accounting is attempted. A much more transcendent and flexible metric may be consensus. Consensus as a sustainability metric describes the level in which stakeholders are satisfied with a solution to a question. Consensus assumes that an appropriate group of stakeholders is able to collaborate in assessing proposed solutions to environmental problems or development initiatives. It also assumes that the collective best which a group of stakeholders has to offer implicitly provides insight to the needs of future generations. This paper describes an approach for assessing a level of consensus. The benefits are: estimation of areas of common understanding; and clarification of conflicting values.

TI Economics, entropy and sustainability
SO HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES
LA English
DT Article
ID NATURAL-RESOURCE SCARCITY; LAW RELEVANT; ECOLOGY
AB Neoclassical economics has only recently considered the problem of sustainability-how to provide for the well-being of future generations given ecological constraints. In general, the neoclassical economist perceives physical and ecological constraints on economy-environment interactions as inconveniences that will inevitably be overcome by substitution-the discovery of new economic resources or technologies allowing the conversion of noneconomic materials to economic goods. Ecologists and ecological economists, however, argue that the constraints will bind. The debate centres on the relevance of entropy to the economics of resource use: irrelevant in the neoclassical view, relevant in the ecological. This paper places entropy, within the context of neoclassical economic thought, as a limit to economic growth. The paper rigorously argues the existence of limits to knowledge and consequently to technology and substitution, undermining a basic assumption of neoclassical economics and establishing the relevance of entropy to economic theories of resource use.

AB This paper focuses on the measurement of the relative sustainability of renewable water resource systems. Being able to quantify sustainability makes it possible to compare alternative plans and policies, and to include sustainability as one of the multiple objectives to be considered when making decisions regarding the design and operation of these systems. Commonly used measures of reliability, resilience and vulnerability, based on subjective judgements concerning what is acceptable or unacceptable with respect to multiple system performance indicators, are combined into an index and used as a measure of changes in relative system sustainability over time.

TI Distributive fairness considerations in sustainable project selection
SO HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES
LA English
DT Article
ID EQUITY; EQUALITY
AB This work develops general fairness measures that may be used as criteria for sustainable project selection. Sustainable development, fair allocation objectives and empirical distance-based measures of fairness, and their evaluation are discussed. Generalized fairness measures are developed and extended for both intratemporal and intertemporal fairness comparisons. A preliminary application of the extended distance based fairness measures is then performed for a case study of the selection of an electricity supply project. The case study involves selecting between a dispersed diesel energy supply and centralized energy supply with land line energy distribution. Due to data limitations, the perceived fairness is measured in terms of the annual energy costs per megawatt-hour that result from implementing each alternative. The applied fairness measures indicate that intratemporal fairness, in terms of the distribution of user unit costs, may be increased by choosing the land line alternative and that there is no significant difference among alternatives with respect to intertemporal fairness. These results provide limited insight into the energy supply problem, however, and it is suggested that further analyses should be conducted when information regarding the environmental impacts and reliability of power supply for each of the alternatives becomes available.

AB The need for efficient pipe networks for urban water supply and drainage is introduced and discussed in the context of global sustainable development. The role of computer based analysis and design tools in the planning and operation of such systems is described, with the way in which these tools can help to minimize use of resources, energy and water losses being explained. In particular, numerical techniques such as Genetic Algorithms, which are based on the principles of natural evolution, are found to be particularly effective in dealing with the large, complex systems that typify urban water distribution networks. These evolutionary techniques are introduced and discussed, and several applications of the techniques to the development of efficient water systems are described. A case study on the use of these techniques in the calibration of an accurate mathematical model of an urban water distribution system is included.

AB Sustainable groundwater resources development implies use of groundwater as a source of water supply, on a long term basis, in an efficient and equitable manner sustaining its quality and environmental diversity. An understanding of the behaviour of a groundwater system and of its interaction with the environment is required to formulate a sustainable management plan. Mathematical models supported by field information play a key role in assessing the future behaviour of a system to stresses and to find effective operating conditions for sustainable development and management of groundwater resources. Basic principles for sustainable development are stressed and a brief review of two case studies is provided to illustrate how a systems approach and its computational framework of mathematical models can be used in addressing the main issue of water allocation satisfying some of the technical and environmental constraints.

AB Policy for research, development and commercialization of agricultural industrial products in the U.S. is subject to many forces. In the mid-1990s, important new information is available or forthcoming for policy makers to use in preparing our Nation's agenda for agricultural industrial products in the 21st century. Among those, new information sources are the US Department of Agriculture's budget and strategic plans, work by the President's Council on Sustainable Development, the 1996 Farm Bill passed by the U.S. Congress, and a biobased industrial products study by the National Academy of Sciences. It is concluded that the overall policy climate is very positive and, given broad collaboration from all sectors, opportunity is evident for the United States to transition to a more renewable resource-based economy.

TI Mutual insurance as an elusive concept in traditional rural communities
SO JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES

AB During the last two decades, economists have paid increasing attention to the role of informal risk-sharing arrangements as a privileged way through which traditional rural communities can achieve a significant degree of protection against income fluctuations and other hazards beyond their control. This article however argues that when they enter into such arrangements members of these communities are guided by a principle of balanced reciprocity (they expect a return from any contribution or payment they make) rather than by a true logic of mutual insurance. More precisely, they do not conceive of insurance as a game where there are winners and losers and where income is redistributed between lucky and unlucky individuals. None the less, traditional agrarian societies have proven able to develop a restricted range of sustainable forms of mutual insurance that avoid the aforementioned problem.

ID NUTRIENT MANAGEMENT; CORN; AGRICULTURE; SYSTEMS; IMPACT; YIELD
AB International attention has focused on agricultural production systems as non-point sources of pollution affecting the quality of streams, estuaries and ground water resources. The objective of the current study was to develop a model of nitrogen management on the dairy farm, and to perform sensitivity analyses in order to determine the relative importance of manipulating herd nutrition, manure management and crop selection in reducing nitrogen (N) losses from the farm. The importance of the method of N input to the farm (purchased feed, legume fixation, inorganic fertilizer, imported manure) was investigated, and the potential to reduce N losses from dairy farms was evaluated. Nitrogen balance equations were derived, and related efficiency coefficients were set to reference values representing common management practices. Total farm N efficiency (animal product N per N input), and N losses per product N were determined for different situations by solving the set of simultaneous equations. Improvements in animal diet and management that increase the conversion of feed N to animal product by 50% would increase total farm N efficiency by 48% and reduce N losses per product by 36 to 40%. In contrast, reducing losses from manure collection, storage and application to improve the percentage of manure N that becomes available in soil by 100% would only improve total farm N efficiency by 13% and reduce total N losses by 14%. Selecting crops and management that can use soil nutrients 50% more efficiently would improve total farm efficiency by up to 59% and reduce N losses by up to 41% depending on the predominant nitrogen sources to the farm. Legume production would reduce N losses per product compared with non-legumes. There was more than a five fold difference in N losses per animal product N between the most extreme scenarios suggesting considerable opportunity to reduce N losses from dairy farms.

AB Genetic relationships among Rousettus egyptiacus, R. angolensis, Myonycteris torquata, and M. brachycephala were studied based on a starch-gel electrophoretic analysis of 31 presumptive loci encoding 22 enzymatic systems. Data were analyzed by both phenetic and phylogenetic procedures, considering both allele and loci as characters. All of the analyses (both quantitative and qualitative) showed a high level of concordance in establishing R. (Lissonycteris) angolensis, M. torquata, and M. brachycephala as a monophyletic group. Nevertheless, none of the analyses was clearly able to identify sister groups among these taxa. Based on the evidence generated here and from previous independent datasets, the maintenance of Lissonycteris within the genus Rousettus is not sustainable.

AB To empirically discriminate between Ricardian and non-Ricardian behaviour, we have to use a method that distinguishes between expected and unexpected, as well as permanent and transitory changes in taxes and government consumption. One method that provides these distinctions between different types of changes is the common trends framework used in this paper, which is a VAR model with cointegrating constraints. In the empirical study of US data, there is some support for the Ricardian hypothesis, but there are also some deviations from its predictions. However, the differences do not lend support to a Keynesian view of budget deficits, but rather to the view of expansionary fiscal contractions. This can be motivated theoretically by uncertainty about future taxes in combination with prudent households.

DE environmental strategy; island resources; Mallorca; sustainable
   development
AB There can be a particularly fragile balance between water supply and demand in small island communities (such as Mallorca) which hare developed a reliance on tourism. Over-abstraction has caused an increase in salinity of groundwater resources and has exacerbated a general shortage of fresh water. The island also has important ecological reserves, but such habitats and species are threatened by the development of tourism and intensive agriculture.
   The paper describes the environmental strategies for water, ecology, agriculture and landscape devised for a proposed new town. These strategies were the basis for integration of other elements, including renewable energy waste and transport - all designed with sustainable principles. The strategies were incorporated into the winning masterplan for an international competition which was organized by the Govern Balear.

AB The Environment Agency has a statutory duty to secure the proper use of water resources, which is now considered inter alia to include an economically efficient allocation of resources as far as is possible within the current legislation. This paper considers the practical extent to which water rights can be traded within the existing system of regulation as a means of (a) improving the economic efficiency of resource allocation, and (b) satisfying customer demand for additional supplies. Outline proposals are also made for deregulation of current legislation to encourage further trading through less restrictive regulation.

AB Virtually every product, service or the way they are produced and delivered can be copied, often in a different part of the world, almost over night. The window of opportunity before a competitive offering enters the market is shrinking. The solution lies in identifying the intangible competitive advantages-those not easily visible to the competitors and therefore almost impossible to copy. These are types and levels of knowledge shared by organizational teams. The benefits are a sustainable competitive advantage, tower operating costs and higher revenue. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Jurassic shares and mudrocks from the Haltenbanken area offshore Norway and red claystones from Carboniferous and Permian intervals of Northern Germany were used in a study of the hydrocarbon sealing efficiency of elastic sediments. The investigations comprised geochemical and mineralogical analysis of the pelitic rocks, petrophysical characterisation by mercury porosimetry and specific surface area measurements, and laboratory experiments to assess the transport properties with respect to both molecular transport (diffusion) and volume flow (Darcy flow). Effective diffusion coefficients of methane in the water-saturated rock samples at 150 degrees C lay between 1.4 x 10(-11) and 4.5 x 10-(10)m(2)/s and showed a distinct correlation with TOC content. Permeability coefficients, measured by means of a steady-state method, ranged from <1 nDarcy (<10(-21)m(2)) for Permian (Rotliegend) and Carboniferous red claystones up to 4.3 mu Darcy (4.3 x 10(-18) m(2)) for a bioturbated Jurassic siltstone.
   The experimental data were used to calculate maximum sustainable gas and petroleum column heights, hydrocarbon leakage rates by pressure-driven volume flow (Darcy flow), and diffusive gas losses for simple, hypothetical scenarios. Computed maximum gas column heights range from 20 m up to >2000 m. Hydrocarbon column heights calculated on the basis of a rich condensate lay between 3 and 340 m. Depending on temperature, pressure, reservoir geometry and seal thickness, diffusive losses can be expected to require tens of millions of years to significantly affect the contents of commercial size natural gas reservoirs.

AB In the tropical Andes, a long tradition exists in the utilization and mobilization of rural resources. In certain periods, agriculture and settlement patterns were well adapted to the specific local environmental conditions; at other times, constraints of the natural environment, of historical burdens, and of current social, economic, and political problems contributed to widespread conditions of poverty and underdevelopment.
   This paper examines the development issues and the activities of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and a number of affiliated agencies in two representative regions of highland Bolivia: the northern Altiplano and the eastern Cordillera region in the Departamento de Cochabamba. Based on documentation of the agencies and on numerous talks and formal interviews with representatives of the NGOs and the campesinos, an attempt was made to identify the major problems and constraints of specific micro-regions, as well as the perceived development priorities, and the strategies of the agencies and local communities to implement the development process.
   Although the NGOs may use different approaches and methods, it became obvious that the key to successful and sustained development lies in programs and projects that take into account the specific local environmental conditions, the cultural traditions of the indigenous communities, and the felt needs of the local people. Based on these premises, an effective partnership may be established between NGOs and the campesinos which can lead to a mobilization of local human and material resources and to appropriate sustainable forms of rural development.

AB Crop rotation and other ancient agricultural practices have been inappropriately replaced by the use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides. Today, it is recognized that the old traditional methods have potential for sustainable agriculture. This ongoing study (1993-1998) evaluates the effects of monocropping and crop rotation on yield, above-ground biomass, and weed populations of four Andean crops: potato (Solanum tuberosum), melloco (Ullucus tuberosus), lupine (Lupinus mutabilis), and quinoa (Chemopodium quinoa), planted both with and without fertilizer. The results of research during the first three years are presented here. Crop rotation increased marketable yields of quinoa, compared to monocropping. Potato yields followed the same trend in 1995. Lupine gave the best results as previous crop; when non-fertilized quinoa and potato were planted after non-fertilized lupine, yields were 44-188% higher than those planted as non-fertilized monocrops. Weed populations were affected only by the current season crop. Previous-season crop and previous-season fertilizer did not affect weed population dynamics. Again, lupine was the most successful current crop in maintaining lower weed populations. The first three years of the experiment indicate that lupine should be planted as the first crop in rotation systems for highland agriculture in Ecuador. Also, fertilized potato followed by non-fertilized quinoa, and melloco followed by quinoa with or without fertilization are the recommended sequences.

AB This paper examines the history of vicuna conservation in Peru over the last thirty years. During this period management strategies have shifted from protection to sustainable utilization, from a centralized administration with use of armed park guards and disenfranchisement of the campesino communities, to investing the legal custody of the vicuna, together with responsibility for its protection and the right to utilize products obtained from live animals, in the campesino communities located on lands where the lives. Although many questions remain to be answered concerning the impact of these changes, financial benefits obtained by the communities from sales of live shorn fiber far exceed those from hides sold on the black market, providing a powerful incentive to protect the species, and recent survey data record a decline in poaching.

AB Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, Rhizobium bacteria and plant-growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) were isolated from a representative area of a desertified semi-arid ecosystem in the south-east of Spain. Microbial isolates were characterized and screened for effectiveness by a single-inoculation trial in soil microcosms. Anthyllis cytisoides L., a mycotrophic pioneer legume, dominant in the target mediterranean ecosystem, was the test plant. Several microbial cultures from existing collections were also included in the screening process. Two AM fungi (Glomus coronatum, native, and Glomus intraradices, exotic), two Rhizobium bacteria (NR4 and NR9, both native) and two PGPR (A2, native, and E, exotic) were selected. A further screening for the appropriate double and triple combinations of microbial inoculants was then performed. The parameters evaluated were biomass accumulation and allocation, N and P uptake, N-2-fixation (N-15) and specific root length. Overall, G. coronatum, native in the held site was more effective than the exotic G. intraradices in co-inoculation treatments. In general, our results support the importance of physiological and genetic adaptation of microbes to the whole environment, thus local isolates must be involved. Many microbial combinations were effective in improving either plant development, nutrient uptake, N-2-fixation or root system quality. Selective and specific functional compatibility relationships in plant response between the microbial inoculants, were observed. Despite the difficulty of selecting a multifunctional microbial inoculum, appropriate microbial combinations can be recommended for a given biotechnological input related to improvement of plant performance. This could be exploited in nursery production of target plant species endowed with optimized rhizosphere/mycorrhizosphere systems that can be tailored to help plants to establish and survive in nutrient-deficient, degraded habitats. The relevance of this microbial-based approach in the context of a reclamation strategy addressed to environmental sustainability purposes is discussed.

AB Attention is being paid to improving the N-2 fixation of promiscuous nodulating soybeans in an attempt to develop sustainable cropping systems in the moist savanna. There is however a dearth of reliable estimates of N-2 fixation by these promiscuous soybeans and hardly any quantitative information is available on their residual N benefits to subsequent cereal crops grown in the southern Guinea savanna zone. The N-15 isotope dilution method was used to assess symbiotic N-2 fixation and response to inoculation and N contribution of three IITA promiscuous and two Brazilian soybean lines grown in the field at Mokwa (southern Guinea savanna) for two years. Rhizobial inoculation increased total N and grain yield of early maturing cultivars IAC 100 and TGX 1456-2E but did not affect the late maturing cultivar TGX 1660-19F. Both fixed N (Ndfa) and N derived from the soil were the major sources of N accounting for 84 and 75 kg N ha(-1) or 46 and 43%, respectively, of the plant total N. A line effect was, however, apparent with the late maturing line TGX 1660-19F deriving on the average 126 kg N ha(-1) or 52% of plant total N from N-2 fixation compared to the early maturing line IAC 100 with 37 kg N ha(-1) or 38%. Total N accumulated and amounts of N-2 fixed were low during early growth (V-2/V-3 and R-1/R-2 stages), but increased rapidly after this period to reach the maximum at R-3/R-4 and then dropped after R-3/R-4. The proportion of Ndfa, however, increased with the growing period. At the physiological maturity (R8), N-2 fixed accounted for an average of 70% of total N accumulated in the seeds. Roots accumulated about 13% while leaves and stems had 53 and 32% of the entire plant N at R-3/R-4, respectively. It was estimated after grain removal, that soybean growth led to a net contribution of an average of 18 kg N ha(-1) to soil N. However, the N contribution ranged from -8 to 43 kg N ha(-1) depending on the soybean cultivars and inoculation treatment.

AB In the past few years, several countries in Sub-Saharan Africa conducted large scale demobilizations. These are positive signs and create opportunities for sustainable peace and human development. However, demobilization appears to be a complex process. It is closely linked to security issues; and the impact of demobilization depends largely on whether the ex-combatants are able to reintegrate. Demobilized soldiers and guerrilla fighters have usually great difficulties reestablishing themselves in civilian life. Frustrated ex-combatants may jeopardize the peace and development process. This paper identifies on the bases of the recent experiences some of the risks that are involved in demobilization and several conditions that have to be met in order for demobilization to attain a lasting positive impact on peace and human development in Africa.

AB Significant investments are being made by aid agencies to increase Master's-level training of African professionals serving in the public sector. Yet no case studies present detailed data or analysis of past efforts to build sustainable human capacity in governmental institutions. The article reviews career and retention data on 169 economists, planners, and statisticians trained under funding provided by 6 long-term aid projects for targeted posts in Kenyan ministries. After reviewing retention constraints revealed by this data and other evidence, it offers recommendations that might assist governments and aid agencies to design and implement capacity building initiatives with a higher probability of ensuring that returned graduates serve for adequate periods of time in the positions for which they were trained.

AB There is an increasing need for data on land-cover changes at broad spatial scales. In this study, a remote sensing-based technique for land-cover-change analysis was applied to the African continent for the last decade. Ten years of daily, continental-scale satellite remote sensing data (from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's advanced very-high resolution radiometer) were analyzed. Deviations in the seasonal trajectory of the land surface-characterized by its brightness temperature and a vegetation index-were interpreted in terms of land-cover change on a yearly basis, from 1982 to 1991. Land-cover-change magnitudes were measured and mapped for every year. The major categories of seasonal patterns of changes were identified. Multiyear patterns of change also were categorized, and all areas affected by a continuous decrease and gain in vegetation cover over the decade were mapped. Results were related to published high-resolution remote sensing-based studies. This study's results demonstrate that interannual land-cover changes in Africa mostly involve erratic variations in land-cover conditions due to interannual climatic variability and temporary modifications in seasonality. Continuous, unidirectional change processes (decrease or gain in vegetation cover) affected less than 4% of sub-Saharan Africa during the study period. Although such linear changes are just a fraction of the total land-cover changes detected, their effect on ecosystems and sustainability of livelihood might be significant. In the semiarid regions, temporary modification of the biophysical attributes of the surface driven by variations in rainfall is the dominant process. Future work will focus on finer-scale interpretation and validation of patterns of changes. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1997.

TI English county councils and their agenda for waste minimisation
SO RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING
LA English
DT Article
DE commercial and household wastes; county councils; England; minimisation;
   policies and programmes
AB Minimisation is the top priority of the waste management hierarchy, which is one of the guiding principals for national solid waste management planning throughout the developed world. As such it should be encouraged as a means for reducing wastes which require treatment and disposal, whether they be household, commercial or industrial in source. This paper suggests that minimisation is not being given the necessary policy frameworks or legislation within which to develop in the UK, and questions whether minimisation is being afforded the respect and attention, from all levels, that is due the most preferable waste option according to the hierarchy. This theme is investigated by surveying the county councils of England as a representative sample of waste disposal authorities in England, and former waste regulation authorities. They are responsible for guiding local and district waste policy and are the regional waste planners in the UK. If they are not seriously taking on board the message of minimisation, then there is little chance that it will succeed without further legislative developments. Some 59% of English counties have a minimisation policy, whilst only 47% have participated in and supported a minimisation programme or trial within their region. The majority of these developments have occurred within the last three years, and 78% of counties who have participated in a programme have found it a successful venture. By 1999 79% of English counties will have been actively involved in a minimisation programme in their region, which is a positive scenario. This trend must continue if waste minimisation is to become the key theme of future sustainable waste management in the UK as was intended by declarations at the Rio '92 conference and in subsequent UK Government policy and strategy.

AB Application of information technology and environmental planning share two very important characteristics: they are both concerned with planning, evaluating, and directing human activity in a wider context, and this activity is multiaspectual, multimodal, and multidisciplinary in scope. Further, the ideal in both cases is sustainable, long-term activity that brings overall good rather than harm. This paper discusses the multiaspectual nature of environmental sustainability and shows briefly how this understanding can be translated to the field of information systems.

AB The whale shark is the largest fish in the ocean, A tourism industry based on interacting with whale sharks has developed recently in Ningaloo Marine Park, off the coast of Western Australia, This is the only known, accessible place in the world where whale sharks congregate in significant numbers, Results from surveys of participants in the 'whale shark experience' are reported, with the experience found to be extremely satisfying for most consumers, Yet management questions relating to diver-to-shark separation distances, the appropriate number of operators, and the use of regulation, self-regulation and economic instruments, remain, The nexus between experiential aspects of the whale shark attraction and such management concerns is examined, and the usefulness of appropriate research in resolving management questions established, It is concluded that a judicious combination of management approaches is required to ensure the sustainable development of the whale shark tourism industry.

AB Ecotourism can take many forms and provide different levels of human and environmental benefits, The trend has been toward nonconsumptive forms of nature-based tourism, such as bird-watching and photographic tourism, Declining budgets, however, have forced many managers to look increasingly to consumptive uses of natural resources, which have more revenue-producing potential, One consumptive option, trophy or sport hunting, provides significantly higher revenues on a per visitor basis than photographic tourism, and it may also impact the environment less severely, The tourist hunting industries of six eastern and southern African countries are profiled, and models of their revenue collection and disbursement systems provided, The relative merits of the six systems are discussed in terms of the level of benefits which accrue to local people and to wildlife protection programs, An optimal revenue collection/disbursement system is proposed.

AB Insecticide-treated mosquito nets have an impact on mortality and morbidity ill young children under controlled conditions. When integrated into larger control programs, there is the danger chat rates of regular retreatment of the nets with insecticide will drop, greatly limiting their effectiveness as a public health intervention. In Bagamoyo District, Tanzania, rates of retreatment dropped significantly when payment for the insecticide was introduced, A series of neighbourhood (hamlet) meetings were held in all study villages to discuss people's concerns about the insecticide and ways to increase rates of retreatment. Although changes were made in the procedure for retreatment, rates of retreatment remained lower than expected and showed marked variation within as well as between villages. We then conducted unstructured key informant interviews as well as informal discussions in a village with strong variation between different sectors of the village in rates of retreatment. While logistical problems were most frequently cited as reasons not to bring nets for retreatment, political and social divisions within the community provided a better explanation. This is borne out by the low response to rearrangements in logistics which made retreating the nets significantly easier for households, and the higher response when changes were made in the channels of communication as well as the logistic features. It is clearly more difficult for villagers to appreciate the benefits of the insecticide than those of the nets. Great emphasis needs to be placed on the insecticide and its beneficial effects from the outset for any large-scale programme to be sustainable.

AB If food production is to become more sustainable, weed management systems will become subject to many internal and external constraints; these may sharply limit the available range of weed control methods. If so, it will be imperative to preserve efficacy of acceptable weed control methods by defending these against weed adaptation. Moreover, rapid and ongoing weed adaptation may explain the persistent nature of yield losses to weeds despite technological advances. Research is needed to assess the practical importance of ongoing weed evolution. The first step is to determine the risk of rapid weed adaptation to diverse control measures. Experimentally, this risk can be evaluated by determining heritabilities of traits conferring resistance to control measures, and then using ecological genetic methods to measure the actual magnitude of selection for such traits. Models of multivariate trait evolution can be used to determine the net effect of evolutionary forces bearing on weed adaptation to an integrated weed management system (IWMS). It may also be possible to take a preventive approach by designing agricultural systems so that their large-scale structure impedes weed adaptation to IWMS.

ID AGRICULTURAL EXTENSION
AB How effective is agricultural extension Is it worth the vast sums governments spend to provide it, mostly as a free service, to farmers worldwide? Relatively few studies exist that measure and compare the benefits of extension activities against their costs. In the absence of such data, this Pilot activity concentrated instead on demand. Would demand for extension services be high if they were no longer free? The existence of solid demand would presuppose some benefits from the service. Further, might charging for the service actually improve its quality and sustainability?
   The pilot program in Nicaragua described here set out to test whether a truly demand-driven extension system aimed at farmers with small-and medium-size holdings could be developed. The principal mechanism was a contribution by the farmer paid as a bonus to the extensionist: the aim was to introduce incentives for providers to improve the service through reward-linked to the quality of their work and to establish direct accountability of extensionist to client. The outcomes showed that the cofinancing concept can be successful. The article describes the design, implementation, and results in the expectation that the lessons learned may be of interest elsewhere.

AB After a decade of advocating market-based solutions to poverty and underdevelopment in sub-saharan Africa, policy analysts have begun to reexamine the actual and potential role of African stares and institutions in promoting sustainable development. While stressing the importance of flexibility, in policies and institutions, much of this debate rests on ahistorical approaches to understanding African institutions which portray them as inflexible and fragile, beleaguered by economic and political change rather than contributing to it. After reviewing some of the assumptions which inform recent debates, this essay argues for a more processual approach, which takes account of the negotiability and ambiguity of many institutional arrangements, drawing on a case study of recent changes in land rights and agricultural practices in a rural community in Ghana.

ID ECONOMIC-GROWTH; DEMOCRACY
AB Thirty years ago, Samuel Huntington criticized Western aid policy toward new states that assumed that economic improvement in the standard of living coupled with democratic institutions would yield a more stable and democratic state-building process. An extensive political economic literature on the developmental state has since emerged that explores the complex relationship between stare capacity, economic development and democracy, much of it critical of both the economist assumption, and the importance of democracy in achieving sustainable growth, at least in the initial stages of statehood. This literature, however, does not specifically relate to the impact of international aid affects state consolidation despite its critical role in the initial stages of new states. The paper explores how international aid affects on new state formation in the 1990s as reflected by the Palestinian experience, and more specifically whether Huntington's criticism is valid today regarding the international aid regime toward the Palestinian Authority established in May 1994. It shows that international aid was initially based on economist assumptions, changed course to reflect the importance of the state, and now must seek a better balance between the centralization of power, developing stale capacity, and promoting civil society.

AB Attention to gender differences in property rights can improve the outcomes of natural resource management policies and projects in terms of efficiency, environmental sustainability, equity, and empowerment of resource users. Although it is impossible to generalize across cultures and resources, it is important to identify the nature of rights to land, trees, and water held by women and men, and how they are acquired and transmitted from one user to another. The paper particularly examines how the shift from customary tenure systems to private property-in land, trees, and water-has affected women, the effect of gender differences in property on collective action, and the implications for project design.

AB Sustainable timber extraction through selective logging has been proposed as a method of forest management that can help curtail the rate of tropical deforestation. This paper reports canopy removal and residual stand damage estimates for a controlled selective logging operation in lowland swamp forest of northeast Costa Rica. The logging procedure only harvested Carapa nicaraguensis (Meliaceae) trees of at least 70 cm dbh (diameter at 1.4 m or above buttresses). Logging removed 6.3 trees ha(-1) (SD = 4.2) from 28 ha, and 45.8 m(3) ha(-1) from a 7 ha subsample. Canopy cover was 91% (SD = 4.5) in undisturbed forest, and 73% (SD = 12.4) in logged forest. Post-logging canopy cover was negatively correlated with the number of trees extracted ha(-1). Prior to logging, 65% of total gap area was contained in gaps less than 250 m(2). After logging, gaps of over 500 m(2) represented 78% of total gap area. Stand basal area in 7 ha of inventoried forest was reduced by 18.3%, and 17.6% of residual stems were damaged or killed. Wet soil conditions required the use of 5.3% of residual stems to construct corduroy skid trails. Thus, 30% of all residual stem damage resulted from soil conservation efforts. Stem damage estimates were compared with those reported from uncontrolled tropical logging operations. Although absolute levels of residual damage during controlled logging were quite low, there was no conclusive evidence that total residual damage was relatively lower than intensity-adjusted estimates of those other operations. In contrast, canopy removal during logging was lower than that in two other neotropical studies. Both residual damage and canopy removal can be decreased further by incorporating stricter felling guidelines; measures to reduce necessary levels of skid trail fortification would also decrease residual damage. The results are discussed in the broad context of tropical forest management. A conservative approach to tropical forestry increases the possibility of sustainable extraction of the resource.

AB Tick and tickborne disease (TTBD) control is a major component of animal health programmes protecting livestock, thereby enhancing global food security. The present methods for TTBD control are reviewed and an integrated use of the tools is recommended with a broader view of how to link TTBD control to the control of other parasitic diseases. The work of FAO in this field is presented and it is advocated that, although there are still areas that need further investigation, a stage has been reached whew robust integrated TTBD control schemes, based on ecological and epidemiological knowledge of ticks and their associated diseases, can be promoted and implemented. Major challenges are the implementation of these policies in the field through the continuation of the present on-going programme in Africa and support to Latin America and Asia. The importance of involving all parties, governments, international and private organisations and the agrochemical industry in developing sustainable, cost-efficient control programmes is stressed and a global strategy is proposed. The main thrust should now be to convince policy makers on the adoption of the strategies and veterinarians and farmers on their implementation. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Trypanosomosis is one of the most devastating diseases of animals and man in Sub-Saharan Africa. Over the past century numerous methods of control have been developed yet the disease has proved Very difficult to eradicate. Current methods to control the parasite, in the absence of a vaccine, have to rely on the use of trypanocidal drugs and trypanotolerant breeds of livestock. Vector control previously depended on ground and aerial spraying of insecticide but now depends on the use of traps, targets and bait technology. The application of insecticides to cattle is currently of particular interest. Unfortunately all of the current methods of control have disadvantages and none has proved to be sustainable. There is growing interest in integrated control which can be at three levels; integration with rural development, integration with other disease control measures and integration of various tsetse and trypanosomosis control measures. It is anticipated that distinct benefits can be achieved by an integrated approach which will improve the effectiveness of control and enhance the prospects of sustainability.

AB For sustainable livestock production it is suggested that the parasitologist take a leaf out of Nature's book in the search for solutions to the mounting problems concerning parasite control. While the farmer has come to regard all parasites affecting livestock as entirely without benefit, indigenous parasites and diseases are normal and play an essential role as interacting components of a natural environment in an ecosystem such as the 19000 km(2)-sized Kruger National Park, Republic of South Africa. The parasites help to select their hosts for fitness and are assisted by predators and intra-species territorial aggression which continually eliminate the weak individuals from the system. It is essential to guard against the introduction of foreign parasites or infectious agents which have no real ecological niche or role in an established ecosystem, however, as they cause untoward interactions, sometimes of a violent nature. The policy must be to block off or, failing that, to control or eliminate these foreign parasites and diseases as far as possible. Often, when Man intervenes in an ecosystem, it leads to stress, overcrowding and stagnation and predisposes to disease and death. Intensification of the system, as in farming units, denies Nature the chance to manage on its own, because of clashing interests with Man. Frank parasitism and disease should almost invariably be seen as indicators of an imbalance in the ecosystem and should be rectified. Chemicals and vaccines should be used to produce sufficient food for all, but without exploiting Nature, or else Nature will be unable to continue catering for Man's needs.

ID ANTHELMINTIC RESISTANCE; TROPICAL ENVIRONMENT
AB Widespread anthelmintic resistance, at least amongst the important nematode parasites of small ruminants, threatens the sustainability of these livestock industries throughout both the developed and developing world. The exacerbation of this problem over the last decade or so, has provided the impetus for research into non-chemotherapeutic parasite control alternatives, such as host genetic resistance, grazing management, worm Vaccines and biological control. Although some of these options provide practical benefits if currently adopted, or exciting prospects for the future, collectively they are unlikely to dispense with the need for the timely intervention of effective anthelmintic treatment. The issue of sustainability of helminth control practices therefore rests with the preservation of anthelmintic effectiveness through the implementation of principles of integrated pest management. Herein lies the difficulty-putting the principles into practice. Much of the research into sustainable nematode parasite control of ruminants has been done in the developed rather than the developing world, and the efforts to transfer this information to livestock owners has also been commensurately greater in the former. However the need for research and technology transfer is much more urgent in the developing world because of the lack of scientific and financial resources, the greater dependence on livestock industries and the much greater severity of the problem of anthelmintic resistance. This will require a major philosophical change in the affluent western world to the funding of national and international aid organisations who are largely responsible for these activities.

AB Trees have a different impact on soil properties than annual crops, because of their longer residence time, larger biomass accumulation, and longer-lasting, more extensive root systems. In natural forests nutrients are efficiently cycled with very small inputs and outputs from the system. In most agricultural systems the opposite happens. Agroforestry encompasses the continuum between these extremes, and emerging hard data is showing that successful agroforestry systems increase nutrient inputs, enhance internal flows, decrease nutrient losses and provide environmental benefits-when the competition for growth resources between the tree and the crop component is well managed. The three main determinants for overcoming rural poverty in Africa are (i) reversing soil fertility depletion, (ii) intensifying and diversifying land use with high-value products, and (iii) providing an enabling policy environment for the smallholder farming sector. Agroforestry practices can improve food production in a sustainable way through their contribution to soil fertility replenishment. The use of organic inputs as a source of biologically-fixed nitrogen, together with deep nitrate that is captured by trees: plays a major role in nitrogen replenishment. The combination of commercial phosphorus fertilizers with available organic resources may be the key to increasing and sustaining phosphorus capital. High-value trees-'Cinderella' species-can fit in specific niches on farms, thereby making the system ecologically stable and more rewarding economically, in addition to diversifying and increasing rural incomes and improving food security. In the most heavily populated areas of East Africa, where farm size is extremely small, the number of trees on farms is increasing as farmers seek to reduce labour demands, compatible with the drift of some members of the family into the towns to earn off-farm income. Contrary to the concept that population pressure promotes deforestation, there is evidence that demonstrates that there are conditions under which increasing tree planting is occurring on farms in the tropics through successful agroforestry as human population density increases.

AB Meeting the goal of long-term agricultural productivity requires that soil degradation be halted and reversed. Soil fertility decline is a key factor in soil degradation and is probably the major cause of declining crop yields. There is evidence that the contribution of declining soil fertility to soil degradation has been underestimated.
   Sensitivity to soil degradation is implicit in the assessment of the sustainability of land management practices, with wide recognition of the fact that soils vary in their ability to resist change and recover subsequent to stress. The concept of resilience in relation to sustainability requires further elaboration and evaluation.
   In the context of soil degradation, a decline in soil fertility is primarily interpreted as the depletion of organic matter and plant nutrients. Despite a higher turnover rate of organic matter in the tropics there is no intrinsic difference between the organic matter content of soils from tropical and temperate regions. The level of organic matter in a soil is closely related to the above and below ground inputs. In the absence of adequate organic material inputs and where cultivation is continuous, soil organic matter declines progressively. Maintaining the quantity and quality of soil organic matter should be a guiding principle in developing management practices
   Soil microbial biomass serves as an important reservoir of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and sulphur (S), and regulates the cycling of organic matter and nutrients. Because of its high turnover rate, microbial biomass reacts quickly to changes in management and is a sensitive indicator for monitoring and predicting changes in soil organic matter. Modelling techniques have been reasonably successful in predicting changes in soil organic matter with different organic material inputs, but there is little information from the tropics.
   Nutrient depletion through harvested crop components and residue removal, and by leaching and soil erosion accentuates the often very low inherent fertility of many soils in the tropics. An integrated approach involving inorganic and organic inputs is required where animal and plant residues are returned, as far as practicable. Chemical fertilizers alone cannot achieve long-term productivity on many soils and organic material inputs are required to maintain soil organic matter levels and crop productivity. A major research effort is required to develop improved strategies for halting and reversing soil degradation if long-term productivity is to be secured.

AB The major agricultural intensifications in the developed world over the last half century have produced a range of important environmental problems. These include pollution, damage to wildlife and landscape and other issues, both on- and off-site. These are largely being controlled by scientific investigation and Government regulation. As developing countries increase agricultural production over the next 30 years, this may also cause even more serious environmental damage.
   The paper distinguishes between production-related on-site damage, and off-site and more extensive effects. Both may involve soil and water effects, such as soil erosion, salinization, siltation, eutrophication and loss of water quality. The use of more agrochemicals can damage water quality, health, wildlife and biodiversity. Loss of habitat from the extension of farming is particularly damaging to biodiversity. A developing off-site problem is the production of greenhouse gases by farming systems, including the conversion of forests to farmland. In the future the introduction of genetically engineered species of plants, animals or microbes will need secure control.
   Much work, probably on a catchment basis, is necessary to understand and control these problems. The three main requirements are much better environmental information from the developing world; the selection of environmental indicators to be monitored; and the support of local farmers in protecting the environment. There are encouraging indications of farmer concern and action over obvious on-site damage, but this may not extend to extensive off-site issues. The main danger is that a developing food scarcity would cause the environmental issues to be ignored in a race for production.

SO PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON SERIES
   B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
AB The rapidly growing world population puts considerable pressure on the scarce natural resources, and there is an urgent need to develop more efficient and sustainable agricultural production systems to feed the growing population. This should be based on an initial assessment of the physical and biological potential of natural resources, which can vary greatly. The agroecological zonation (AEZ) approach presents a useful preliminary evaluation of this potential, and ensures that representation is maintained at an appropriate biogeographic scale for regional sustainable development planning. The principal AEZs of the world, as described by the Technical Advisory Committee of the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research, are presented along with their extent and characteristics. Net primary productivity of terrestrial vegetation can be assessed from weather data, and it varies from 1 t dry matter ha(-1) yr(-1) in high latitude zones and dry regions to 29 t ha(-1) yr(-1) in tropical wet regions, depending on the climatic conditions. To assess the crop production potential, length of the growing period zones, a concept introduced by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, is very useful as it describes an area within which rainfall and temperature conditions are suitable for crop growth for a given number of days in the year. These data, combined with the information on soils and known requirements of different food crops, can be used to assess the potential crop productivity. Some perspectives on AEZs and crop production potential are presented by describing the manner in which production potential can be integrated with present constraints. Efforts to intensify production should place emphasis on methods appropriate to the socio-economic conditions in a given AEZ, and on promotion of conservation-effective and sustainable production systems to meet the food, fodder and fuel needs for the future.

TI Economic reforms and state intervention in foodgrain market
SO ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL WEEKLY
LA English
DT Article
AB State intervention in the foodgrain market has io be considered in the light of the overall objectives of structural adjustment and economic liberalisation as also the impressive trends in cereal production.
   Public distribution of foodgrain should be singly directed only for securing food to the poor at low prices. For this purpose targeting of PDS should be area specific and group specific. Allocation for welfare schemes such as the mid-day meals scheme and for payment of wages in kind to labourers in rural employment schemes should continue.
   An increased role for the private sector in the foodgrain marker will provide the right signals to farmers in deciding their cropping patterns in line with the emerging demand for different agricultural commodities.
   As for relative foodgrain price stability, it is more sustainable and less costly to seek to achieve it through expansion of irrigation and technology, especially to the less developed regions. PDS is not the instrument for this purpose.

AB Expansion and intensification of cultivation are among the predominant global changes of this century. Intensification of agriculture by use of high-yielding crop varieties, fertilization, irrigation, and pesticides has contributed substantially to the tremendous increases in food production over the past 50 years. Land conversion and intensification, however, also alter the biotic interactions and patterns of resource availability in ecosystems and can have serious local, regional, and global environmental consequences. The use of ecologically based management strategies can increase the sustainability of agricultural production while reducing off-site consequences.

ID HOME GARDENS; MANAGEMENT; DIVERSITY
AB Forests are human-dominated ecosystems. Many of the seemingly lightly managed or unmanaged forests are actually in use for agroforestry or for hunting and gathering. Agroforestry does reduce biodiversity, but it can also act as an effective buffer to forest clearance and conversion to other land uses, which present the greatest threat to forested ecosystems. In forests used for logging, whole-landscape management is crucial. Here, emphasis is placed on areas of intensive use interspersed with areas for conservation and catchment purposes. Management strategies for sustainable forestry are being developed, but there is a need for further interaction among foresters, ecologists, community representatives, social scientists, and economists.

AB The present economy is not sustainable with regard to its per capita material consumption in the industrialized countries. A dematerialization of the economy of industrialized countries can only be achieved by a change in course, from an industrial economy where success is measured in throughput and its exchange value, to a service economy where success is measured in wealth (stock) and its usage value. Wealth management, new corporate and industrial design strategies and different economic policies can lead to a higher sustainability as well as an increased international competitiveness due to a substantially higher resource productivity. The term 'service economy' refers not to the tertiary sector, but to an economy where the majority of value is created by services and the majority of jobs are in service activities.

TI Farming: Closing the cycle
SO PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL
   AND ENGINEERING SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
AB The natural cycle of plant and animal life involves recycling materials through the open environment. Thus carbon dioxide and many waste substances are released to the soil or atmosphere and returned to be taken up by plants.
   Modern agriculture has intensified the production of many substances, with unwanted effects on the atmosphere (including global warming and acid rain), water and soil. Moreover, because most drops are grown as monoculture, competing plants, and pests and diseases, are controlled through a wide range of agrochemicals which also affect the environment; herbicides remain a major case of drinking water failing to meet the required standards.
   A 'clean technology' approach is urgently needed, and current research is showing the way. Research on the nitrogen cycle indicates, for example, that nitrogen losses from intensive dairy production can be reduced by up to 70%; however, changes to the whole farm system are needed to achieve results. Both engineering and biological approaches offer ways of reducing pesticide use; we can use computer control and decision support to improve the precision with which chemicals are applied; we can seek new understanding of chemical-insect-plant interactions which allow new control techniques (such as semiochemicals, which influence insect behaviour) to be derived.
   Agriculture can also provide a sustainable source of clean energy and could also supply industrial products such as oils and fibres, reducing our dependence on petrochemicals.

SO PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL

DT Article
AB Industrial ecology involves a systems view of material and energy flows in industry, where industry is thought of very broadly, and between industry and the environment. Closed loop material systems can lighten environmental burdens posed by society, and improve materials sustainability. Fundamental physical and chemical principles, and some experience, suggest that closing material circulation loops is likely to be both environmentally and economically beneficial.
   The metal manufacturing system contains complex metal recycling networks involving a variety of actors. Most metal produced as manufacturing 'waste' is recycled, but some wastes containing high concentrations of metals go to landfills for reasons of scale, and the idiosyncrasies of regulation. The greatest loss of manufactured metal appears to be through the disposal of consumer products to landfills.

AB The construction industry and the industries which supply it have a vital role to play in the evolution of a culture of clean technology. Buildings have a crucial impact on the physical and economic health and well-being of the individuals, communities and organizations which they are intended to support. The global impact of the built environment is increasingly evident. It is necessary for everyone involved to recognize the role of buildings in the quality of our lives and the extent of our responsibilities in creating a sustainable habitat.
   Buildings and their components are basic needs which should be socially responsible products able to contribute to our physical, psychological, cultural and economic well-being; yet they frequently contribute to ill health and alienation, undermine community and create significant financial liability. Modern planning, construction activity, building management and demolition processes are innately unclean and environmentally exploitative. We need to identify the consequences of our actions and to process these to show how we might create a healthy built environment within the ecological limits to which we must all defer. The existing culture of control of the environment must give way to a culture of appreciation and participation.
   This paper will investigate ecological principles to identify mitigation strategies and the cultural shift which is required to create the intergenerational buildings upon which our future development depends. A critical appraisal of the new generation of self-declared, environmentally benign buildings could assist in determining appropriate directions for evolution of the built environment.

AB This paper reviews the development of 'ecoefficiency' within S. C. Johnson Wax and suggests why this is one of the most important concepts in industry's progress towards the goal of sustainable development.
   Performance, cost, quality and safety are all elements that are built into products right from the design stage, through manufacture to supply to che end user. The emphasis on sustainability now demands the inclusion of environmental impacts factored equally with these other, more traditional, concerns. S. C. Johnson Wax's goal is to provide top quality and performance cleaning products; in so doing it often faces difficult cost trade-offs between the competing elements, but balanced commercial decisions have to be made.
   Ecoefficiency is more than a theoretical concept. It is employed throughout a product's life-cycle from design, through sourcing, manufacture and distribution to end use to ensure the most efficient deployment of resources. At S. C. Johnson we have found that ecoefficiency is a win for the environment it is invariably too a quantifiable win for the bottom line.

   This paper shows how the ultimate recovery and recycling have been integrated into the design of a novel polyurethane cushioning material which still meets all the performance requirements of today. Recycling was one aspect of the product design process which considered also the environmental impact of the whole life-cycle, from raw material manufacture, product fabrication, use and recycling to ultimate disposal.
   The practical implementation of closed-loop recycling involves more than chemistry. In this case, it requires commitment from furniture designers and manufacturers. Above all, it requires new processes for collection, dismantling and separation which become broader social responsibilities.

AB There are strong drivers at all levels towards a culture of more sustainable waste management. These drivers include those at an international level, such as the Rio Earth Summit, at a European level, such as the Fifth Action Programme (1993-2000) and national drivers, such as the strategy for sustainable waste management in England and Wales. The business response to these drivers has led to an emerging interest in moving away from a waste disposal mentality towards a materials management mentality in which waste is reused, recycled, reduced and minimized. This is considered to be a fundamental shift which will create a huge challenge for the waste management industry, requiring a robust and flexible strategically driven approach at the household, local authority and business levels.

AB Business has a substantial part to play in addressing the contemporary environmental challenge. This paper presents a model of wealth creation that can be applied to individual businesses or the economy as a whole, in order to understand the role of the environment in wealth creation and how this may cause its deterioration. From this model it is possible to derive principles and standards for environmental sustainability for the economy, from which a definition of a clean business is derived. To reduce its environmental impacts, a business needs to adopt new environmental reporting and accounting systems, which are discussed, together with evidence that such systems can enhance a firm's productivity and competitiveness. Government interventions, including the use of environmental taxes and charges, will be required for businesses generally to become cleaner, but the paper concludes that the leading companies that successfully become clean businesses ahead of legislative requirements may well save costs and gain competitive advantage from so doing.

The temperature of these residues has been obtained by analysing the kinematical characteristics (angular and kinetic energy distributions) of the coincident neutrons detected by the DEMON neutron detector, A total cross section of 50 mb has been measured for the production of residues with an initial temperature of 6 MeV or more. This result is compared with the predictions of a microscopic transport model. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB This paper summarises the key issues raised at a recent international conference entitled, 'Integrated Crop Protection: Towards Sustainability?' The British Crop Protection Council in association with the Sustainable Farming Systems initiative - a joint enterprise between the Scottish Agricultural College and the University of Edinburgh - organised during 1995 an international conference to address state-of-the-art studies in the theory and practice of weed, pest and disease management by integrated approaches. The conference also explored the contribution which sustainable fanning systems research can make to mainstream agriculture. The major recurring themes were: (i) are current crop protection practices sustainable?; (ii) the concept of sustainability; (iii) the biological roots of sustainability; (iv) anticipated developments in crop protection and sustainability; (v) food production and sustainability; (vi) experimentation on sustainable farming systems; and, finally, (vii) are integrated crop protection practices moving towards an increased sustainability? The key issues raised in theme (i) were: crop protection is of critical importance to all food production systems; and the way we protect our crops today has significant implications for future generations; theme (ii): the concept of degrees of sustainability, i.e. sustainability not as an absolute concept but with the potential for systems to be more or less sustainable; theme (iii): the essential nature of developing holistic knowledge of systems, and not simply by discipline only; theme (iv): the development of decision support technology, transgenic plants and semiochemicals as tools in future crop protection strategies; theme (v): the need for continued government funding to meet the twin, and often conflicting, demands of food production and sustainability; and themes (vi) and (vii): more emphasis must be given to systems experimentation and to technology transfer, respectively.

DE sustainability; agriculture; rural; farm systems; economy
AB In many developed economies, the mainly non-agricultural population shows concern for the management of the rural environment and there is increasing interest in the concept of sustainability. Public pressure manifests itself in many ways, including the demand for adjustments to agricultural support systems which may include elements of cross-compliance or modifications to the economics of farming systems, which in turn lead managers to reduce inputs. Better knowledge on the part of such managers in relation to the complexities of the environmental management of their crops may allow them to maintain gross margins at reduced levels of inputs and yields. Such changes, whilst maintaining farm incomes, may reduce the demand for inputs, including labour. Research results tend to be location-specific so, with highly variable ecologies across regions, it is very difficult to forecast the regional economic impacts of the adoption of sustainable systems. At the national level, aggregate reductions in the production of some commodities would assist in the achievement of the GATT agreements to reduce subsidised exports. There may also be changes to the comparative advantage of different regions across Europe. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB The paper outlines the importance of sustainability for farming systems from a natural, economic and social perspective, and it describes the policy options available to the agricultural sector and the government to devise sustainable farming systems in the context of the European Union. The present situation of farming systems is discussed, including the heavier demands farming makes on some natural resources while farming populations tend to decline. In seeking a framework to promote sustainable farming systems, a variety of policy options are examined, including price, structural and R&D policies. The feasibility of these policy changes is assessed in the context of the Common Agricultural Policy and its potential capacity to move away from a price/cost setting role to a more complex and multidimensional one.

AB As the control of any disease is most effective and economical if addressed at its onset, there is a need to detect potential epidemics before they decrease yields in sustainable farming systems. Diagnostic tests to detect plant pathogens are now based on a number of diverse technologies, yet to be effective a procedure must be simple, accurate, rapid and safe to perform, and be sensitive enough to avoid 'false positives'. These technologies have developed as considerable skill is required to identify, quantify or even detect the presence of pathogens at the start of an outbreak even when the final symptoms of a disease are frequently conspicuous. Although highly sensitive methods of diagnosis may not be as fast or simple as the conventional Visual examination of crop plants for disease symptoms, little training is required to generate routinely reliable results. Since no method of identifying pathogens or diseases is unrivalled in both reliability and simplicity, many diagnostic methods will probably continue to co-exist in some form in the future. In practice, different methods of diagnosing plant disease are often used in a complementary way rather than as alternatives. It is uncertain how much the traditional methods, such as identification by visual inspection of pathogens in situ or in vitro in pure cultures by microscopic examination, will decline as methods based on the molecular biology of pathogens become more prevalent. Electronic communication and retrieval systems are also likely to become useful. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB The study of chemical ecology, particularly involving pheromones and other semiochemicals that influence insect behaviour, promises methods of pest control as alternatives to the exclusive use of broad-spectrum toxicants. However, if the potential of semiochemicals in crop protection is to be realised, a greater understanding of insect/insect and insect/plant interactions, and insect chemical ecology generally, is essential. Semiochemicals, when employed alone, often give ineffective or insufficiently robust pest control. Use of semiochemicals should therefore be combined with other approaches in integrated management strategies. The main components of such strategies are pest monitoring, to allow accurate timing of pesticide treatments; combined use of semiochemicals, host plant resistance and trap crops, to manipulate pest behaviour; selective insecticides or biological control agents, to reduce pest populations. The objective is to draw together these approaches into a push-pull or stimulo-deterrent diversionary strategy (SDDS). In an SDDS, the harvestable crop is protected by host-masking agents, repellents, antifeedants or oviposition deterrents. At the same time, aggregative semiochemicals, including host plant attractants and sex pheromones, stimulate colonisation of pests on trap crops or entry into traps where pathogens can be deployed. Because the individual components of the SDDS are not in themselves highly efficient, they do not select for resistance as strongly as conventional toxicant pesticides, thereby making the SDDS intrinsically more sustainable.

AB An examination is made of the role that mathematical modelling can have in developing integrated strategies, involving reduced dependence on chemicals, for controlling weeds, pests and diseases in crops. From a detailed survey of the application of models to weed control, it is concluded that modelling has fundamentally been concerned with answering issues that contribute comparatively little to our understanding of 'sustainable' systems of crop protection. There has been a strong concentration of effort on simulating the impacts of herbicides and on identifying 'threshold' levels for spraying. Issues such as herbicide resistance, weed-crop interference and integrated weed management systems have received scant attention. None-the-less, given the complexity of the management systems involved in Integrated Crop Protection, mathematical modelling would seem to be a potentially valuable tool. In the case of some forms of control, such as biological and genetic, it is also arguable that modelling the consequences is imperative, given the potential risks involved.

ID MANAGEMENT
AB Integrated crop protection represents an approach to the control of pests that places the emphasis on the crop and cropping system rather than the individual pest disciplines. Broadly the challenge of integrated crop protection is two-fold: to synthesise available knowledge from a range of sources in order to achieve tactical, strategic or policy goals; and to identify key processes and interactions that require further analysis and research. This paper deals with the first of these challenges and considers how training and educational courses at universities can best be geared for the intending practitioner, the industry and policy-makers. Present curricula at Wageningen Agricultural University and EU-sponsored initiatives linking universities of the North and South are outlined. Although some progress has been made towards integrated crop protection, and training and education has been a key factor in its adoption, ultimately the success of integrated crop protection as a component of sustainable crop production will be judged on implementation in practice. That is the challenge for education and training. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Agri-environmental indicators are necessary to monitor the effectiveness of policies which promote sustainable agriculture. The model SYNOPS 1.1 will assess and compare the risk potential for the environment of active ingredients of plant protection products. It consists of five main steps: assessment of the application pattern of pesticides; assessment of environmental exposure of chemicals; assessment of the related biological risk; aggregation of the calculated indices and visualisation of the risk potentials.
   The model principles are applied to the best-selling insecticides in Germany in 1987 and 1994 to compare the risk situations. The model calculated a decline of risk potential in 1994 caused by changes in ranking of pesticides and by a considerable reduction in the number of potential pesticide applications.

ID GROWTH; FESCUE
AB Low-input sustainable turf (LIST) management represents a resource-efficient option in maintaining uniform, persistent turf. What species are best suited to such management needs to be established. To this end, 12 hardy species were evaluated for 3 yr in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Missouri, Ohio, and Wisconsin: crested wheatgrass [Agropyron desertorum (Fisch. ex Link) Schult. 'Fairway', 'Ephraim', and 'Ruff'], streambank wheatgrass [Agropyron riparium Scribn. & Smith 'Sodar'; syn. Elymus lanceolutus (Scribn. & J.G. Smith) Gould subsp. lanceolatus], Canada bluegrass (Poa compressa L. 'Reubens'), hard fescue [Festuca ovina var. duriuscula (L.) Koch 'Durar'; syn. F. lemanii T. Bastard], sheep fescue (F. ovina L. 'Covar'' and common), tall fescue (F. arundinacea Screb. 'Alta'), bulbous bluegrass (P. bulbosa L.), alpine bluegrass (P. alpina L.), redtop (Agrostis alba L. 'Reton'; Agrostis gigantea Roth), roughstalk bluegrass (P. trivlalis L. 'Colt'), colonial bentgrass (Agrostis tenuis Sibth. 'Exter'; syn. Agrostis capillaris L.) and buffalograss [Buchloe dactyloides (Nutt). Engelm. ''Texoka' and 'NE-315'], All were field-established and compared at three mowing heights: 3.8 cm, 7.6 cm, and no mowing. Quality ratings were based on uniform persistence. Tall fescue and common sheer fescue were the best and most broadly adapted to LIST. In Iowa, hard fescue, Canada bluegrass, and crested wheatgrass also did well. Calonial bentgrass was best adapted in Missouri. Redtop and roughstalk bluegrass grew better in a north-south area from Wisconsin through central Illinois to Missouri. The buffalograsses excelled in Ohio and southern Illinois. Over all species, the 7.6-cm mowing height allowed the best turf quality. Specifically, fall fescue, colonial bentgrass, redtop, and common sheep fescue performed best at the 7.6-cm mowing height. Covar sheep fescue, hard fescue, Canada bluegrass, and Fairway crested wheatgrass could not maintain persistent stands under the 3.8-cm mowing height. No mowing resulted in intermediate levels of quality with all species. A 7.6.cm mowing height would be appropriate for testing species In LIST within the seven-state region used in this study.

SO ANTHROPOLOGICAL QUARTERLY

ID POLITICS; POLICY
AB Anthropologists inspired by the works of Michel Foucault have described development as a discourse imposed on the Third World by powerful western institutions. In defining the power of such agencies (especially the World Bank) these authors focus not on the practices of actors or sets of actors, but rather on the ability of such institutions to shape perceptions of Third World peoples and to limit ways of thinking about the world and imagining change. While the focus on language Is helpful to understanding how development agendas are ''deployed'' throughout the world many critics overlook the important role of local elite groups as well as the agency of development's ''target populations.'' The uses of, and popular responses to, ''sustainable development'' and other development strategies in Bogota, Colombia, show that the development discourse is neither so monolithic nor so hegemonic as some critics suggest. Because of sustainable development's vague mandate and imprecise terminology, it has been easily manipulated and rewritten at the local level.

AB The establishment of national targets designed to bring about more sustainable waste management in many developed countries has not generally been accompanied by the creation of reliable information systems for policy formulation and monitoring. In the first part of this paper the factors that complicate the collection of reliable household waste statistics are examined from both applied and theoretical perspectives. The second part presents a critique of the recent UK National Household Waste Analysis Programme (NHWAP). This was based on waste-collection-round samples selected by means of a geodemographic classification package (ACORN), NHWAP data are currently the only national data on household waste composition and the results have already been widely used by policy-makers at national and local levels. However, it is concluded that the NHWAP sample was too limited for there to be much confidence in the results. A national research programme based on household samples is required in order to understand the relationships between household waste arisings and socioeconomic, institutional, spatial and temporal variables. An outline methodology is suggested. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

TI A dynamical economic model of sustainable agriculture and the ecosphere
SO APPLIED MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTATION
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper addresses relationships between structural parameters of a complex three-dimensional system and agricultural wealth subject to a minimum safe standard for the ecosphere. The subsystems are the ecosphere, agriculture, and industry. Their interaction is modeled by a dynamical system based on the predator prey paradigm. It is demonstrated that the system may surpass certain local and global bifurcations. The later ones lead to appearance and disappearance of strange attractors.
   The presence of strange attractors connotes poor predictability. Sustaining agricultural systems requires the ability to predict departures from preferred reference states and in the limit to predict approaching extinction. A suitable model needs to be heuristic. Such a model should provide several features for managers and policy makers. It should incorporate learning about the minimum sustainable ecospheric threshold, preferred reference states, and the dynamics of departures from those reference states. Predictions of the model should reveal how to maneuver parameters in order to achieve 'favorable' system dynamics. That is why most of our attention is placed on exploring the range of parameters in which strange attractors occur or do not occur. The policy problem for sustainable agriculture is consequently defined as preventing strange attractors from appearing.
   Simulations show that strange attractors may be avoided and replaced by stable periodic trajectories or stable nodes by changing the coefficient of ecospheric recovery, terms of trade, or the productivity of the ecosphere in agricultural uses. Agricultural terms of trade and ecospheric recovery coefficients are partially substitutable in sustaining agriculture and improving predictability.
   The results suggest that sustainability is sensitive to learning processes which address tradeoffs among the parameters, minimum thresholds of persistence for the ecosphere and mutualism in economic predation. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1997.

AB The utilization of N-2-fixing trees (NFTs) in agroforestry, in semiarid regions, is often limited by weak N-2 fixation. This study was conducted to evaluate the N-2-fixing capacity of trees growing under natural conditions for 10 years with neither chemical fertilizer nor inoculum application. For this purpose, natural isotopic N-15 abundance (delta(15)N) of leaves harvested from NFTs and reference plants (ren growing in three agroecological zones of Senegal were analyzed. Ar each sire (one site per zone), average ref was calculated N contents and delta(15)N values increased from the north in the Sudano-Sahelian zone (Bambey and Nioro) to the south in the sub-Guinean zone (Djibelor). The percentage of fixed N-2 (%Ndfa) was low at both Bambey (Ndfa less than or equal to 22%) and Nioro (Ndfa less than or equal to 39%) and very high at Djibelor (76% less than or equal to Ndfa less than or equal to 95%). To explain the law levels of Ndfa observed at Bambey and Nioro, the hypothesis of lack of Bradyrhizobium strains in these soils was made. This hypothesis was confirmed by results obtained from a trial conducted under controlled conditions, which showed absence of nodulation on Gliricidia sepium growing under optimal conditions of water and nutrient supply. Improvement of N-2 fixation of NFTs in the semiarid zone is a prerequisite for implementation of sustainable agroforestry systems.

AB This paper examines the structure of a Lepidoptera assemblage in an urban environment in South Africa. The Lepidoptera inhabit fungus-induced galls on Acacia karroo. Habitat patches supporting the moth assemblage were sampled from rural, urban-reserve, suburban and city sites and the habitat quality at each of these sites was quantified. Gall occupancy, larval density and species richness were lowest at the most disturbed, city sites. Non-parametric multivariate techniques showed that the moth-assemblage structure did not differ significantly at rural and urban-reserve sites. Assemblage structure at the suburban sites was variable and appeared to be transitional in structure between the city assemblage and the rural and urban-reserve assemblages. Habitat quality variables however were weakly correlated with moth-assemblage structure. The contribution of urban reserves to the local sustainability of this Lepidoptera assemblage emphasizes the importance of maintaining 'green' areas in and around cities.

AB This article considers the conservation of relict natural habitat in West Africa, especially habitat preserved in traditional sacred groves. Government-sanctioned conservation is contrasted with local grassroots efforts of conservation. Evidence for the ecological value of sacred groves is based on results of a field study of small mammal communities conducted on the Accra Plains of Ghana and on published sources on the conservation and use of sacred groves from various countries. The study employed standard mark-and-recapture techniques for the sampling for terrestrial small mammals, and mist netting for the sampling of bat communities. Pragmatic approaches combining conservation and sustainable use are considered, as are traditional values that have preserved the sacred groves in the past for up to several hundred years in some cases. In part because these groves shelter unique small mammal and plant communities, traditional values and protection mechanisms should be integrated into the newly emerging cultural and religious contexts. The issues encountered during this study reveal that effective conservation involving local peoples requires a concerted interdisciplinary effort.

DE sooty tern; Sterna fuscata; habitat use; habitat management; sustainable
   exploitation
AB The relationship between sooty tern Sterna fuscata nest densities and vegetation characteristics of the breeding colonies was investigated on four islands in the Seychelles. Nest densities were greatest in areas with a vegetation caller of 30-50%, and areas that provided these conditions were generally dominated by pourpier Portulaca oleracea. On Aride Island sooty terns nested at low density under an enclosed tree canopy but on the other islands nests were generally in the open, among sparse vegetation. On Desnoeufs Island, where eggs are harvested commercially for human consumption, sooty terns avoided nesting in dense areas of epi bleu Stachytarpheta jamaicensis, an introduced plant whose success on the island may be related to egg exploitation. Management of colony vegetation, especially the control of introduced aggressive species, and the encouragement of optimum conditions for nesting, could increase the numbers of nesting sooty terns and their reproductive output, helping to buffer them against adverse effects of human activity. Appropriate protection of sooty tern colonies can also benefit rarer and more vulnerable seabirds and turtles that share nesting islands. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Unduplicated counts of female grizzly bears Ursus arctos horribilis with cubs-of-the-year are currently used to estimate minimum population sizes used, in turn, to calculate allowable (assumed to equal sustainable) mortality for grizzly bear populations in the contiguous United States of America. This calculation assumes that unduplicated counts are an unbiased and accurate indicator of population size and that the ratios of minimum population size and known mortality to their respective totals are equal. Neither of these assumptions can be directly tested. However in this paper I use data from the Yellowstone ecosystem, 1977-1990, to evaluate two directly related but alternate hypotheses: (1) annual variation in unduplicated counts is explained by factors extraneous to the number of adult females in the population (i.e. search effort and sightability of females with cubs); and (2) there is > 10% risk of allowing unsustainable mortality (actual mortality rate > 6%) given a plausible, uniform range of population and mortality ratios. My results are consistent with accepting both of these hypotheses. I therefore concluded that unduplicated counts varied without a known relationship to population size and that, by normal standards, the method currently adopted for management of grizzly bear populations in the contiguous United States was not a conservative basis for calculating maximum allowable mortality. I suggest that using lower mortality rates and conservative bounds of confidence limits for the estimated parameters used in calculations of allowable mortality could substantially reduce the risk of unintentionally allowing excessive mortality.

AB Governments and businesses alike are increasingly taking account of environmental concerns in their own operations, with an overall objective of moving towards a sustainable society, i.e, one that meets the needs of today without compromising the well-being of future generations. Telecommunications has nor been viewed as an activity that causes severe environmental problems and has, therefore, been omitted from the debate at leaching solutions to current problems. The collaborative project described in this paper, in which BT played a leading role, undertook to produce a network operators' charter which would commit telecommunications' providers to certain minimum levels of environmental behaviour. To meet these levels, internal activities have been assessed and best practices developed for adoption, The commercial and societal benefits in using telecommunications services were also modelled so provide an estimate of the advantages to be gained.

AB People's science movements (PSMs) have become an important but little studied recent phenomenon in India Originating in anticaste thinking of the 1950s, PSMs attempt to popularize nonmystical, scientific thinking, especially among India's rural poor. Many PSMs have evolved into significant centers of activism against social inequality and for environmental protection. The original and largest PSM in India is Kerala's KSSP, with more than 50,000 members. KSSP's history illustrates the changing focus of PSMs and shows that the organization has been able to influence many developments in Kerala over the past 30 years, including protection of the species-rich Silent Valley, improving the schools, promoting discussion of alternative plans for agriculture, industry, and electrical power, campaigning against unsafe drugs, fostering total literacy, installing high-efficiency cooking stoves, and conducting an innovative people's resource mapping campaign. When the 1996 Left Democratic Front Ministry decided to launch a people's campaign for local-level development planning, I(SSP became a major mobilizing force for the campaign.

AB Biodiversity priorities for Canadian agriculture are to: (1) preserve vanishing genetic diversity of domesticated species and their wild relatives using ex situ techniques; (2) conserve wild crop relatives in nature; (3) protect wild habitats, which supply natural pools of pollinators, beneficial soil organisms and control agents of crop pests, and which may harbour as yet unidentified economically valuable species; (4) expand environmentally-friendly agriculture, including low-input and organic agriculture, integrated pest management and soil conservation; (5) minimize the impacts of agricultural practices that degrade planetary life-support systems; (6) employ the biodiversity enhancing properties of crop diversification; (7) minimize risks from release of genetically engineered organisms; (8) develop sustainability as a concept of benefit to both biodiversity and agriculture; (9) promote harmony between agriculture and environmentalism by making biodiversity and the protection of wildlife sustainably profitable; and (10) invest in biodiversity research.

TI Tribal politics and discourses of environmentalism
SO CONTRIBUTIONS TO INDIAN SOCIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB In India, state-led developmentalism has recently been challenged by the discourse of environmentalism. Among the various streams of environmentalism, Ecological Marxism has been the most dominant. Its marrying of two concerns-social justice and ecological sustainability-has made this ideology highly appealing to social activists working with tribal communities in western india. Yet closer examination reveals that the dynamics of tribal politics often strain against lire discourse of environmentalism and have an ambivalent attitude towards development. This paper analyses conflicts between middle-class activists and tribal leaders within a trade union of tribal peasants in Madhya Pradesh and argues that their disparate political strategies and postures stem from sharp differences in the ways in which they conceptualise the place of the 'tribal' in relation to 'nature'. The paper shows that the discourse of environmentalism is neither consistent nor complete, but consists of the interweaving of often contradictory political thought and action.

TI Management practices to reduce gray leaf spot of maize
SO CROP SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
ID CERCOSPORA-ZEAE-MAYDIS; DISEASE PROGRESS; CORN
AB The beneficial effects of stubble tillage on soil and water conservation are widely recognized, but surface stubble also increases the potential for crop damage by fungal pathogens that overwinter in the previous season's debris. In recent Sears, gray leaf spot (GLS) has become a major yield-limiting disease, resulting in grain yield losses as high as 60% in high yield potential maize (Zea mays L.) production areas. A study was launched to investigate strategies that could be adopted to facilitate the continuation of conservation tillage practices without exposing maize to unnecessarily high risk from GLS, The aim of the study was to investigate the interactive effects of four tillage practices leaving varying amounts of surface residues and fungicide treatments for the control of stubble-associated pathogens, In the hot, dry season, unfavorable for GLS, the onset of disease was 23 d earlier in no-till with higher disease than conventional tillage, The benefits of conserved soil moisture under stubble tillage with concomitant higher grain yields than conventional tillage offset the detrimental effects of higher disease. Results from the study indicate that tillage practices are unlikely to have a major impact in managing GLS; since the mean yield of conventional tillage with minimal stubble (3% residue), during four seasons, was between 28 and 209 kg ha(-1) lower than tillage treatments leaving 82 and 26% stubble on the soil surface, respectively. During the four seasons of the study, grain yield responses to fungicide treatment ranged from 477 kg ha(-1) in unfavorable seasons to 3830 kg ha(-1) in seasons favorable for GLS, The judicious application of fungicides will reduce the risk of financial loss from GLS and will allow the continuation of the desirable stubble tillage practice in sustainable farming systems.

DT Article
AB Lack of formal security of land tenure is often cited as a constraint fbr participatory land management programmes which try to motivate African farmers to grow trees and to realize other improvements in their fields in order to control soil erosion. According to this approach, the borrowing of land would represent an insecure form of land tenure hindering sustainable land use. However, on the basis of a case study in Burkina Faso, this article demonstrates that this is not necessarily so: borrowing arrangements may play a part in avoiding local overload of the carrying capacity and in an efficient distribution of village lands among the farming units. Furthermore, borrowing does not hinder some major intensification techniques of land use which are currently being applied in Burkina Faso. Legal interventions which aim to increase security of tenure and to create favourable conditions for sustainable land use may in fact have the opposite effect.

DE cost externalisation; structural dumping; (World) social dual system
AB In the last 250 years, capitalism has been the cause of great wealth and affluence. This was brought about by the interaction between a dynamic mobilisation of resources and the efficient allocation of production factors, produced goods and services through control of the market, technical progress, the spread of trade and use of comparative cost advantages. In this respect, classical and neoclassical economics since Adam Smith has been proven correct. However, this school's postulation that the market's invisible hand will also provide for a balanced development of wealth between rich and poor regions and nations has not been proven correct. On the contrary, the gap between rich and poor has grown. The contradiction between theory and reality is not at all coincidental. Classical and neoclassical economics subordinate absolute equal opportunities between all (world) market actors and exclude extra-economic factors such as, for example, the disparity of power as a lever of wealth increment. Furthermore, it neglects the circumstance of capital accumulation and growth in consumption through the cost-free use of nature, which has many consequences for the destruction of the ecological balance. These methodical foreclosure proceedings do not only have fatal consequences for the theory; politics is also especially affected. To be sure, neoclassicism offers no solutions to the greatest challenges of the present, namely, social inequality on a global scale and the ecological crisis. The individual measures which have been enacted, such as the IMF's structural adjustment programme, often cause the opposite social and ecological effects. An important prerequisite for the development of strategies in a global reform perspective is, therefore, the dealing with some fundamental deficits in the dominant economic theory. This paper will (a) develop the idea that the disparity of political and economic power has historically promoted the externalisation of social and ecological costs and, as a result, caused the rise of non-sustainable structures in the world economy as well as social and ecological crises, and (b) prove that cost internalisation by means of new basic conditions in the world economy is an indispensable must for sustainable development in the world economy.

AB Commercially important species often are overexploited, and many endangered mammals and birds are threatened by hunting and international trade. To sustain biological resources requires harvesting strategies that maximize yield while accounting for stochastic dynamics, uncertainty, and risk of resource collapse or extinction. For a large class of population dynamics, the optimal strategy is to harvest all individuals above a threshold population size, with no harvest below the threshold. Maximizing the expected cumulative harvest before extinction puts the optimal threshold at carrying capacity, regardless of the form of expected dynamics or the magnitude of stochasticity. Maximizing the mean annual yield lowers the optimal threshold, which then depends on the form of expected dynamics and the magnitude of stochasticity. Uncertainty in estimated population sizes increases the threshold, and with large uncertainty, the optimal strategy is proportional threshold harvesting, involving harvest of only a fraction of the excess in estimated population above the threshold. The theoretical justification for the common strategy of a constant harvest rate is extremely weak in comparison to that for optimal threshold strategies. Thresholds are a necessary feature of any harvesting strategy with the objective of minimizing risks of resource depletion or extinction, while optimizing yields.

DE geoindicators; sustainability; ecosystem
AB Geoindicators are high-resolution measures of short-term (<100 years) surface or nearsurface changes in earth processes, and phenomena that are significant for environmental monitoring and assessment. They are based on standard concepts and procedures and can be used to track changes in fluvial, coastal, desert, mountain, permafrost and other terrestrial areas. Geoindicators assess both catastrophic events and those that are more gradual, but evident within a human lifespan. Most deal with changes on the landscape (0.1-10 km) and meso-scales (10-100 km), but some, such as relative sea level and volcanic unrest, have regional and global dimensions. Some are complex and costly to measure, others are relatively simple and easy to apply. Geoindicators can also be used to unravel trends over the past few centuries and longer through paleoenvironmental research, thus providing the important baselines against which human-induced and natural stresses can be better understood. Geoindicators have been designed by the International Union of Geological Sciences as an aid to state-of-the-environment reporting and long-term ecological monitoring.

   sustainability
AB Suggestions for defining and measuring sustainable development can broadly be placed in two categories: weak and strong sustainability. The concept of weak sustainability assumes that manufactured and natural capital are close substitutes, This means that the costs of environmental deterioration (e.g. groundwater damage) can be compensated by benefits from manufactured capital (e.g. income). Thus, environmental damage is valued in monetary units, The concept of strong sustainability denies the degree of substitution that weak sustainability assumes, at least for some critical elements of natural capital. This paper endorses the use of strong sustainability indicators, especially for critical loads and critical levels. These have to be pointed out by environmental scientists and/or geologists. Nevertheless, the costs and benefits of avoiding critical impacts have to be taken into consideration. Hence, a combination of strong and weak sustainability indicators is suggested.

AB It is legitimate to ask whether and in what form tourism might contribute to sustainable development. This is not the same as sustainable tourism which, as a single-sector approach to development, may overlook important linkages with other sectors. if tourism is to contribute to sustainable development, then it must be economically viable, ecologically sensitive and culturally appropriate. Ecotourism is often advocated as being a sustainable form of tourism but imprecision in terminology clouds basic issues and there are strong economic, ecological, and cultural reasons for believing that, even in its purest forms, ecotourism is likely to present substantial challenges to destination areas, particularly if it competes for scarce resources and displaces existing uses and users. Sustainable tourism and ecotourism are not synonyms, many forms of ecotourism may not be sustainable, and if ecotourism is to contribute to sustainable development, then careful planning and management will be required.

SO ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT

ID RENEWABLE ENERGY; TRENDS
AB The impacts of global warming are among the more serious environmental threats far the Pacific Island countries. These nations justifiably argue that developed countries should give immediate priority to the implementation of climate change mitigation policies because of the severe nature of potential greenhouse impacts for the Pacific Islands. Another immediate priority acknowledged by these nations is the need for development of adaptation policies that plan for adjustment or adaptation, where possible, to the foreshadowed impacts of climate change.
   This article does not focus on adaptation or mitigation policy directly but on an allied opportunity that exists for the Pacific Islands via the auspices of the Climate Convention, because the existing very costly energy systems used in the Pacific island region are fossil-fuel dependent. It is argued here that efforts can be made towards the development of energy systems that are ecologically sustainable because Pacific Island nations are eligible to receive assistance to introduce renewable energy technology and pursue energy conservation via implementation mechanisms of the Climate Convention and, in particular through transfer of technology and via joint implementation.
   II is contended that assistance in the form of finance, technology, and human resource development from developed countries and international organizations would provide sustainable benefits in improving the local Pacific island environments. It is also emphasized that mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions is not the responsibility of the Pacific Islands as they contribute very little on a per capita global scale and a tiny proportion of total global greenhouse gas emissions.

AB Low levels of phosphorus limit the yield of pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum) grown on acid sandy soils of the West African Sahel. The application of phosphorus and the recycling of millet residues produces large increases in the total dry matter and grain yields of millet but little is known about the effects of these amendments on the by-products of millet fields which include weeds and millet leaves at harvest. Phosphorus applied at 13 kg ha(-1) as single superphosphate and millet residues applied at 500 or 2000 kg ha(-1) as a mulch or as the ash from 2000 kg millet residues ha(-1) that had been burned, increased dry matter yields of millet leaves and weeds leading to large increments in the total in vitro metabolizable energy harvested per unit area. These increases in dry matter production were only accompanied by minor decreases in the concentration of crude protein. The increased availability of millet by-products should be taken into account when evaluating the effects of phosphorus and crop residue application on the economy and sustainability of agro-pastoral farming systems in the West African Sahel.

ID PHOSPHORUS FERTILIZATION; INTERCEPTION; YIELD
AB Four contrasting Varieties of cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) were grown for ten months over two consecutive seasons in hillside Colombia with or without nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium fertilization. Sequential harvests were every two months. The two varieties well adapted to acid soils (CM 489-1 and CM 523-7) had higher yields and exhibited the strongest response to fertilization, highest solar radiation use efficiency, earlier canopy ground cover and higher leaf litter accumulation. The export of potassium, however, was no higher than in the other genotypes, mainly as a consequence of higher potassium use efficiency in the adapted varieties. Significant amounts of total calcium, magnesium and nitrogen accumulated in the whole plant were recycled in the leaf litter during growth. High-yielding varieties adapted to acid soils did not exacerbate soil fertility problems of cassava crops; rather, they were beneficial. Certain growth parameters could be used to select for varieties with low impact on soil fertility.

AB Due to leakages, spills, improper disposal and accidents during transport, organic compounds have become subsurface contaminants that threaten important drinking water resources. One strategy to remediate such polluted subsurface environments is to make use of the degradative capacity of bacteria. It is often sufficient to supply the subsurface with nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus, and aerobic treatments are still dominating. However, anaerobic processes have advantages such as low biomass production and good electron acceptor availability, and they are sometimes the only possible solution. This review will focus on three important groups of environmental organic contaminants: hydrocarbons, chlorinated and nitroaromatic compounds. Whereas hydrocarbons are oxidized and completely mineralized under anaerobic conditions in the presence of electron accepters such as nitrate, iron, sulfate and carbon dioxide, chlorinated and nitroaromatic compounds are reductively transformed. For the aerobic often persistent polychlorinated compounds, reductive dechlorination leads to harmless products or to compounds that are aerobically degradable. The nitroaromatic compounds are first reductively transformed to the corresponding amines and can subsequently be bound to the humic fraction in an aerobic process. Such new findings and developments give hope that in the near future contaminated aquifers can efficiently be remediated, a prerequisite for a sustainable use of the precious subsurface drinking water resources.

AB Recent advances in gain legume biotechnology are reviewed. Emphasis is given on field testing and commercialization of transgenic grain legumes. The absence of variety-independent gene transfer methods for major agronomic species has, until now, limited the usefulness of recombinant DNA techniques to crop improvement programs. Direct DNA transfer techniques into organized and easily regenerable tissue provided the breakthrough to achieve effective and practical gene transfer into important leguminous species. In principle, we are now in the position to introduce any foreign gene into almost all major legumes, in some cases in a variety-independent fashion. This, however, can only be achieved routinely in few laboratories, all located in industrialized countries. A number of the more important of the leguminous crops, particularly those utilized for human consumption are important components of sustainable agricultural production systems in the developing world. We must bridge the gap between industrialized and developing countries before legume biotechnology can be utilized effectively for crop improvement, particularly in the developing world. Technology transfer becomes an important issue and links amongst corporate research organizations, academic institutions and international organizations need to be strengthened to avoid duplication of effort and to maximize efficient utilization of limited resources. In this chapter, advantages of the various gene delivery methods that were shown to be useful for specific crops, as well as limitations and problems associated with each crop and gene transfer method will be discussed. In addition, we will focus on specific biotechnology goals targeted for particular crops. Important oilseed and feed species as well as minor but equally important species for sustaining growing populations in developing countries are discussed. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

TI Catch, effort and sampling strategies in the highly variable sardine

ID YIELD
AB Temporal and spatial patterns in the fishery for Sardinella spp. around East Java, Indonesia, were studied in an attempt to develop an efficient catch and effort sampling strategy for this highly variable fishery. The inter-annual and monthly variation in catch, effort and catch per unit of effort (cpue) are quantified and discussed, using official catch reports and reports from local village cooperatives. In 1993 the total catch of Sardinella spp. in East Java was 56000 tonnes and the total effort was equivalent to 5000 units of purse seine. A maximum sustainable yield (MSY) of 40 000 tonnes of sardines is estimated, at an optimum effort of 3000 units of purse seine. The present study focuses on the purse seine fishery since this fishery accounts for more than 50% of all sardines landed in East Java. Purse seiners use lamps to attract fish and peak catches are landed around the new moon. Catches are smaller towards the full moon, when the fishery is inactive during a period of 10 days. Considerable differences exist between monthly catches from peak seasons and monthly catches from off-seasons. The fishery is further characterized by a relatively large amount of zero catches. A catch and effort data recording system (CEDRS) is developed based on the analysis of temporal variation in cpue and effort in the purse seine fishery for sardines. A purse seine fleet, with a variable size of 40 to 70 vessels, was sampled in Probolinggo harbour at the Madura Strait, during 4 to 6 days per month from March 1990 until March 1991. The overall mean effort of the fleet was 36.1 trips per day, of which on average 12.6 trips per day resulted in non-zero catches. The geometric mean cpue over the non-zero catches was 404 kg per trip. The proposed CEDRS has an accuracy of 30% for the estimated annual catch, 21% for the cpue and 9% for the effort (non-zero catches). A minimum required number of 4 sampling days per month is calculated for the temporally stratified CEDRS, with months used as strata within years, and lunar phases as strata within months. For this purpose, the lunar cycle is divided in three lunar phases, one around the full moon, one around half moon and one around the new moon. Within the proposed CEDRS, no sampling takes place in the lunar phase around full moon, when the fishery is inactive. The sample of 4 days per month is proportionally allocated over the other two lunar phases. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

TI Leadership and governance in world forestry: A discussion paper
SO FORESTRY CHRONICLE
LA English
DT Article
AB Is improved world leadership in forestry feasible and is it imminent? The way UN international forest institutions are governed has a profound effect on their performance. The availability of resources and the responsiveness to sector issues in developing appropriate and coherent policies and programs are defining features of the quality of leadership. By any measure, funding and human resources are in extremely short supply among a fractionated and scattered number of small and relatively ineffective UN international forest institutions. A critical objective of institutional reform will be to enhance the effective representation of ministers responsible for forests (and not surrogates from agriculture, trade or environment ministries), the commercial private sector and representative citizen groups. Three options are explored for institutional reform with particular emphasis on the third.
   The first would be a minimalist approach. It would see the creation of a World Forest Programme in association with FAO similar to the World Food Programme. The second option to creating a new governance structure for more direct representation of forest interests would lead to the creation of a new UN ''Forest Council'' of ministers responsible for forests apart from FAO and other UN forest agencies that would guide international forest policy dialogue. A third option would result in the creation of a ''hybrid'' institution, the Global Alliance for Forests and Sustainable Development (GLOBALFOR), which would be established outside the UN but could be more successful than other options in building a sound and modem governance structure among all interested parties, including governments, industry and NGOs that is open, inclusive and participatory.
   Institutional reform of international forest institutions is important and urgent and demands the attention of UN reformers and independent assessors. Reform could result in fewer institutions at lower cost and increased resources for more effective global forest related activity.

TI A method for enhancing tree species proportions from aerial photos
SO FORESTRY CHRONICLE
LA English
DT Article
DE photo interpretation; tree species proportions; forest inventories;
   matrix model
ID DIVERSITY; INDEXES
AB Data on tree species richness of forests are needed for sustainable management. Photo interpreted data is a mainstay of forest inventories in Canada but is known to simplify the species composition of stands in accordance with the objective of providing stand descriptors. Species proportions estimated from aerial photos will often deviate significantly from ground based sample estimates. More tree species are usually found in the latter. To enhance photo-interpreted species proportions to better match ground observations this study proposes a cross-correlation memory matrix model as the most promising approach to a notoriously difficult problem. Ground and photo data from 246 stands in three sites in coastal BC were used for model estimation and validation. Enhanced photo-based tree species proportions were, in most stands, closer to the ground estimates than the raw estimates. Changes in species proportions due to enhancement appeared reasonable when considering the actual species mix and stand structures. Two popular indices of species richness derived from photo proportions were biased downward. The proposed method effectively reduced the bias in one index. The model is easy to implement in operational inventories.
